Hey everyone! My insurance just went through for my recent SRS (PIV) at the University of Utah Hospital.
</p>
<p>
Surgeons were Cori Agarwal and Ben McCormick.
</p>
<p>
I work at a tech company based in Washington, so I am very lucky to have had everything covered and approved so smoothly. Unfortunately, no electrolysis was covered due to electrology being a more independent practice here, so rarely anybody partners with insurance. As you can see, the vast majority of the actual cost I paid was due to electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
A few other notes:
</p>
<p>
- I had to get Santyl cream out-of-pocket rather than covered through insurance due to the prior authorization process taking too long. I think this may have been an issue with the U of U not responding in time, because I had countless phonecalls with wallgreens trying to get it covered before just deciding to bite the bullet and pay for it out of pocket. Sanyl is a debriding agent meant to clear dead tissue when dilating for the first month.
</p>
<p>
- I also had to get a few early refills due to me doing electrolysis twice a week towards the end and EMLA cream being the only thing that worked to manage the pain (still hurt like hell)
</p>
<p>
- I saw three different electrologists in total. I have blonde hair down there, so laser does nothing for me (and apparently it grows back anyways for some people). I also saw a malpracticing electrologist for 5 months.
</p>
<p>
- I still see some hair in the area even after over a year and a half of electrolysis. There&#39;s pretty much a huge bald spot where it was treated, and only a few hairs growing on the outside area. None that bother me too much at this point though.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Electrologists I recommend:
</p>
<p>
- Salt City Electrolysis in Draper—pricey but the technicians are all very efficient for what you&#39;re paying for. They do the thermolysis method.
</p>
<p>
- Courtney Leonard in American Fork—She does blend method, and is a bit slower, but that&#39;s just how blend/galvanic is in general. Super professional and nice.
</p>
<p>
Electrologist I highly do not recommend:
</p>
<p>
- Karen Bitner. She used to be a teacher at Cameo, but her technique is tantamount to malpractice. She was appealing to a lot of my friends due to her charging half the prices of most electrolysis places in Utah, but unfortunately seeing her for 5 months actually set back my progress due to her treating hairs (without extracting) and then waxing the area at the end of each session. This technique set back my progress and only strengthened the hairs more when they grew back.

You have fantastic insurance it appears with a low out of pocket maximum.
</p>
<p>
Have you tried to get reimbursed for the electrolysis?

I might be able to call in but my guess is no because they want pre-approval before you even start the electrolysis plan, and they want you to do it at a
<em>
very
</em>
slow pace. My ex did a reimbursement plan, and they would only cover 30 minutes per week;  reimbursements would only come in after 2 months after you submitted a very detailed receipt (I also didn&#39;t keep any receipts for the electrolysis I got).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I think if I went through insurance it would legit take me 4 years to get this surgery instead of almost 2 years. I had to do 2 x 1-hour sessions per week in the last 8 months before the surgery, and I still didn&#39;t get all of my hairs removed by that point.

Honestly that&#39;s most countries though. Even in many countries with free healthcare, not all of them recognize electrolysis / surgery as necessary, so you&#39;d have to pay out of pocket or go to another country for it. In America you&#39;re basically paying the insurance companies to give you a somewhat reasonable price on the surgery.

Oh yeah everywhere else is full price.  Just thought that US insurance just turns them into freebies.

Oh wow. Yeah, electrolysis really adds up. I can&#39;t imagine doing 5 years of that too.
</p>
<p>
I started doing face for a few sessions after I recovered enough (I was basically cleared to do it as soon as 3 weeks post op), and man face is really ****ing hard.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I have HSV-1 and super sensitive and I had the worst cold sore breakout of my life after my last electrolysis session. I gave up pretty quickly and just decided that I&#39;m gonna be shaving my beard for the rest of my life, cause it&#39;s blonde and I can&#39;t laser it. It&#39;s so dysphoria inducing to me to have to grow out your beard for 3-4 days, and then have red/acne prone skin in the beard areas for the remaining days of the week. I hope you&#39;ve been seeing good results in your case though!
