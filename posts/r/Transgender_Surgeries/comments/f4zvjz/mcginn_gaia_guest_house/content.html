I stayed there. It&#39;s not a bad place to be, especially if you have the energy to meet some of the other trans people recovering there. It&#39;s in a good location, the breakfasts are good, and the price is quite reasonable. The downsides:
</p>
<p>
1) The rooms aren&#39;t terribly well set up for people who have to be bedridden the whole time they&#39;re there.
</p>
<p>
2) If you have a helper with you, and don&#39;t want to share a bed, your helper is going to wind up on a *very* uncomfortable folding bed or cot.
</p>
<p>
3) One of the mangers there went on a couple of unprovoked conservative rants while I was there, including one about how &#34;transgender surgeries will never be like the real thing.&#34; I can brush that sort of thing off because I know more than he does about it, but if you&#39;re in a bad place or recovering from one of the surgeries he&#39;s talking about, it could hit pretty hard. Fortunately it&#39;s pretty easy to avoid contact with the people who work there if you want to.

My mom will be staying with me for likely the entire time (7 days after release from the hospital).  So a hotel would be nice for her.  How terrible are the fold out beds there?  She was thinking she would purchase a air mattress need be.  Do you think there&#39;d be room for one on the floor?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s pretty shitty about the manager.  Seems weird they&#39;d choose to work there given that view...

Yeah. That whole conversation was kind of shocking. I still don&#39;t know what he was thinking.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that an air mattress would be an improvement over some of the futon/fold-out stuff they have. There&#39;s room on the floor for a standard twin (one person) bed, in most rooms.

I haven’t been there but have read lots of accounts.
</p>
<p>
Lots of people mentioned getting to know the other girls there who just had their surgery. It might be nice to have others to relate to, compared to being isolated at a different hotel.

I have stayed there twice for two surgeries with McGinn. I also stayed in the Clarion because my second surgery required an extended stay. My take is this, if you can get the largest room and can afford it, stay at the Gaia. It is a nice, open, airy space that feels fairly private. The king bed is a little hard to get out off because of its oversized frame. That bed also is adjustable, which is nice. The bathroom is large, and the standing shower luxurious.
</p>
<p>
I stayed in the smaller room across the hall on my second visit and I could hear everything the guests in the room next-door said. The Clarion offers a little more noise insulation than that other room did. The breakfasts at the Gaia house are good, as is having a host who knows and is sympathetic.
</p>
<p>
I should say that I am a slow healer relative to other patiences and neither stay was pleasant. The Gaia was better than the Clarion because it is a nicer environment. I don&#39;t know how I would have dealt with housekeeping at the Clarion in the early stages of recovery.
</p>

Best wishes to you!

The Clarion is one of the hotels I had looked at.  Good to know it was OK enough for you.  I hadn&#39;t thought about housekeeping...that&#39;s a legitimate concern.

Yes. I’ve stayed at the Clarion lots of times for pre-op visits and follow ups. I have always found it fine. And you avoid the traffic of downtown.

I had the big room at GAIA and it was amazing. Fit 3 people just fine. I’m guessing it’s probably still cheaper than a hotel plus breakfasts are included. The other 2 rooms upstairs still seemed nice, the downstairs were a bit cold

Thanks for the feedback.  Was there a typical breakfast served?  I&#39;m really picky about what I eat.  For other meals, were you able to use the kitchen facilities?  What about laundry?
</p>
<p>
I hadn&#39;t thought about room temperatures.  That&#39;s a bonus to a hotel room, private thermostat.  I&#39;m imagining comfort will be a top priority for me...

I guess the main dish was typically some kind of egg, but not always. There are tons of choices though. You’ll have a kitchenette but won’t really be allowed to use the main kitchen. I don’t think you can use their laundry either. You will have a thermostat though I don’t know how great a difference they make. The person I visited downstairs just had the room kinda cold; mine was generally on the warm side. I very much would recommend staying there though.
