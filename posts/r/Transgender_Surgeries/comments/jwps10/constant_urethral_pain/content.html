I am almost three years post op and urinating for me after SRS has been a  completely different experience. I&#39;m always feeling that there is an  obstruction every time I have to go and that I have to constantly pee.  I suffer from overactive bladder,  incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty starting a stream and a weak urinary stream.  I&#39;ve seen a urologist on a monthly basis and they&#39;ve looked into my  urethra and bladder with a camera, and there is no stricture. I&#39;ve done so many test  including a urodynamics exam where you pee and they x-ray your flow at the same time. And nothing either.  The way I  would describe is that every time i feel and need to go use the bathroom  my urethral sphincter muscles doesn&#39;t want to open up and I have to  hold my breath to start my stream.  I have a harder time going now. I  don&#39;t know if this could be neurological/nerve damage from the surgery.  But I miss how effortlessly urinating was for me before the surgery. We  take  things for granted in life.  Especially as simple as going to the   bathroom.

So, lots of blood, stitches, recurring UTIs... Maybe urethral stricture/scarring causing retention/difficulty when peeing. Thus the UTI issues. Else the erectile tissue could be the problem. Have you seen a urologist to take a look? Have you done a urethral x-ray, urethroscopy or retrograde urethrogram?

I would suggest seeing a urologist. Frankly it&#39;s ridiculous to just throw tons of antibiotics at someone with a history of multiple UTIs a year without investigating potential causes, especially with the ongoing pain issues that you have.
