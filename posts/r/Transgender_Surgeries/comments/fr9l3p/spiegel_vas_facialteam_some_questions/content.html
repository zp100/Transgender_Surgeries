So far I’ve done consults with Spiegel, Beck, and FacialTeam. I have consults with Lazaro Cardenas and Ley coming up. I wasn’t super thrilled by Beck’s experience, and his gameplan seemed a bit on the conservative side as far as feminizing my face goes. I liked Spiegel, and I liked Dr Gutierrez in Spain. I’m wondering if anyone has had any experience with either of them, and could possibly share their experiences?
</p>
<p>
Idk if it helps, but Spiegel was recommending: a lip lift, forehead contouring, mandible contouring, and a tracheal shave (per my request). Nothing to the nose and no hairline work, since he said a scalp advancement would work sufficiently and reduce time and costs.
</p>
<p>
FacialTeam was recommending: Hair transplants, nose work, chin reduction (with no work on the mandible outside of that), nose work, forehead contouring, and a tracheal shave (per my request). He says he dislikes scalp advancements since he believes them to not be as feminizing as they should be.
</p>
<p>
To anyone who has been to these people and had these operations: what are you happiest with? Are you dissatisfied with anything in particular? How much did you pay? Did your recovery go well, or were there complications?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for any help you can provide!

I have no experience with the other two but FacialTeam does their coronal incision which tends to raise the hairline slightly, so that is probably why they often recommend hair transplants. It seems to be a little bit expensive, but if you can afford it it seems to come out well.
</p>
<p>
I had everything they recommended to you plus jaw shaving but no hair transplants and it was about 30k euro (33k dollars?). They are very friendly and professional and staying there is more like a nice vacation. Personally, I regret so much going with them because they were far too conservative. The results are very natural like they are known for (noone can tell I have gotten anything done!), but it is too subtle for a hyper ugly like me :( Also, even though it is early to tell my nose is very bad and I have read similar exepiences nose wise about FT on here.

Are you talking about Spiegel in Boston? I personally think that Spiegel’s work is clocky.  I wish he showed a lot of his work online. Although he usually works on many faces...I wish I could’ve seen a lot more. I saw one you tuber who looks great then another and she only looks great with makeup :/ honestly I want to look great without makeup :/ so what do u think. Also when u say conservative do u mean that u r afraid that they’re not gonna do the most work on u just subtle work? U want ur face to be like done up, like amazing done, correct? The point of FFS is to relieve dysphoria so I am not 100% on Spiegel or any other who doesn’t show as much work...I personally am going to Dr. Otaké  in CT...he doesn’t have before and after but my friend has gone to the surgeon who Otaké studied under, which performs many of these surgeries and her Face is so flawless so I have to basically pray that he does a great job because there aren’t any photos but I’m just going on the work that my friend has had from her surgeon in which he has studied under. Anyways, I’ll be doing subtle work because I’m very scared to make that full 100% choice so I’m gonna do brow lift, HYA Fillers on face and lips for symmetry and hair line lowering on the edges. So it’s very subtle oh and my nose...I’m so fkn scared so I am glad he’s understanding slow and steady before I make a full decision on something permanent... later on I’ll see to it for my forehead shave if needed and permanent fat transfer to where the HYA filler would be if I agree to the amount of filler. Mind u, I am feminine and I am a makeup artist, so I have studied my face for years and I know I’d rather have a slow and steady start to this cuz I have seen that full on FFS and it freakin scared me to see the mistakes I see on these girls faces. I pray that anyone that goes through this journey in 2020 loved their results.

I live in Boston so spiegel was the easy choice for me. I think he is too conservative and I like that facial team is a bit more aggressive, but spiegel does do good forehead work and has a great reputation. I think I will try to politely steer him towards being more aggressive for me when I see him for pre-op consult.

I like subtlety to an extent, since it looks more natural, but I’d love to have some more aggressive work done on my chin and brow.

I’ve had friends who went to him and thought he was great. I know he did Stef Sanjrati, too. I’m just nervous he’s not going to do enough with my chin and brow and I’m not going to pass. I met my friend after she had her FFS and she has no pre-FFS photos around, so Idk what she looked like before. She passes really well, and insists that Spiegel is great, but she may not have needed too much work.

I wouldn&#39;t trust what Stef Sanjati says too much. She&#39;s great at YouTube, but it doesn&#39;t mean she knows what&#39;s shes talking about.

Idk if she’s done a review for him, her FFS just turned out great. It’s on his website. Granted, her after pics have makeup, which seems like cheating.

I didn&#39;t consult with Spiegel but I did with two of his students (Mardirossian and Keojampa), as well as Facial Team. I chose Mardirossian. I did a write up on my consults (see my post history). I&#39;m happy with my results.

Oh my god, your results are A M A Z I N G 😍 Some of these people I’d never heard of. And I’m kinda bummed to hear that Cardenas wasn’t good, I’ve liked his aesthetics a lot. I also love how open he is about his prices.

Thanks. If you really like Cardenas&#39;s aesthetic, set up a consult. maybe I caught him on a bad day.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you haven&#39;t already, join the various facebook groups devoted to FFS. They are a good resource, even though the behavior of some of the members is not great.

He&#39;s the next closest surgeon to me if Ley can&#39;t fit me in fast enough. I lived in Mexico for years, so I&#39;d be right at home, too. I haven&#39;t been able to find any groups dedicated to FFS, do you know what any of them are called?

After a fair amount of research, I went with Spiegel for FFS in Boston.  It has been several years, so things may have changed.  I met a trans woman at Goldrush in Denver who is beautiful, so after some discussion she told me she had gone to Spiegel for some work.  I wasn&#39;t interested in radical procedures for fear of complications rather was looking for some tweaks to allow for me to pass better.  The first surgery included scalp advance, nose, lip shortening, mandible shaping, and eyes (lift).  The surgery was fine but aftercare was horrible.  About a year later, I wasn&#39;t satisfied and had a facelift and cheekpockets removed.  After all this, I felt my chin was still too blocky and had a 3rd surgery to correct that.  I am almost 60 now, so age becomes a factor.  But I mostly pass without makeup but my skin is pretty blotchy, so I wear makeup most of the time.  I wish that I only had to have one FFS surgery, so not sure I would use Spiegel again if I had it to do over.  But, I do look okay and I have no post surgery issues.  He did a great job on my nose, lip shortening, and mandible shaping.  Not real happy with the chin - while it is more rounded there are pockets on either side of it that make me look older.  I wouldn&#39;t do scalp advance again (for me) it wasn&#39;t that useful.  I have had hair transplants that have eliminated the typical receding hairline to the left and right.  These were way more effective compared to scalp advance.  Best to you.

In a covid world, proximity needs to be weighed upon much more heavily than before. They are both among the best in skill. Go to whichever is closer to you.

That’d be Ley, honestly, but she mainly does GCS and BA, and sometimes FFS and top surgery. It’s either Spiegel or Lazaro Cardenas that’s next closest. I think I’m going to go with Spiegel, tbh.

I went to Facial Team five years ago after getting consuls with both when I lived in the Boston area. I know people who went to Speigel and were devastated. I’ve also known people who were really happy. I went with FT at the time because they provided me with what I needed, no frills. For GRS I went to Ley due to living in AZ now, it’s not fun to travel far post op, I learned that from FFS. In the current landscape I would agree with the above sentiment that proximity is a good thing to keep in mind. As far as Dr. Ley doing FFS, I’d get a consul at the very least, especially if you live in the Scottsdale area. She is a talented surgeon but I haven’t seen her FFS results. That said, just getting a consul will give you an idea of questions to ask Speigel if you decide to get a consul with him as well. Idk—research.

That sucks to hear. A few years ago, she was pretty damn accessible. Like on a week’s notice practically. Anyway, yeah, get a consul. It’s worth it, her office is in a good part of town and the staff is super helpful.

I liked the staff, her before/after photos were good, she had a good idea of what could be done to feminize me, timelines for recovery, general outcomes, and very realistic and optimistic expectations of what she could do. And I’m only like 30 minutes away, so it’s ideally located.
