I am set to have bottom surgery soon but recently discovered that I have an ingurinal hernia. Will this affect my bottom surgery or can the surgery be done even with a hernia?

Can be an issue if large and extends down (indirect hernia)inguinal canal which is route for decent of the testicles into scrotum. Hernias can go into scrotum. Direct inguinal (thru muscle) and femoral hernias can also be an issue. Nonetheless, no reason canâ€™t be repaired same time of GCS.

I had an inguinal hernia and had a mesh repair about 4 years prior to my GRS. The surgeon didn&#39;t have any issue with this, and I think the two locations are far enough apart for there to be no major issue. X

...shouldnt affect having the surgery and if discussed beforehand they might even be able to corrective work on the hernia at the same time...unfortunately inguinal hernias are a real risk that goes along with tucking...
