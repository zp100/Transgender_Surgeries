I like the depth I got at 5.5 and it is a bit deeper than that, however I think the vulva is very small and I have a huge perineum, it works well, my bf and I are able to have sex I just don&#39;t like how it looks. Do you think I need a revision, please be honest. I also like to know if you know someone who is able to do that

It&#39;s up to you, but I do want to say that if your happy with depth, feeling, and function just remembered all bits look different. There is no one size/look when it comes to bits like that. It looks okay to me. Plus, depending on what you would want it to be like, would be extra surgeries that could potentially effect some of the parts you do like about it. I&#39;m ftm so I&#39;m not sure if my two cents applies here. (I wasn&#39;t sure if you were comfortable with certain terms regarding bottom stuff so that&#39;s why I left it out.)

Yes, I agree with you OP. That is an unsatisfactory aesthetic result. Itâ€™s a shame that all these new, inexperienced, and poorly trained surgeons are popping up to take advantage of trans women getting surgeries paid for by insurance, and then producing these novice results while the surgeon himself gets rich.

Yes, I think it could benefit from a revision.  There are good options in Cali like Min Jun, Wittenberg, and Satterwhite.  The good news is that it seems to have healed without complications.

The interlan area looks really good, but your whole vagina is very short and the perineum is very long so there&#39;s room to extend it. I&#39;d say that the labia is very minimal too. I would have a revision if I were in your position.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, you have healed very very well and apart from the aforementioned issues your vagina does look very good ðŸ¤©

Remember, every time you go under for a surgery it has major risks of complications. Also you risk losing functionality doing a revision. Does it bother you enough that if you had a revision and you lost functionality, would you be happier or less happy?
</p>
<p>
Personally I think you&#39;re falling to the imagery of vaginas in porn. There&#39;s so many variations of cis vaginas, each one is its own snowflake, so yours is no different, it is its own snowflake.
</p>
<p>
Personally when I get mine I&#39;d rather have functionality over aesthetics. I&#39;m betting no man will bat an eye at your vagina not just being another cis vagina, lol, there thought is there a hole I can put my penis in (that is in the right place on the body). Seriously if you have a hole and not a penis they aren&#39;t going to think a thing about it.
</p>
<p>
This is all your own mental thing, but if you have dysphoria over it, nothing we can do to tell you this is a &#34;normal&#34; looking vagina and that you shouldn&#39;t get a revision. So really its up to you on how much dysphoria it gives you to not have a &#34;porn star vagina&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Check out this:
<a href="https://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/images-galleries/all-ten-panels/">https://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/images-galleries/all-ten-panels/
</a>
</p>
<p>
It is plaster casts of 400 something vaginas and how different each one is to the other. Media distorts how vaginas actually look in real life. I saw at least one that was similar to yours with it being short and not having much labia.

It is a longer than average perineum, but I have seen natal vaginas that look fairly similar. I think it&#39;s up to your mental health needs, personally I wouldn&#39;t go for surgery again with the level of functionality you described but if it&#39;s really distressing to you then go for it!

Thank you  My boyfriend used to be a piercer and he tells me the same thing (he actually said
<em>
I&#39;ve seen many vaginas and none of them look the same and I&#39;ve seen many that look kinda like yours
</em>
lol) I really don&#39;t wanna go for surgery tbh I just wish I had a bit longer vulva and that&#39;s it. ðŸ˜ª

The raphe line does stand out following first stage work. I&#39;m told they can&#39;t do much with it on the first pass because of the dilation regimen.

It is ultimately up to you, and if you are happy with the functionality then I wouldn&#39;t urge you to make a decision either way. If your goal is to get as close to a natal vulva as possible, it is a very short vulva and you could possibly get vulvaplasty to shorten your perineum as much as possible. However, not everyone&#39;s goal will be to have natal-appearing genitals, and if you are happy with how it looks then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the risks associated with an additional surgery. But if the appearance makes you dysphoric then it can definitely be worth having a consult with another surgeon to see if they can help you.

I like my position I just want a slightly bigger vulva. But there are revision surgeries for vulva and labia to match the aesthetic you are looking for

It doesn&#39;t look amazing but it also doesn&#39;t look abnormal. If it&#39;s functioning fine I&#39;d move on and be done with it, no need for more expense, pain, and risk of complications.

Iâ€™m going with the others. You look lovely. Everyone is different thatâ€™s true. But you look lovely. And since you have good depth and sensation, I wouldnâ€™t want to risk that on a revision.
