I&#39;m now seriously considering them. The only thing I&#39;m worried about are complications after the fact. Has anyone had issues with healing/needed more care afterwards?
</p>
<p>
If so, how have you managed? Did you go back to Thailand? Did you go to a doctor in your home country (I&#39;m in the US)? Is it difficult to work with a US doctor after surgery abroad? I&#39;m kind of afraid they would deny me service for some reason.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also considered maybe just staying in Thailand for most of initial recovery (like 2 months)? Did anyone do that?
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I just want to thank all of you for sharing your experiences. I keep getting updates from girls responding, and all of your insights are incredibly helpful. Just, this community, it&#39;s just amazing.

The 30 day stay is a good opportunity for any major issues to be caught. That said, it is about 3 months to feel mostly normal again. I was still in a lot of pain when I left at 30 days. Staying 2-3 months isn&#39;t a bad idea if you can swing it. You will go stir-crazy though lol.

In addition to the apartments, there&#39;s another hotel nearby (Rattanachol) that was recently renovated and might be less janky for a long-term stay, it apparently has discount rates for Suporn patients. I didn&#39;t mind the Chon Inter too much but it&#39;s definitely a very odd place.

Chon inter was kinda weird, but I loved it. It&#39;s clean and everyone is super nice, and it&#39;s cheap. Idk, I though the room service food was ok at times, but overall I&#39;d stay there again without a second thought for another month.

Not sure, I just heard it secondhand and didn&#39;t inquire much as to the details. If I remember correctly, they were competitive with the Chon.

I stayed for 28 days and had no complications. I even went to the mall in Chon buri a bunch of times post op. If you have complications when you get home, you can email, and get some dodgy info to give to a local doctor, but they also have other ways to communicate with other patients and get solid advice. If they let you go home you will most likely be in a good enough state to not need to see anyone for anything more than an infection.
</p>
<p>
Mostly you&#39;re just going to bleed while dilating and moving around, as long as you&#39;re not bleeding too much they tell you to just wait it out and it goes away on its own. It&#39;s really not as scary as some people are describing for most people.
</p>
<p>
I knew a woman with a lot of complications who had to have a few revisions while there and she stayed an extra week and a half and then went home and has been fine, just bleeding same as the rest of us.

I did my surgery in Arizona and I did experience immediate complications afterwards. And I live in New York. I ended having to go to the ER and do all my follow up work in New York. Its hard when your doctor is far away. So that is why I think its important to find a local doctor where you live because traveling can get really expensive and on top of that you have to also be financially ready medically if complications happen. Insurance did cover my initial surgery but also consider financially post-op complications. It does happen. I just want you to be fully prepared if things don&#39;t go the way you expected it to go.
</p>
<p>
Looking back I wished that I  would of enjoyed the process and journey  of  my transition. Had taken  more time on making that surgical  decision,  spoken to more individuals who had  undergone the surgery and  really did my  research. I went into it blind   and didn’t ask nearly  as many questions  as I should have. Best of luck  moving forward with your surgery.

Take your time girl and make sure you do the research. No need to rush into it  so quickly.  SRS is major reconstruction. There are risks,  complications and major after care  involved post op. Post-op depression is also very common after SRS. Truthfully, I was  indifferent about getting the surgery.   But I did it because I was tired  of people asking me if I had the surgery and I didn&#39;t want people to  question who I am as a person. Getting the surgery just validated me as a full woman. But, at the same time there were some cons too. My sex drive  was non-existent, there is a  lot of maintenance and upkeep with a  vagina, prone to getting a UTI   because the urethra is shorter and the most part  I miss is how  effortlessly going to the bathroom was. Always remember, its nobody&#39;s business what&#39;s between your legs.

Thanks. I appreciate the advice. I just have wanted it for a very long time (at least what comes after the recovery). It&#39;s less about what other people think and more about what I want. It also doesn&#39;t help that most surgeons have like a 2 year waitlist or something (sometimes just for consultation), so it will take time to get there even if I&#39;m ready.

What kind of complications do you worry about?
</p>
<p>
Some very few do have problems with the healing of the skin graft and do require a revision sooner than the 12 months.
</p>
<p>
I stayed 30 days and it was ok but I would recommend 6 weeks just to feel a bit safer when you have to go home :)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If so, how have you managed? Did you go back to Thailand? Did you go to a doctor in your home country (I&#39;m in the US)? Is it difficult to work with a US doctor after surgery abroad? I&#39;m kind of afraid they would deny me service for some reason.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am 3.5 months post op. So far I have not seen any other doctor. If I suspect an infection I will see a doctor about that. I would not want any other surgeon to fix anything except in an emergency or a secondary colon surgery if my skin graft fails me. I I get a healing complication I will fly to Thailand. I am planning to go for the free revision  (12-18 months post op) and hope I will not need to go sooner. I am happy with my result so far but with the revision a few thinks can be improved that they will not do initially.
</p>
<p>
I mostly enjoyed my stay in Thailand and would not want to treat that for a surgery at home. I loved the company of the other girls and the Hospital was also superb. I really look forward to go there again except the fact that a minor revision is more painful because of being awake lol.
</p>
<p>
You should know that with Suporn/Bank healing usually takes way more time and dilation is (a lot) )harder (at first) than with penile inversion. This is because he tries to give you a lot of depth (I got 18cm) and also does way more on the outside like putting erectile skin on the inner labia. Most other surgeons focus more on a fast healing.

You could find a good gynecologist to take care of you afterwards.
</p>
<p>
People ask me all the time if I have a local surgeon to take over but I would not want that. They would no nothing about the technique or how to fix things.
</p>
<p>
Most complications happen while in Thailand and get fixed there if necessary.

I know one person who’s had serious issues (she’s going back for early revision). The email support is abysmal. It feels awful to talk to them and they just don’t really ... say or seem to know much. That said, I haven’t had many issues myself. Some small scares (I bled in the flight home, and pooped a quarter cup of blood two months in after straining a bit too much) but it didn’t amount to anything. I regret going there for surgery but only a little (my result has been good). I’ll just say, after a month if you’re staying in the hotel you will 100% want to get out (it’s bad).
</p>
<p>
They will heavily recommend not seeing a doctor in the US and will warn against it.

I don’t think the long recovery time and general strategy is warranted, basically. I just wanted as little complication as possible. I tried to play some strenuous VR at 6 months and the whole area started to turn red, lol. I hope it fully heals up by a year but I just question the wisdom of the approach.
</p>
<p>
I also saw a few others have complications that were not really looked after properly, which was really worrying.
</p>
<p>
<em>

</em>
also, having to fly back to Thailand for any issues and only having a few people in the world who can fix problems is extremely worrisome, especially with the state of their email support

surgery itself is still pretty triggering topic for me but regarding thailand... after 5 weeks there (1 week before the surgery and 4 after) staying in a shitty hotel, eating shitty food and not being be able to go outside even during the last week (almost +40 and terrible pollution, just nothing to breathe) we wanted to go back home sooo badly that even 13 hours flight at economic class didn’t seem so scary.

Join the Suporn facebook group, and maybe the unaffiliated general trans surgery group you can find in FB search, if you want access to more first-hand experiences. For example, someone who was there for GRS when I went for my revision had a super-challenging healing process and documented it on those groups. As other comments here suggest, the post-op email support she received was very lacking.

Thanks for asking this and all the advice.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had similar thoughts and concerns. I had the idea to stay longer than a month, but from what I hear dilation gets more difficult in months 2 or 3 or sometimes sooner or later for some, so surely you wouldn’t want to be travelling during this phase as you’d miss at least one dilation, right? Then it sounds pretty boring to stay in Chon Buri for 3 months but if I went somewhere else in Thailand I know I’d get lonely. So maybe if I got as long a visa as possible and a flexible plane ticket home and just extended my stay if I was having complications or felt like staying?
</p>
<p>
From what I’ve read it sounds as if they’d bring you back and take care of you for a bad rare complication, like those 2 fistulae cases, but now I’m worried about something less serious but still bad enough to merit medical care. Surely they wouldn’t oppose a local doc taking care of granulation, or BV say?
</p>
<p>
Personally I can accept the possibility of complications if there’s a clear way to get help for them and a decent chance of recovery in the end.

Thanks so much for your reply. Sheesh it&#39;s not wordy at all, I&#39;d say thorough and concise. This is just the info I needed. I&#39;m so sorry you were so bored and lonely at home, that sounds awful. I don&#39;t have a lot of close local friends so I&#39;m a little concerned about that.
</p>
<p>
I find I&#39;m mostly excited, with some lingering, healthy fear. I&#39;m trying to listen to my fear and sooth it by preparing mentally and practically for complications. It sounds like some flexibility in the return date might be good to have. I&#39;m lucky though I don&#39;t have to rush back to work and Australia&#39;s home so not such a long haul.

<p>
I&#39;ve heard of someone staying there a few months, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s common.
