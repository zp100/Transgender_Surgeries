Quick tidbit on how to select a surgeon (especially for GRS vaginoplasty): ask a variety of surgeons to show you a selection of their work (results photos). Have some geographic variety. One surgeon from your home country. One surgeon from Thailand, any other possibilities that are convenient for some reason, etc.. Next, evaluate the results photos for aesthetic style. Are they showing you what you want your vagina (or other body part for other surgeries) to look like? Don&#39;t check for botched results in the pictures - do a search for the surgeon here and other places for that. They&#39;re only going to send you examples of their average-to-good work. Check for aesthetic style. You can&#39;t really request a particular aesthetic style from a surgeon, they&#39;re just going to do their best job in their standard style &amp; individual variance means you&#39;ll get something in the range of their capabilities. So you want to look at the overall aesthetic style of the results pictures doctors send you to figure out if their good results match what you want your vagina to look like.
</p>
<p>
In my case that was with Preecha Aesthetic Institute (PAI) in Thailand, with Dr. Sutin (apparently he does most of their foreign business). I very much liked their aesthetic style (other Thai surgeons too), much, much more than I liked what I saw from American surgeons (your tastes may vary). And of the three most famous clinics in Thailand, PAI was significantly cheaper. More on cost soon.
</p>
<p>
Note that I don&#39;t visit this forum much, so if there&#39;s some information I&#39;m forgetting to add or other tips to make my post more useful, let me know. Information/link-to-guide on how to add my post to the wiki (unless the moderators do that) would also be appreciated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
I contacted PAI after multiple failed attempts to get surgery covered by insurance here in the U.S. (including one case where it was a provider who rejected me as a patient - upset I wanted results photos &amp; didn&#39;t compliment them enough when they finally showed me some in-office so I didn&#39;t have access to the files). I think this worked out well for me in the end, because of how happy I was with my experience with PAI.
</p>
<p>
I had previously ruled out Thai surgeons in general because of cost. I&#39;d heard costs in the 20k range, unless one went with a &#34;disreputable&#34; (someone else&#39;s evaluation) surgeon that did GRS vaginoplasty only rarely. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. When I looked at Thailand again, I ran into some conflicting information on the top/most reputable providers. But the names I saw most often (including on this subreddit&#39;s very valuable wiki) were Suporn clinic, Chettawut clinic, and Preecha Aesthetic Institute. The cost estimates for Suporn &amp; Chettawut clinic were indeed in the 20k range. But PAI charged 10k (perhaps because that&#39;s the maximum amount of cash the U.S. allows on flights, heh). When I asked around (particularly the wiki here &amp; my doctor) I found PAI had a good reputation as a Thai clinic, even if I hadn&#39;t heard about them as much as Suporn or Chettawut. And their results photos looked pretty decent to me.
</p>
<p>
Cost breakdown for my surgery: 10k to PAI, probably 3.5k to hair removal beforehand, 2k for a round trip flight - business class for the long leg on the way back &amp; coach for the rest, 500-750 for hotel, lodging, therapist letters, incidentals, etc., maybe 16k overall.
</p>
<p>
PAI&#39;s clinic has customer-facing staff with workable English. Nearly fluent, really, but hiccups and amusing word choices were present. I was a little uncomfortable with the office staff talking to me (well, e-mailing me), as I thought they were male at first. Nope. One is non-binary (I think), and the other is a trans woman who hasn&#39;t start hormones as they don&#39;t want to piss off their family. That made me a lot more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Adding to the confusion, honorifics in Thai are gendered according to the speaker, not the recipient. English says &#34;right this way ma&#39;am&#34; if the person being spoken to is a woman, regardless of the speaker&#39;s gender. Thai says &#34;right this way ma&#39;am&#34; if the person speaking is a woman, regardless of the gender of the person being spoken to.
</p>
<p>
I found out that PAI could schedule a surgery date as little as a few months out (no real waiting list). This was good, as I was nearly done with hair removal. (Though I do wish I&#39;d done more than was strictly necessary, particularly below the scrotum.) In fact, I ended up scheduling about 5 months out from when I contacted them for my own reasons unrelated to surgery.
</p>
<p>
Flying to Thailand was very complicated, due to COVID restrictions &amp; regulations. Lots of paperwork. Though even with that said, the most time-consuming aspect of preparation was getting my passport. Budget months for that to happen. The U.S. state department is not fast in such matters.
</p>
<p>
I purchased a plane ticket a few months out for about $1000 round-trip, which was probably about as cheap as I could have gotten it, given my starting city in the U.S.. I ended up sending another $1000 to upgrade one leg (the long leg) of the return trip to business class. (Which on international flights is the front-of-the-plane serious luxury complimentary-champagne and lie-down seat accommodations.) This was very useful to not be in pain on the way back. Not for the champagne.
</p>
<p>
COVID difficulties abounded. Changes to flight schedule that had to be watched. Quarantine hotel in Thailand, testing before flying, etc., etc..
</p>
<p>
Once in Thailand (I spent a month there), two weeks were eaten up by a quarantine hotel, which sucked. A normal schedule would also be a month, but with 5-7 days for tourist activities/preliminary appointments with the clinic &amp; more recovery time before flying home.
</p>
<p>
Because of losing those two weeks, I then had a whirlwind day of errands. Meeting with the Dr. at the clinic, handing over 10k in cash, pre-surgery COVID test at the hospital, a different hospital for Thai psychiatrist appointments (required by Thai law, foreign psychiatrists letters that I had aren&#39;t enough, but it was pro forma, easy, no big deal). Then one night in a non-quarantine hotel before surgery the next day!
</p>
<p>
At this point I want to pause for a bit to talk about how AMAZING private healthcare its outside of the U.S.. I mean, HOLY COW, it&#39;s incredible. Cheaper than paying out of pocket in the U.S. by far. Upfront pricing. Yes, you heard me. Upfront pricing. There were no significant unexpected charges during my trip (the biggest was probably about $50 to the two Thai psychiatrists, no more than $100 in unexpected costs - and even those PAI told me to expect before they took my money). It was, frankly, shocking as an American to be told the cost would be 10k (surgery room &amp; 5-day hospital stay included) and to have the cost be 10k. There could have been additional hospital fees if I had complications, but I did not. And, again, I don&#39;t think those would have been too much.
</p>
<p>
And more than cost, and honest upfront pricing, there was the service. The clinic helped with hotel reservations. They actively kept in touch with me to guide me through the process even before I got to Thailand. They sent a van/chauffeur to pick me up from the Quarantine hotel, take me to various errands on the errand day, take me to the hospital the next day, every visit to the clinic before &amp; after surgery, they even took me to the airport when I left Thailand after arranging the COVID test I needed to fly the previous day... the staff genuinely saw me as their responsibility and made sure things went smoothly. Without me having to ask (though I did pester them with questions, heh). Again, if you&#39;re an American used to &#34;we do this job and this job only - you figure out everything else and all the logistics on your own,&#34; it&#39;s a freaking revelation. (Note, this is also how private medicine in Mexico has been explained to me by an aunt who goes there for cancer treatments - it&#39;s not just Thailand.)
</p>
<p>
And while my U.S. insurance was no good in Thailand, I&#39;m not so sure the costs would have been much less covered by insurance in the U.S.. Hair removal costs (3.5k) + maximum out-of-pocket costs for the year (7k) + unexpected charges, domestic travel, and incidentals? Those unexpected charges, things surprisingly not covered... I don&#39;t think I would have saved that much. There was none of that with PAI (and probably other Thai or European providers).
</p>
<p>
On the day of surgery I checked into one of Bangkok&#39;s private hospitals (Prayathai). Private meaning for-profit, and not serving those using Thailand&#39;s public healthcare. It was immediately apparent that Thailand is a healthcare destination for many purposes, as the menu in the hospital room was not just in English, but also Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic. (Also with a lot of Indian food, but they expected people from India to speak English I guess). That impressed me right away as they were obviously accommodating upper middle-class or wealthy people from other countries coming to Thailand for top-quality healthcare. Throughout the process all the patient-facing staff spoke technically fluent but-not-really-fully-conversationally-fluent English. Good enough!
</p>
<p>
After I got situated, the hospital nurse (with a long history of working with PAI patients) showed up, and gave me a laxative enema in preparation for surgery. Which did not turn out to be as horrible as drinking laxative alone at the hotel the previous night (also part of surgery prep). Then some orderlies wheeled me off to the surgery suite, I chatted with some nurses prepping everything &amp; putting on good music, the anesthesiologist came in (incredible looking short woman), asked a few questions, I closed my eyes as I counted to 10 and I woke up without a dick.
</p>
<p>
For the next five days I recovered in the hospital room. I had pain, but not too much of it. In fact, I&#39;d requested before the surgery to not be given morphine (I&#39;m terrified of being addicted), but when I woke up they&#39;d already given me a morphine drip (sigh). I communicated with the nurses asking them to turn it down/not have the morphine. They were actually quite confused, as I don&#39;t think they get many patients asking for LESS painkillers/opiods. To the extent they confirmed with me three times that I wanted less. The nurses eventually suggested dialing back minimum-strength drip until the sole bag they&#39;d already hooked up ran out. Sounded good to me. That was about 18 hours after I woke up... I think. For the rest of recovery I used nothing but paracetemol (acetominophen/Tylenol). Much less painful than expected. Your results may vary.
</p>
<p>
Most of my time was spent laying on my back, reading, sleeping (a lot), and laying on my side being disgruntled when the nurses told me I had to because I&#39;d develop bed sores on my ass (which was getting red and inflamed). Also eating. Meals were the big highlight, and were fantastic. Oddly enough, the western/foreign menu was much better quality than the Thai menu. The mashed potatoes (not usually something I like much) were amazingly good.
</p>
<p>
I had on this big wrap around my hips, upper legs, and groin. This held in place the catheter, blood catheter (holy #$*@ hardcore), vaginal packing, and everything. There was a gap in the back where I could poop if I needed to. I didn&#39;t need to - the laxatives did their job. I found out later that infection, especially from discharge from the rectum, is the biggest complication worry when recovering from vaginoplasty. The wrap used by PAI, especially with the ability to poop if needed, sounded better thought out &amp; more functional than what I&#39;d heard about from stories of American surgeons. That said, complications are possible with any surgeon &amp; you may not be as fortunate as I in avoiding them. But Dr. Sutin did do a great job, and I faced no significant complications.
</p>
<p>
Three days into my hospital stay, I was encouraged to &#34;train&#34; the bladder by holding back before releasing into the catheter. The catheter and blood catheter, including jagged crystallized blood where it went into my lower torso (hardcore!) were removed on the fifth day, along with the wrap and the vaginal packing. I demonstrated both the ability to pee and a lack of incontinence (I still wouldn&#39;t need to poop for a few more days), was therefore cleared to go to the recovery hotel without having the catheter put back on (oh thank goodness). And off I went to the recovery hotel. Which is just a hotel.
</p>
<p>
I had arranged for the junior suite by the way instead of the cheapest room. It was like $5 more a night and well worth it.
</p>
<p>
After a night&#39;s sleep, I was chauffeured to the PAI clinic the next day. With the vaginal packing out, it was time to learn to dilate.
</p>
<p>
This did not go as well. While I got the predicted 6 inches of depth from surgery and the Dr./nurses helped insert the dilator, it went very slowly due to sensitivity, discomfort, and some pain. Surprising the staff. It also took me a long time (and another appointment to review dilation &amp; reassure me after I admitted I just wasn&#39;t managing to fully dilate on my own) to figure out a position &amp; process that would allow me to fully insert the dilator. It was pretty rough.
</p>
<p>
In the recovery hotel I watched TV, read, surfed the internet on occasion, slept (a lot), and again meals were the highlight of the day. An excellent hotel breakfast in the morning and then lunch and dinner (or just one bigger meal later) delivered by Grab (Thaliand&#39;s all-purpose delivery/uber/food delivery service with a decent English app). Because of COVID all the restaurants were closed. Like most other things, the food cost was about 1/3rd what one would pay in the U.S.. And the food was quite good. I even tried the Bangkok Taco Bell at the urging of PAI staff. It was high quality with fresh ingredients. Seemed wrong somehow.
</p>
<p>
Recovery really wasn&#39;t all that fun. In particular I had to walk very slowly all the time as a safety measure against pulling internal sutures. But eventually, after my return to the U.S., that ended.
</p>
<p>
Due to the shortened trips schedule (COVID) I left Thailand without as much recovery time as Dr. Sutin would have liked. Thankfully my Dr. back in the U.S. is quite experienced with trans patients and had managed many surgery recoveries before, so I wasn&#39;t too worried. PAI chauffeured me to the airport, and I flew home (breaking my no-alcohol/no-caffiene rule to facilitate recovery to enjoy a glass of champagne in the fancy seats on the long leg when flying back). Paying an additional $1000 to upgrade to business class on the long leg of the flight back hurt my cheapskate soul, but was well worth it for the ability to lay down. After surgery, laying down is best, standing is okay, sitting is not very fun. Even with the donut pillow. Wheelchair service was available in all the airports (and necessary).
</p>
<p>
Once back home, I continued to walk slowly, dilate frequently and with some discomfort, and things slowly got better. There were a few wound-healing touch-ups done by my Dr., but those are common and, again, I had essentially no complications. I didn&#39;t end up losing depth as a result of difficult dilations, and made it back to 6 inches of depth with some difficulty. PAI remained available to contact if I had questions. And they checked up on me to see how recover was going.
</p>
<p>
After about 3 months I could engage in normal activity as usual. After about 6 months I felt confident in trying vaginal sex.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s fun, by the way. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to orgasm from just vaginal sex - but I can orgasm. Everything works.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m about 8 months out now, dilation is down to once-a-day (with some skipped days). The quick picture I added (failed to add - I&#39;ll have to figure that out in the future) is from today. I didn&#39;t spend time making everything look good (as you can see from the lint in my pubic hair). It&#39;s just my vagina on a normal day. Notable (to me) are the inner labia (the outer labia are laying pretty flat in the picture - the scars run along them), larger and much more prominent than I saw on American results pictures. I&#39;m very happy with the aesthetics &amp; results.
</p>
<p>
Thanks PAI! Please leave any questions/comments below. And let me know what I should add/edit, as I wrote all this in one big chaotic go.

As another PAI girl that also went with Sutin I can only 100% agree with your post. Made the exact same experience down to a T and your post definitely gave me a good flashback :&#39;) 4 months post op now and couldn&#39;t love it any more.
</p>

They&#39;re absolutely fantastic

Hi thank you very much for sharing your experience with PAI and more specifically with Dr. Sutin, he is on my short list short list of SRS surgeons and honestly made me feel more confident about going with him, I have some questions about your experience: How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? You had the circumcision before the surgery? You asked Dr. Sutin to have prominent labia minora? (I would like to have an aesthetic like the one you describe in your post, and I hope you can fix the problem with the photo, there are not many SRS results from Dr. Sutin here and it would be very helpful for the people who plan to go with him), What technique did you have? (penile skin inversion, penile skin inversion with scrotal skin graft, sigmoid colon or the peritoneal technique), How are your dilators? Did you buy the dilators that appear on their page? (
<a href="https://pai.co.th/dilator-grs/">https://pai.co.th/dilator-grs/
</a>
), How is the process of dilations? They are painful? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if so.. What would you improve your result with one? That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

<p>
I very much like the aesthetics. The benefits over American surgeons to me are a more developed vulva, particularly inner labia. Your aesthetic preferences may vary. I did NOT ask Sutin for prominent labia minora (and I wouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re super prominent, just there as I&#39;d want them to be rather than practically absent as I&#39;ve seen with other surgeons). Again, I don&#39;t think with surgeons you can really ask for a particular style. (It would be too hard for them given the already large individual variation of patient and procedure.) That&#39;s why I advocate picking surgeons based on the general style of their results - because I don&#39;t think the surgeons are really capable of altering their aesthetic style much.
</p>
<p>
Sensitivity: fine. My clitoris is a little too sensitive, but I&#39;ll definitely take that over nerve damage. As mentioned in the post, I can orgasm. I did have circumcision before surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had penile skin inversion with scrotal skin graft. I&#39;m not sure how much scrotal skin he used. Scrotal tissue is used if there&#39;s not enough skin from the shaft of the penis to form the vaginal walls. Probably some. Penile skin with or without scrotum is the standard technique, as my research showed me. The colon or peritoneal techniques are mostly used for revising a botched penile skin inversion surgery. Penile skin surgeries can be revised with the other techniques relatively easily. The other techniques are a lot harder to revise. That plus overall less downsides to penile skin surgeries make them the standard.
</p>
<p>
Dilators are fine. I got both the standard ones &amp; an extra optional set they sell fro $100 (not actually the set on the page - their website is probably out of date). Then I later bought some dilators aimed at cis women (not long enough, so I had to use one of those and a smaller one from PAI), not because they were strictly necessary, but because it is less uncomfortable and painful to slowly go up sizes rather than jump up. So I bought the optional dilators mostly to see which ones felt better/less bad. I ended up deciding that was irrelevant, just slap a condom on them and go, they&#39;re all hard as a rock. But I ended up being happy to have several because of the many-small-steps aspect of increasing size.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is pretty simple. You take a device that&#39;s basically a dildo but rock-hard (seriously, no give at all). And you put it up your vagina. This hurts, because your vagina is healing &amp; injured as you start and the dilator is big for you (so it can stretch you) and rock hard. You just have to go very slowly. The goal is to bottom out and keep pressure on the dilator in you for 20 minutes (and insertion can take even longer early on, that 20 minutes is after insertion). This stretching breaks up scar tissue formation in the vagina, which prevents that scar tissue from making the vaginal walls rigid &amp; costing you depth. Also, dilation will happen with any surgeon. As far as I can tell, it&#39;s no different other than the dilators being given/sold to you. It gets less painful, less time consuming, and you have to do it less often over time. Now it&#39;s a mild annoyance/chore on par with sweeping the floor, eventually it&#39;ll be down to once a week (and take about 20 minutes). Again, basically the same for every surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I would not have revision surgery. I&#39;m extremely happy with my results and I wouldn&#39;t want anyone revising what I&#39;ve got! The one thing I&#39;d change is more hair removal than I got, particularly below the scrotum. I don&#39;t have a problem with hair in the vagina (thank you hair removal), but I&#39;d like less hair around the vaginal opening. But this is not a surgery problem &amp; it doesn&#39;t make me dysphoric. Just a normal woman vanity thing. But hair removal takes forever and electrolysis is expensive and painful, so I did just what was necessary. Not a big deal.

<p>
Thank you! It was absolutely worth it. Significantly less dysphoria and more euphoria. It just took every day and took away some of the &#34;argh!&#34; while adding more &#34;woo-hoo!&#34; So, so worth it for just dysphoria reduction. Vaginal sex is just a side benefit.

Thank you so much for sharing your experience! May I ask how many days there were in total between your surgery and your return flight? I&#39;d have to travel to a smaller airport to get home, and worry about plane changes and the last leg of the flight in a smaller plane.

For me, there was a total of 14 days (I had surgery on the 17th and flew out on the 31st). 5 in the hospital, 9 in a hotel. However, Thailand has since cut quarantine down to one day for fully-vaccinated travelers (you get tested the day you get in and are released the next day if your COVID test doesn&#39;t come back positive). So you could probably add a week+ to recovery time and stay in Thailand for a month.

I did travel on smaller legs, and have some layovers in airports when I was in a wheelchair. It wasn&#39;t fun, but it was okay. I wasn&#39;t on a prop plane, but I was on a small Skywest commuter jet for the last leg. It was alright. It&#39;s not really the size of the seat/legroom that&#39;s an issue. It&#39;s more being able to lie down once in awhile (which I also did not have on the domestic leg).

Like many countries, Thailand has measures in place to try to reduce the number of COVID-positive travelers coming into their country. A bit late for that... but that&#39;s another story.
</p>
<p>
What this means is that if you fly into Thailand you must book with a government-approved quarantine hotel (there should be plenty to choose from). Currently, you will stay there one night after you arrive, so you can be tested before being allowed to travel in the country as well. If you test negative, you can go do whatever. If you test positive, then you have to wait until you are no longer contagious before being allowed to leave the quarantine hotel. The quarantine hotels are each associated with a hospital in the city, so if you get very sick, you will receive care.
</p>
<p>
When you fly, have a good mask and wear it constantly (I used KF94 masks, they&#39;re reasonably comfy and a high degree of safety). Between a negative test before you leave (I got two done, just in case) and a good mask, your risk of testing positive in Thailand is extremely low.
</p>
<p>
When you arrive at the airport, government health officials will check your paperwork. Then you&#39;ll go through the customs procedures standard for entering any country regardless of COVID. Then you will be handed over to a driver from the quarantine hotel. They&#39;ll take you to the hotel and your room. So you&#39;re always under supervision until you leave the quarantine hotel.
</p>
<p>
You need to look at the latest instructions from the Thai embassy in your country. This is just one of those work-through-the-bureaucracy moments. You can&#39;t get around it. And I can&#39;t tell you for sure how it works, as the rules change from time to time (for example, all travelers to Bangkok had to quarantine for two weeks when I went, no exceptions for testing negative). Here&#39;s the relevant page from the Thai Embassy in Washington D.C. :
<a href="https://thaiembdc.org/th/2022/02/27/entryschemetestandgomarch1/" rel="nofollow">https://thaiembdc.org/th/2022/02/27/entryschemetestandgomarch1/
</a>
</p>
<p>
Following the instructions above, you do most of your paperwork before you go. See here:
<a href="https://tp.consular.go.th/home" rel="nofollow">https://tp.consular.go.th/home
</a>
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll need travel insurance that meets Thai government requirements from whatever company you wish. For example, currently that looks like this:
<a href="https://misterprakan.com/en/pass/thailand-pass" rel="nofollow">https://misterprakan.com/en/pass/thailand-pass
</a>
</p>
<p>
Note that you don&#39;t need to apply for a visa if you are from a major Western country (you are a tourist exemption, not a medical visa candidate). Please note that applying for a passport from your country is the longest part of the process, if you have not already done that.
</p>
<p>
And most importantly, remember the rules change. If you leave in four months, the requirments for entry may have changed some what. Get your passport first. Arrange dates with PAI second. Get your plane tickets 6-8 weeks before you leave. 3-ish weeks before you leave check the Thai embassy for the current rules and start doing the paperwork/arranging hotels, getting travel insurance, etc.. Update PAI as you complete various steps (plane tickets purchased, Thailand Pass paperwork completed, quarantine hotel booked, arrival in Thailand).

Thank you SO much, I thankfully have a passport and everything. I just didn’t understand the quarantine hotel thing as I’m bringing my mum with me. But we’re both going to have travel insurance and everything sorted. I think I understand it all now. Thank you. Xx

You&#39;re welcome. I hope your recovery goes smoothly. Say hi to Bune for me (she&#39;s a sweet trans girl, but isn&#39;t transitioning due to her family).

PAI works with a hotel down the street from them. And who are therefore somewhat familiar with trans patients and won&#39;t be surprised when you&#39;re hobbling around and looking injured after surgery. I booked that hotel through PAI for the night before &amp; 9 days after the hospital. You don&#39;t have to book through PAI, but I recommend it. The hotel is a residence hotel, it has a lot of long-time residents and an excellent breakfast. I recommend a junior suite. Not much more expensive than their smaller rooms, which are very small.

When I went, PAI was only working with one hotel (COVID slowdown?). The other one is probably fine too. The one I went to was  The Residence on Thonglor Road:

Thank you for sharing your experience in this clinic🙏 During the procedure, did the surgeon use testicular tunica in order to make mucosa like tissue inside of the vagina ?

I do not know. You would have to ask PAI if that is part of their procedure. Sorry.

I think there was a $100 consultation or reservation fee. Something like that. Nothing too onerous.
