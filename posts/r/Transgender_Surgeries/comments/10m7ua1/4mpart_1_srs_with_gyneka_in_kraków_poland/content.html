There&#39;s not much information available publicly, so I decided to share my experience as I go.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been trying to save money for SRS with Chett since 2017. I lost my job in 2018, then brexit happened (which forced me to return to my home country) and right after that, COVID, during which all my savings went down the drain because I didn&#39;t have a job.
</p>
<p>
Things started to go back to normal in 2021 when I had found a new job. Started career, rented a flat, paid my debts and started saving once again. Recently got a big raise so I started doing some serious research about SRS in 2023.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had a look at the results of colonvaginoplasty performed at Gyneka. It looked shockingly good, so I sent two emails - one to Chett&#39;s WIH, and another to Gyneka.
</p>
<p>
Despite clearly explaining my situation (born with intersex condition, had gonads removed a while ago, want zero-depth because of faster recovery and (lack) of sexual orientation), Chett&#39;s response was just a generic copy-paste. They still do require two letters from psychiatrists and you still need to stay for a month in Thailand. Prices went up significantly, especially accommodation (Bangkok Rama Hotel is now twice as expensive). Back in 2020 it would cost 60k PLN, now it&#39;s 72k. All while putting my career on-hold because of a month spent in Thailand and requiring pointless, time-consuming tests beforehand. Yeah... nah.
</p>
<p>
Gyneka took almost two weeks to respond to my initial email, but I consider it normal since I sent it right after new year&#39;s eve and they had to consult the surgeon about my situation. It took them half a day to respond to the second one so everything&#39;s fine.
</p>
<p>
They require a valid court order (name/gender marker change), pre-op consultation with surgeon in person and blood tests (glucose, hiv, hbs - I will know more details after the consultation). Cost? 38k PLN, nearly half of round-trip to Thailand. This includes 3 - 4 days of hospitalization and you can get sick note so you won&#39;t have to use your days off. You don&#39;t have to go trough hair removal on genital area either, so that&#39;s perfect.
</p>
<p>
Yet another thing that pushed me towards deciding on Gyneka was the fact that I live alone in old flat without an elevator. If I will need anything, I can ask my family or friends for help. This simply wouldn&#39;t be possible in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m going with Gyneka instead of Chett. I&#39;m well aware that I&#39;m taking a risk, but for that price and convenience I will gladly take it especially after seeing two results and talking to two people who went there. I don&#39;t expect anything special, just something that will look fairly natural and won&#39;t cause issues with urination (for the past 26 years of my life I&#39;ve been dealing with frequent UTIs due to my condition and I&#39;m sick of it).
</p>
<p>
While their waiting list isn&#39;t that long (about a month and a half), I can&#39;t afford it just yet. Should be able to around mid-May, which is a bit funny considering that I started HRT on May 18th 2016 (7 years... time flies, doesn&#39;t it?).
</p>
<p>
End of part 1, -4 months.

Do you have a link to this place and results?. Who is the surgeon?
</p>
<p>
I’ve found very little on Poland.

You have been shadow banned by reddit and no one can see your posts unless manually approved by moderators, which won&#39;t always happen. You need to get it fixed.

, Dr. Paweł Szymanowski.
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t link to results, because people I spoke to are very private about it (which is completely understandable).
