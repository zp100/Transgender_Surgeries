Does anyone have any information on PriyaMed&#39;s GRS technique? I&#39;d be extremely interested since I live in the US and all peritoneal surgeons I&#39;ve found are extremely expensive. I think peritoneal surgery is the best option for me, that being said I live in Texas (unless a miracle happens that gets me out of this shit hole) so insurance is more than likely not going to cover any GRS. But if I can find an affordable peritoneal surgeon that outside of the us that would solve my problem. Any information on Priyamed&#39;s GRS? I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s peritoneal but there&#39;s no information anywhere besides Facebook.

I&#39;ve found PriyaMed a very interesting case. I suspect the difference between what&#39;s on Facebook and elsewhere is due to some serious marketing. It&#39;s very difficult to do that kind of thing on reddit and very easy on Facebook.

I&#39;m sure they are for real, but personally I&#39;d be very cautious about relying on information from Facebook. Which leaves nothing much. And when they do start turning up elsewhere I&#39;d bear in mind that they probably do a lot of marketing.

I really hope this means peritoneal surgery will become more widespread. I mean, there&#39;s only a few surgeons doing it right now and it&#39;s really expensive. That being said it really does sound like the best option for trans women. I&#39;m not down for penile inversion when peritoneal exists lol.

They are for real.  I’m  booking with them for later this year.  I’ve talked to a few post OP patients, consulted with them, etc.

For real? Doooppppeeeee! Where can I find more info? I contacted Jane on Facebook but I haven&#39;t found a good time for a consult. Would they put me in contact with past patients? How would that work? Do you know where I can find some images of their results and some experiences without the consult?

They will more than likely not put you in contact with anyone who has had surgery.  They do have a YouTube site and you track people down that way.   The videos have some pictures of results not many.  Quite a few people are on Facebook, look for SRS and FFS groups.  Look for Sugar Swan she is the most open about it all.  They have pictures but only show them later in the consults.  They are working on a webpage right now and hope to have things up soon, you can google it.  I can help answer what I know and what I have learned talking to others.
