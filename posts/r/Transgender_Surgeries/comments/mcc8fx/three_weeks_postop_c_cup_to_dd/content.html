I always think I don&#39;t want big boobs, and then I see a picture like this.

Lol I know what you mean.  They honestly are no trouble at all, considering I got moderate plus. So itâ€™s a lot of volume and the rest was my natural breast tissue ðŸ˜¬

The back pain isn&#39;t worth it, imo. I&#39;m a transmasc person with natural F cups. The back pain is awful.

I&#39;m still trying to figure out if top surgery is right for me. I&#39;ve been doing some research and found a lot of conflicting information online.
</p>

Maybe I&#39;ll just get my bottom surgery first (an absolute must for me) and see if my boobs get any bigger from post-op HRT....

Honestly, take your time.
</p>
<p>
For me, I waited until I went through my second puberty and saw growth.  It worked out in that my doctor said I had plenty to work with.  Otherwise, they have to use tissue expanders and such.

For sure. Like I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to blindly rush into surgery. But I am around 22 months on HRT, so there is tissue there. But I&#39;ve also heard stories that trans women go through a second period of breast growth after having bottom surgery. So I think waiting to see what that second growth period entails might just be what I&#39;ll do. Because HRT has worked better than I&#39;d imagined in this regard. I just kind of wish they would have a better shape and we&#39;re just a tiny bit bigger. But there&#39;s enough there now that I don&#39;t get extremely dysphoric.

Oh yeah, youâ€™ll have plenty more periods of growth.  They come in spurts, at least they did for me. Glad things are working for you, HRT is both an art and a science. Keep on hanging there, I am sure things will get better and even out.

Who knew 2nd puberty was this crazy right?

Well in that case, I&#39;ll definitely give it some more time then. Might as well let second puberty run its course. And second puberty is a lot more fun than the first, might I add. Sure, I get emotional at times, but this time around it kind of feels like my body is doing what it should have done to begin with. And I think the HRT may have actually affected my personality a bit too, in a more positive way. (Or maybe I&#39;m just happier with myself.)
</p>
<p>
But I really do like the work your surgeon did though.

Ty! I am trying to find photos from before hormones.  But Iâ€™ll have to go to parents place - they have them all.  Iâ€™ll do another post update once I also get pre-surgery photos from surgeon.
