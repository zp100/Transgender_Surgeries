Well, what can I say at month 5?  I&#39;m still dilating once a day rather than twice a week, but I&#39;m using a dildo I bought instead of the dilators now. It&#39;s curved and suits my internal shape, and it&#39;s wider at the base but the same width at the top as my largest dilator.  I&#39;m quite happy with progress there and not nearly as sore as I was when I dropped to once a day before.  I haven&#39;t used a placeholder at all since my last post.
</p>
<p>
Everything seem to be quite settled down there. The stuff I talked about wanting done in my second surgery next month hasn&#39;t changed much - lumps at the top of the labia majora smoothed out, clitoris hood forming, the change in detail at the back of the entrance so it&#39;s not so tight etc., but I&#39;d add in having my pee coming out a little straighter if I could, it&#39;s still often still a bit everywhere. Orgasms can be a bit hit-and-miss, taking anywhere between 10 minutes and over an hour and/or giving up, I guess I just really need to be in the zone, but the journey&#39;s always fun even if I don&#39;t always reach the destination :-) Orgasm intensity is normally a bit lower now than it was before, I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s partly hormonal though, my hormones are all over the place at the moment, something I&#39;m working on with my endo.
</p>
<p>
The photos this time round are a bit different as I&#39;m not using the dilators now, so I thought I&#39;d show some different angles to what I&#39;ve done before instead.  The quality is a bit worse because I lost my camera I normally use and my phone is terrible :-(
</p>
<p>
Edit to add: this is probably the last post I&#39;ll do before my revision surgery, due at the end of next month.

Pee not coming out straight would actually be more ‚Äúcis seeming‚Äù. That‚Äôs the reason women can‚Äôt pee standing without a device. You can‚Äôt aim and it doesn‚Äôt come out as one stream or all in the same direction. Source: am afab

How is lubrication? What sort of waiting time did you have once you sent in the application?

Lubrication is ok but not amazing, sometimes it&#39;s enough for penetration, sometimes not - I suppose part of that is that most of the time I&#39;m dilating and that doesn&#39;t normally get me in the mood much!  So most times for dilation I need lube...
</p>
<p>
My application isn&#39;t representative because I had my operation during COVID and the waiting list was screwed up.  Happily for me, that meant it was short... a couple of months for the consultation, then 3 months between consultation and surgery, I think someone else on here managed 2 months!  I understand that the consultation-surgery gap is more than 6 months now though and have no idea what the lead-in for a consult is.

Looking great! How are the &#34;hygiene requirements&#34;? Do you need to douche? Is there discharge? Do you feel like the urethral mucosa helps establish the right kind of &#34;ecosystem&#34; down there?

I&#39;ve not douched at all for a couple of months now. Hygiene wise it&#39;s fine, occasionally I use an acidic wash but not often - maybe once a week or two - otherwise it&#39;s just normal showering.  I think the ecosystem is OK, I&#39;m not keen on the Estriol cream I get here (Ovestin), I much preferred the Estriol Wolff cream I got in Germany.  The Ovestin takes a relatively long time to absorb, which I think interferes with the ecosystem a bit.

Thank you so much for sharing! I looks great! I wanted to ask about the lumps. I‚Äôve seen them in some other Dr. Schaff‚Äôs results. What are they? Some suture ending? Does he do a good smoothing in the revision?

I&#39;d have a look at
<a href="/u/sonia_sadhbh" rel="nofollow">u/sonia_sadhbh
</a>
&#39;s posts to see what post-revision looks like.  Dr Schaff likes to preserve as much as possible in the first procedure and see what&#39;s where for the second once it&#39;s all calmed down.  That means the lumps are there to start, they feel a lot smoother than when I first had the surgery.
