the first 2 with padding were taken the first couple days. 20 and 21 were taken 1 week post op a couple hours after my cath was removed. 35 was taken a few days after that. 66-71 were taken 2 weeks post op. 52 and 53 were taken today (3 weeks and a little bit since gcs)

i think part of the reason that it’s healing so quickly is because i chose no-depth. less “trauma” in the area so it heals faster. i also just naturally heal a smidge faster than average. i even masturbated a bit last night (though despite the doc saying it was ok i was a smidge too vigorous and ended up bleeding a bit. you can see it as the dark red clump in the last pic)
</p>
<p>
if you don’t care about getting fucked, no-depth is a great choice IMHO

What was your reasoning for choosing zero depth? Looks great, thanks for sharing ! :)

not needing to dilate and a shorter recovery time were my major reasons. as much as i’d love depth, dilating seemed to emotionally and physically demanding for me post surgery. especially with a young kiddo, the amount of time i’d need to dedicate to that would make it harder to do. i might add depth later once i’m fully recovered but i’m not sure yet. i’d love to have depth but i don’t know if dealing with the long term realities of it is something i want.

I&#39;m just starting this process (also doing ZD) and I&#39;m strongly considering BMC because it&#39;s local.  How was the whole process for you?

honestly it’s a solid reason why i chose them. i just couldn’t feasibly do travel. i think they are shallow as fuck and you really gotta hound the nurses and stuff to make sure your case is moving forward. i found the staff mostly nice. oates and slama were fine doctors. i’m like 7 weeks out now? so i’m “fully healed” i still have a bit of swelling but not much. my clit is a little small for my liking. however, i can orgasm and it feels great. if you can deal with the wait, they are a really good local doctor pair. i’m very happy with mine.

I&#39;m aiming for spring 2023 and have just got their welcome packet, so I&#39;ll make sure to stay on top of them.  Thanks for the reply!

Hello and congrats!!! Slama and Oates are my first choice for a no-depth too. If you don’t mind I was just wondering, about how long of a wait you had between the first consultation and your surgery? Trying to get a sense of the wait time. Tysm!!!
