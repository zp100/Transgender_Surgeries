(Since reddit sucks and wouldn&#39;t add the image.NSFW)
</p>
<p>
I feel like the title sums it up.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
This is Joshua Roth and what he considered acceptable at followups.  I&#39;ve lost 98% of my depth (basically haze zero now), and I swell like a golfball when aroused because he left too much erectile tissue by far.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
It has killed my desire to have an intimate partner.
<br>
I had a revision to repair the clit hood, remove excess skin that he left at my entry, place some internal relief cuts on internal scars (didn&#39;t work), and a few other small fixes by Cleveland Clinic. (Dr Ferrando was amazing.)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not the only girl he has done this too. He responds in 100% the same way: Ignore ignore ignore, or outright lie and say you&#39;re the only one with these complications. Keep setting goals for what requires revision, but keep changing those goals. Dude barely ever internally or externally touched me to feel the inside scar tissue.
<br>
&#34;We will recheck at the next appointment and address it then.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t, by the way. They never address it. You&#39;ll give up first.
</p>
<p>
Do yourself a favor and avoid Dr. Gallagh- I mean, Dr. Roth.
</p>
<p>
(He used to work with her by the way. It makes sense now. IU health doesn&#39;t give a shit about us.)

I&#39;m so sorry that you had that experience. One of my friends has almost the exact same problems with him and has had to go to another surgeon out of state for revision.  Her sharing of those experiences convinced me to cancel my consult with his office and schedule with a surgeon in San Francisco.  He seems to be completely uncaring of patient needs and unwilling to address concerns about his work and that scared this shit out of me.  I hope you can find a different provider that can help.  All the love to you and if you ever need to talk with another Indy trans girl, my dms are open.üíöüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
