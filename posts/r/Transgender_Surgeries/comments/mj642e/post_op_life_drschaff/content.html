Hey!
</p>
<p>
I am currently approaching my srs op, and obviously the questions and fears are running wild in the head...
</p>
<p>
I wonder, to the ones that are post op - are you happy in general? Sexually - how do you feel you function? I am a straight transgender woman and I am wondering about PIV sex. Does it function well, and does it feel good? Do you actually get pleasure from penetrative sex?
</p>
<p>
I am having my operation with Dr. Schaff and if anyone else that had op with him would answer I would be happy, but I am grateful for answer from anyone that is post op!
</p>

Yes, yes and YES. Never happier. Sex is great, body image is wonderful, confidence is higher and clothes fit better! Absolutely no regrets whatsoever üòÅ

I had my first operation with Dr Schaff a month ago.  I&#39;m from the UK. Recovery in hospital was mostly fine and the staff are lovely, but when you go down to have your dressings changed for the first time, definitely take pain relief beforehand, as I found it incredibly sore!
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t speak much German. We got by, but not all the staff in the hospital speak English.
</p>
<p>
I stayed in the area for about a week after leaving the hospital.  Bear in mind that you won&#39;t be able to lift much at that point, and almost certainly not a heavy suitcase!  I got assistance at Berlin Brandenberg and Heathrow (I asked my airline).    If possible, have someone there to assist you!
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re not on German insurance (and possibly even if you are), I found German pharmacies to be very expensive indeed, I spend well over 100 ‚Ç¨ on things I needed in the relatively short term!  You&#39;ll likely need to see a gynaecologist or urologist fairly quickly after being discharged, I saw a Dr Hertwig in Berlin, and am awaiting seeing someone in the UK.
</p>
<p>
Dilation wise things are still a little tight yet on the dilators - it was a short time ago so that&#39;s to be expected, but I can use the biggest one if I work up to it. I got about 7&#34;/18cm depth.  I have also managed one orgasm, which is good going for so soon I think!
</p>
<p>
Do let me know if you&#39;d like to know anything else!

I am about a week from three months post-op and experienced a clitoral orgasm about 4 days ago. It takes some time for the nerves to settle down and reorient themselves after surgery. The hardest part is the patience waiting for the feeling to come back to the skin.  As for the orgasm itself, small circles, take your time, don&#39;t expect anything more than feeling pleasure. It eventually gets there. It&#39;s amazing!

Mine took 8 months üò≥
</p>
<p>
However I think I would have figure it out sooner had I figured it out (I cant do it on my own yet...  only works with my wife and I grinding our stuff together.
</p>
<p>
My orgasms, which I can consistently have when we try, are more intense and pleasurable than ever.
