I had FFS with him ~2.5 years ago and just recently had it revised by another surgeon. Would recommend against it. He&#39;s a fine plastic surgeon, but not for craniofacial work.
</p>
<p>
Wrt forehead, the issues were primarily that he did not touch my orbital rims or temporal ridges at all and attempted to perform a hairline advancement without undermining more than ~5cm back which stretched out the front of my scalp rather than actually advancing it significantly.
</p>
<p>
He was fine at rhinoplasty -- I need that revised as well, although not his fault, I&#39;m a complicated case -- and lip lift...had that revised just because of suture tracks in the scar, but again not really his fault.
</p>
<p>
Mandible and trachea shave he did quite badly, but you&#39;re not going for that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been meaning to upload a post-op CT from him, but tbh I don&#39;t care to smear the guy or anything. Just really recommend you see an actual craniofacial surgeon for craniofacial work.

Ok now I’m scared. Really he did not touch the orbital rims? Wtf. From what I saw here in the last couple of years he’s doing pretty good, has your ct scan confirmed he didn’t touched them? Ugh

I&#39;ve already had that entire area revised and my surgeon said he did not even undermine the skin that far down, just enough to reach the brow bossing. It&#39;s not surprising -- this is a recognized area of medicine there are fellowships in and professional societies for and which
<strong>
he does not specialize in.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The other problem with Cardenas is you can&#39;t really talk to him. He&#39;s basically non-verbal ime. That said, I wouldn&#39;t have known what questions to ask back then.

I have a similar problem with a visible railroad scar under my nose after a lip lift. How did you manage to fix it?

Revision. I also wanted more tooth show and had enough room to trim 3mm without resulting in an abnormally short philtrum. The new scar has no suture tracks, but I still don&#39;t have any tooth show since ultimately a subnasal lip lift isn&#39;t the right technique for that unless you sever the muscle which is generally a bad idea.

Well I guess I have to life with my scar than. It&#39;s already rather Short. But most people don&#39;t seem to notice even without concealer
