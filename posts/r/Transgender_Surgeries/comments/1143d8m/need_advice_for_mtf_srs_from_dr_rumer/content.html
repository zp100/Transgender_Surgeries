So yeah.. I got surgery from Dr. Rumer. I need some advice because I kinda feel overwhelmed and not really sure what to do. Like, I&#39;m trying to figure out whether I should go in for a revision and if so, who would be some better candidates out there for such a revision. Idk, I just wanna take good care of what I have, and I feel like I&#39;m failing at every turn.
</p>
<p>
So to explain things, I had hypergranulated skin which made it hard to dilate. They prescribed me Estrace cream which I&#39;ve been taking as per the instructions twice daily as well as recommended me to an Ob/gyn to apply silver nitrate on the hypergranulation. I was intimidated by that so I wanted to try some other treatment options first. I did research into medihoney and tried it out and I think it helped with the hypergranulation a bit because it no longer hurts to dilate, and it doesn&#39;t look as red. Though I&#39;m still bleeding on a regular basis, tho (tho it&#39;s not as bad).
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also this skin near the entrance that has like... A stiff texture and is white.
</p>
<p>
I can provide pictures if it helps.. I just.. think I&#39;m fucking everything up and I wanna cry... :&#39;/

Oh, hon, Rumer has a horrible reputation for M2F work around here. Revisions are a given, and I suggest finding another surgeon to do them. I&#39;d steer clear of Schecter in Chicago, too.

That’s unfortunate but I tend to think some of the complications I’ve seen related to Schechter were patient error. He is a perfectionist. My neovagina is “Barbie” in my opinion. My scaring minimal. I too experience a labia tear/wound dehiscence but the studies show this occurs in roughly 60% of GCS patients. The reviews I’ve seen on Schechter show he has poor bedside manner, and he isn awkward, but the way my v surgery has healed and progressed it’s hard to think he was doing this wrong. I have one close friend who had surgery with him with no issues and told a of individuals I’ve met through visits to his clinic that are quite happy. I truly recommend him and his team because his PT is one of the best people I’ve ever met. She will connect with you any time. I’ve called her at 11 pm with concerns and she doesn’t care. That and my outcome is what I base the whole experience on. Also he’s moved his practice to rush. I think there is very good chance they are making sure his outcomes are good

Dr Bluebond in NYC is often suggested for revisions on Rumer patients. Sorry that you crossed paths with Rumer.

Thank you all for the kind words. I&#39;ll have to be paying out of pocket for the revision cuz I&#39;m like 99% positive I won&#39;t be able to convince my insurance to help cover it. I&#39;m also not sure of the recovery of a revision but my job probably wouldn&#39;t let me have the time off either for this. They&#39;re kinda strict about time off.
</p>
<p>
I wonder, is this a &#34;must act fast&#34; situation?

No, particularly no surgeon will likely operate till you are at least 6 months post op the original surgery.

Yeah, they&#39;d want everything to &#34;settle down&#34;, then evaluate.

Also Ting and RBL prescribe Clobetasol ointment for granulation to use once a day at night for a few months. Basically coat your vaginal canal with a little of it after your last dilation at night. It works.

I really can’t stress it enough to do research on your surgeon of choice for this life changing surgery, Rumer should never be an option. Nobody should have to endure what she has put patients through, there’s plenty of information on here about Rumer. I really hope you find a great surgeon to help for a revision, and sorry you’re going through this.

Dr. Stiller in Spokane fixed me after some less than ideal surgery, though mine wasn’t “botched” just had some cosmetic issues and excess erectile tissue. I can highly recommend him.
