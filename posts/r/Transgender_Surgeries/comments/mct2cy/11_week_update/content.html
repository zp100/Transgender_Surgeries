So, I over did some things, and may have torn the fistula back open. Got a gyn appointment tomorrow to look at it. If it has, I&#39;ll be revisiting the doc. I have been bending and lifting again, putting away groceries etc. And it seems like that may have done it. When your surgeon says take it easy... listen. And emphasize to people that you need help. Possibly one of the O moments I&#39;m about to talk about could have contributed.
</p>
<p>
In brighter news, I&#39;ve now had 3 total orgasms. My clit keeps seeming to get more sensitive, and I had a piece of the calloused tissue actually rub off in the shower. It seems to be peaking though, so that&#39;s good. I haven&#39;t been consciously seeking orgasm yet. But I&#39;ve woken up twice to really strong ones, and had one in the shower after 2 months without one.
</p>
<p>
She seems to be healing ok... the red is starting to sting but it&#39;s fading. The area on my thigh is shrinking and the scars are getting lighter. I can dilate fairly easily, but it&#39;s gotten tight again, and stings a bit. This started in the past few days.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m taking her to a gyno tomorrow, for my first appointment. She&#39;s gonna get a full exam and look over so the doc can learn my anatomy.
</p>
<p>
Nerve pain is kicking up again, which is bad but also good... that means those nerves are coming back into sensation. I&#39;m on meds, but they&#39;re making me drowsy.
</p>
<p>
Still, I am so damn happy with her. She&#39;s so damn cute, and feels so good. I keep talking to my GF about all the experiences I&#39;d dreaded when pre op, and how I don&#39;t feel so bad anymore. I can pee without tucking, I can shower... I can just chill on my bed with no clothing on a hot night, and be fine.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: She&#39;s a little sick, but I love her anyway.

Also, watched a video of a surgery like mine today. And had to laugh. She had the word graft, printed in blue marker, inside her for about a week... XD
