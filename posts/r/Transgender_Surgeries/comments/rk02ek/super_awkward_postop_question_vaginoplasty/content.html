Hard to say. Sometimes the muscles do wind up making your canal gasp. And during healing you will produce fluid if they didn&#39;t use a wound vacc on you. Without further information on the concern we can&#39;t speculate. The best thing to do is not be concerned unless immense pain occurs.

Everyone&#39;s results are a little different especially with seeing different surgeons. I was and still am fairly swollen. The swelling itself put pressure on my canal so pockets of fluid would get trapped and released. Discharge is normal and white-yellowish coloring is most likely healing skin. As the skin heals layers come off (not like a snake, mostly in particles) allowing for healthy skin underneath. The dead skin is called sluff, and it health to have it.
</p>
<p>
My guess is your gas pushed the swelling enough to release a small pocket of discharge build up which contained dead skin cells.
</p>
<p>
Either way maybe take a picture of the discharge and your doctor can help narrow it down real quick. Hope this helps.

This was the initial stage of the fistula you posted today. Hope you get help from the ER doctors ASAP and for your surgeon better to address their indifference.
</p>
<p>
Keep updates...

You cannot say it&#39;s a fistula unless &#34;there is obvious fecal matter exiting the neo vagina&#34; ! From my post SRS care documents.
</p>
<p>
Gas could be from dilating or douching.
</p>
<p>
Please also note normal discharge can be brown and smell awful as flesh inside the tube heals.

It was already a fistula! Her post today confirms it.

It&#39;s not necessarily that. I&#39;ve had the same thing minus the pus, not sure if it was trapped air from dilation or an actual fart that was squeezed toward the front, and I don&#39;t have a fistula. The pus or whatever fluid it is could be for other reasons as well, not all of them cause for concern.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s good that you&#39;re seeing your surgeon tomorrow so you can know for sure what it is, though.
