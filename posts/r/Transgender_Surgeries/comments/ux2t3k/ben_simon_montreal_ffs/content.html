Hey all!
</p>
<p>
I’m starting to save for my FFS finally and am hoping this fall I can maybe get it done. I have no family or friends who can travel with me unfortunately. Has anyone used the over night nursing service they mention on their page? I have a consult coming up but wouldn’t mind hearing from some women who already got it done.
</p>
<p>
I’m thinking I need cheek implant nose job and forehead. How long were you until you felt ok to travel?
</p>
<p>
Any tips or suggestions I’d appericiate!
</p>
<p>
Ty!

Some quick notes from my own experience since you haven&#39;t got any responses yet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If you&#39;re going, definitely do an overnight stay if at all possible. I just got mine done this past week (Jumaily- nose, jaw/chin, tracheal shave) and the first night was the worst- going home right away honestly would have been a mistake. I don&#39;t know about Benson&#39;s nursing staff but they were incredibly helpful in doing even basic functions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I took a quick ride the next day following surgery, but only about 15 minutes. You&#39;ll be all drugged up on painkillers and anti nausea and unable to drive while on them, most likely, and the three days following surgery were the worst.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This is purely personal opinion, but I had a quote from Dr Bensimon and I did not get a very good impression. I noted the things I was conscious of (everything listed above + forehead to a lesser extent), but my concerns were not acknowledged at all and I was suggested only lip fillers- which did not give me the most confidence. Don&#39;t let this affect your decision too much, but that was a major negative at least for me.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
-If you can, I&#39;d strongly recommend finding someone to care for you in the days following. While I&#39;m sure I could have
<em>
survived
</em>
without my friend here, I cannot emphasize how massively it helped having someone there to guide you through - especially for nasal aftercare.
</p>
<p>
This is all just personal thoughts again but hope that helps at least a little :)

Very helpful ty! So there’s three days I’ll plan to be down and out. Mayb I’ll get nursing care then go to a hotel. Was there a two week check up with yours?

That&#39;s a decent plan. Took me a solid 3 days to feel like a human again. If you can get care the whole time even better.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get a two week check up- only after one week, though there should be a six month follow up if I&#39;m able to make it back out to Toronto. I just got back from my one week today and it was just to make sure there were no serious missed issues and to get sutures out.

Hi! I know this is a super old comment but could I please DM you with some questions about your experience with Jumaily?
