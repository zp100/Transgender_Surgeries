SRS was always a dream of mine as soon as I discovered its existence. Ability to be myself and express myself in a correct way was a really big deal to me.  Also I was scared, because there are few places on earth that actually do that surgery correctly. Sadly, there is no such place in Poland. Yes, you can undergo SRS in Poland, but it&#39;s risky due to the lack of experience of our surgerons. Results may be messy, painful, far from self satisfaction. There is no standardization here.  It forced me to look up for SRS in other countries and finally it led me to Bangkok, Thailand.
</p>
<p>
I spent some time doing research on the internet, reviewing a few clinics, reading a lot of opinions, and I was looking for pics with results. Finally it led me to Dr. Kamol Hospital. I started to check if this place is legit and they passed my research. Then I started to investigate their techniques of SRS, and also got impressed. Finally I decided to get in touch with them and I wrote to them. I got an answer from their English speaking agent named Darcie, who gave me all the details I needed to consider that surgery. It took me some time to collect money for it (about 20 000 usd), but finally I was ready to recontact her again and book a deadline for surgery. Also got all the info on how to prepare for surgery and from time to time check ups if things are going well. She was very helpful.
</p>
<p>
When I made it to the Hospital/hotel I was well taken care of. Staff asked me about all the important info, Darcie was even more intense in contact with me and I simply went with the flow and followed instructions. If I ever had any doubts or concerns I was replied with all the information that I needed. Everyone was very helpful and polite.
</p>
<p>
The good thing about the hospital is that they are not only after your money. I know, it&#39;s business but I was about to undergo a PPV SRS and I was warned about complications and risks and also offered alternatives. They could simply do that surgery and make me deal with it and then I would be forced to return and pay for it all over again but they didn‚Äôt. Which is very nice. Doctors are very confident about their skills and they are all very skilled because they do few of these surgeries per day. You can expect results that actually fit a certain standard.
</p>
<p>
Darcie, my agent, was very helpful and she was always by my side when I needed her. Sometimes it took her a little bit more time to respond to my messages but only because she simply performed a few professions at once. Still, I always got answers for everything and if I had to see a doctor before surgery or after or had some sort of important meeting with someone from the hospital she always has been there for me. She even made me tea when I was about to remove my catheter which was super cute. And yes, you can&#39;t forget about lollipops that she gives to everyone haha. True sweetheart.
</p>
<p>
All the procedures about surgery itself and after were very professional. Post-op care was top of the top. I was able to have any medicine that I needed, if I had some sort of discomfort nurses provided me with their help. They were very polite and understood my situation. Very empathetic and helpful. Sanitary conditions were also very nice, they cleaned the entire hospital every two hours. Also I got check ups a few times a day and was able to call nurses at any time. After hospital care I was dismissed to a hotel that belongs to the hospital and there I continued my recovery in comfort. I had wound dressing two times a day, same thing for dilations. I was instructed how to take care of myself and also taught how to take care of myself after I return home.  And was gifted with a set of dilators and medicines. It was all very useful and the nurses were so gentle with my vagina, which actually looked very good, even being swollen after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I was very impressed that Darcie managed to bring some other girls to meet up and we created a group together &lt;3. I was able to meet some really lovely people and have some fun. I‚Äôm very grateful for it. It was such an amazing experience.
</p>
<p>
About 3 weeks after the surgery I had my flight back and I was more than ready and prepared for it. All thanks to experienced doctors, nurses and a lovely agent named Darcie. I realize that it looks almost like a laurel but who knows, maybe I got lucky or it‚Äôs just reality in that hospital. All I wanted to point out is that the standard of this place is very high and they are really focused to help you and leave you with results that will make you happy and satisfied. .
</p>
<p>
At the hotel I saw many girls that spent a lot of time in their rooms and never left to sightsee the neighborhood. I wanted to mention this because actually I explored that neighborhood and It turned out to be very safe and welcoming. Yes, you should be careful crossing the streets but It‚Äôs not something people aren‚Äôt able to get used to. And it&#39;s completely worth it. Food is great, you can spend some lovely time out there enjoying it and many more.
</p>
<p>
Just to sum it up it was more than just an SRS. It was some kind of a journey. And mostly it happened thanks to beloved Darcie. I made this trip to Thailand just to find out it was more than surgery. Also I am very satisfied with my results. I was expecting to be in pain all the time and not be able to do anything but actually I started to live like I used to very quickly. I was so impressed, still am.

I do my surgery ppv in 14november  with doctor kamol and its truth that the hospital nurses and the stuff in garden hotel are so nice and helpful and everything is clean . Darcie was so nice with me to before surgeri and after my surgery in thaillande and she give me the lolypop and lovely üß∏after i have probleme to remove the cathedral but honestly im sad that they are not so honest with us because before they suggest ppv like the best technique with good benefit and more safe than the colon srs but naw they suggest the colon srs than ppv so its not professional and not really safe for us
