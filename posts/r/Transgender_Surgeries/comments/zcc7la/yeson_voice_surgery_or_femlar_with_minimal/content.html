Resonance depends on the surrounding structures, I am not sure that Thomas can change the sinuses, the chest, tracheal tree, pharynx, oral cavity and nasal cavities.   I looked at Yeson and Thomas, and I believed the outcomes with Yeson was much better than Thomas.   Either way you need to work at where you want your voice projected from.  That is the reason Yeson requests vocal training at 2 months post op to make sure you get the most out of the reconstructed vocal folds.    I am also one month out and still in the silence period, but I have full faith in Dr. Kim   I am not sure if Thomas&#39;s surgery will give you the ability to sing after surgery whereas Dr. Kim&#39;s does

His protocol asks one to not speak at all for one month, which is a small price to pay to get the most benefit from the procedure.  The vast majority of patients  also receive a Botox injection into the larynx, not sure if my did much good, but that in itself will decrease your ability to talk for a month.  My vocal cords were asymmetrical and that was repaired during the procedure.  At one month the pitch increases a little, once you do the vocal exercises at two months there is a dramatic increase according to the graphs that Dr. Kim had.

That&#39;s awesome. I hope your recovery goes well :)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m starting to lean towards Yeson after doing more research. I agree with you that Yeson&#39;s outcomes seem to be better and more consistent.

How long did you stay in Korea for after surgery? I know that flying back would be hell if you can&#39;t speak. Especially if you have to talk to a flight attendant.

Was there 10 days, arrived day before consultation, next day surgery, final follow up 4 days thereafter.   I stayed a few more days for another optional surgery as with the dollar exchange rates, it was a great deal for a minor surgery procedure.    As for flying back, when  getting on the plane, drop a note to the attendant you are unable to speak and let them know you will be passing notes to communicate with.  Same thing for customs upon state side arrival.

Thanks for the info. I&#39;m wanting VFS myself since though my voice passes I tend to drop into the male register quite often because it hurts my throat to keep it there without surgery.
</p>
<p>
I did vocal training years ago and still keep up with the exercises but the throat pain is just too much sometimes trying to keep it there without some kind of surgical help.

I&#39;d love to hear more about your experience this far, both on the procedure as well as your trip to Yeso. I&#39;m scheduled late January, and am so ready to go already!
</p>
<p>
Any tips for the trip itself of any advice for the procedure you think would be helpful to know before going?

Off my silence period about 1/2 week, very hoarse to start with but am pleased was normally about 150HZ now about 230hz if I watch my Resonance, Dr. Kim&#39;s graph says I will probably go higher especially after the training program.  It should be noted I am well outside his age limit and I acknowledged that when I elected to undergo the procedure.  Advice,  January,  bring very warm clothes, don&#39;t catch a cold before or after, don&#39;t even try to talk the first month, and plan on wearing a mask on flight into and out of Korea as well as in public spaces as it is expected there yet.  Overall all, the Korean people are very  friendly and Yeson was a very positive experience, and Jessie  is such a great person.

Stay away from Dr Thomas, and Femlar in general. Go with Yeson, Haben, the guy in South America. I’ll probably do a better job performing surgery than Dr Thomas.

I would go with FemLar. It’s the only one that addressees both AND takes care of any tracheal shave needs at the sand time. He did my surgery, though I had a less invasive form.

Yeah, it&#39;s really tempting. The idea of having the surgery and not having to worry about pitch or resonance is awesome. I didn&#39;t know about the tracheal shave as well, my adams apple isn&#39;t that prominent but this is totally a bonus to me! :)
</p>
<p>
It just seems like there&#39;s not as much info out there on FemLar and the results from it.
</p>
<p>
Are you happy with your results? Why did you get the less invasive version?

I had major complications. I ended up with a deeper voice and uneven vocal cords. The girl that had surgery the same day had a massive injection for months. I went to Katherine yung to fix it.   Btw you will have to worry about resonance still. There are very few that can go without but unless you are late teens or early 20s young and have already a borderline vocal tract you will rely heavily on voice therapy.

The more I research the more it seems like his results are quite inconsistent. Sometimes it goes well and sometimes there are big complications.

There’s a lot of info out there about FemLar if you look for it. It’s been around for a long time and has a fair amount of published stuff he’s done. I think it probably does more for you than the Yeson procedure long term and addresses more issues; just raising pitch often isn’t enough. I vocal webbing similar to what Yeson does and also had a laser vocal cord reduction by Dr. Thomas. I am happy and my results were good. I did not have a prominent Adam’s Apple at the time and did not want the visible scar from FemLar. However, after a large weight loss and a few years aging I suddenly find things have changed and I suddenly do have a visible tracheal prominence so I am headed back to Dr. Thomas to see about a tracheal shave. I don’t trust anybody else to do it as I don’t want to risk complications to my voice surgery. If I had it to do all over again, I would I have just done the FemLar from the get go and taken care of all of it at once.

Femlar can damage your vocal cords to the point of requiring silicon implants on the edge. Luckily I did not need that but Katherine yung is dealing with multiple femlar complications Thomas’ patients including myself.  My vocal cord edge will never be the same and my clarity will never be the same. I have to rely on voice training and air and resonance to really have an as clear a voice as I did before surgery. If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with Katherine yung. She is probably the most experience fvs surgeon as she was the ucsf surgeon before she went private practice but she doesn’t promote herself online. She has been the go to for all of the Bay Area transwomen which is a lot.

One of those was another surgery yea. And the next would be an additional surgery. He said for me personally the in office laser is not working for me as it does for others, so the last revision was under the knife at the surgical center. The others were office visit revisions with the laser, with little to no changes.

I&#39;ve had VFS (Yeson Technique by a Melbourne Surgeon) and still need to do heaps of voice therapy, the surgery can be a bit hit and miss with results. Have you seen an ENT surgeon who can assess your vocal cords and tell you if anything is holding you back? That would be my first step 💜

I&#39;m not sure that it helped raise my pitch. My voice is gentler and more vibratory, but it is still at 140Hz resting. The most important thing has been voice training, learning how to comfortably pitch raise and bring my resonance forward. It honestly has taken a year for me to start doing it properly which I found so frustrating. Sometimes it just takes a long time for our brains to realise what the instructions mean, what it feels like, etc. Now it is starting to work more. You might just need to give practice more time to really focus on forward resonance while narrowing your voice. Surgery might take away your lower range, but it also might not.
