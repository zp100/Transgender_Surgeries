Hello everyone, I wanted to give a brief update on my recovery but also do some quick house cleaning on a few things I help manage.
</p>
<p>
I promised some time ago to provide a 1 year update and that did not happen, primary because of the escalation of hostility towards trans people in general in the last year. I will not be posting any identifiable pictures of myself but I do have my pictures from day 1 to all the way to a year of recovery on the Website for Mozaic (Dr.Wittenberg + Dr.Bonnington) and I feel like I am fairly representive of the overall aesthetic and it has not changed hardly at all rom 1 year in to today other than the scars slowly fading. It feels bad to delete my old posts but it no longer feels safe to have my intimate pictures posted publicly. I am just posting to restate some general information about my recovery and how to get into the mozaic server. Some of my replies to my old posts are still on my profile so if you are curious about that then they should be accessible that way.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
That being said lets get into this. This will be somewhat comprehensive but if there was ANYTHING you had specific questions about please feel free to ask
</p>
<p>
Office experience:
</p>
<p>
Overall I had a good experience with Mozaic, some of their staff can be a bit abrasive but the surgeons are both lovely. My Surgeon specifically was Dr.Bonnington, he is much less known of the two but I would argue produces identical work to his much more recognized colleague. He was extremely lovely to work with before and after surgery at the many follow ups. It was somewhat of a headache to keep people on task with getting insurance on board with everything but its impossible to tell who was actually dropping the ball, neither Mozaic or Aetna want to take credit for how much of a headache it was to get things approved and confirmed and even after all that I got surprise bills from the Anesthesiologist.  Get EVERYTHING in writing.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Recovery :
</p>
<p>
Week 1
</p>
<p>
Waking up post up was the best of my life, hands down. Anesthesia drugs are amazing like that. I felt completely at peace with the universe and pretty much stay that way for a week or so. I did struggle with walking and not fainting but I am pretty sure that was because I was at a pretty borderline weight, almost no other mozaic patients I have spoken to reported that issue.
</p>
<p>
Wound vacc+Catheter. I had no issues with the would vacc personally but I HATED the catheter, due to the timing I ended up with both for 9 days total and I was SO done with the cath by the end of it. Worst part of recovery by far for me.
</p>
<p>
week 2
</p>
<p>
Packing removal day finally came and it was one of the most bizarre  sensations of my entire life. It was very unpleasant but not painful perse. This was one of the moments I was most afraid of preop and it ended up being not being a big deal. I passed the pee test (2/3 people do) so I could go without the cath which was 10/10 amazing. The first time dilating, which I was also terrified of, was also mostly a nothing sandwhich. I was totally numb and didn&#39;t really feel anything. Dilating was pretty anxiety inducing at first but fairly quickly became pretty boring. Really Really boring and still is to this day.
</p>
<p>
week 3
</p>
<p>
I started to have bit of separation which I beat myself up for terribly. This would eventually heal but I was pretty scared for a while of losing one of my labia minora to retraction but that never  happened but it did get close.  I also ended up with a small pinky sized hole in the other labia that has since become basically a pin sized one  today completely invisible unless you know where to look. Swelling was pretty intense but manageable I was icing pretty much 24/7
</p>
<p>
week 4
</p>
<p>
I finally was given the go ahead to leave the SF area, healing was going well, dilating was boring, I doubled down on bedrest to help the separation heal and it did gradually. The immense amount of walking and waiting around in the airport to get home was the worst part of  getting back, I would strongly recommend anyone getting any form of bottom surgery request a wheelchair accommodation for your time in the airport. missing the mid-day dilating session SUCKS this early on. Every single one counts and it snowballs if you miss them NEVER SKIP DILATING EVER.
</p>
<p>
Month 2
</p>
<p>
After the first month and I got home I was officially allowed to size up. I was using the petite 2 dilator from soul source as my first dilator and moving from that to the #1 dilator was difficult. It took nearly a month to get to full depth on the new dilator. That was the worst one honestly, going from 1 to 2 then 3 then 4 was far less bad. this was mostly bed rest with some activity, it took me a LONG time to feel like I could think normally. I was quick to exhaust and everything felt fuzzy, was nearly impossible to focus. Recovery is mostly boring, that is kinda the overall for me.
</p>
<p>
Month 3
</p>
<p>
I started to be able to brain again, I had progressed to the big orange dilator just in time for my 3 month follow up, at that time I had my first return visit to SF to see my doctor and I had started to develop a fair bit of granulation and I got a silver nitrate treatment that seemed to resolve most of that, though it was extremely gross to have a grey discharge for like a week after. I was still very much in recovery mode when I had to go back to work though I was able to do light duty for a few more months which was nice. I could have theoretically had sex at this point but I still had a LOT of pokey sutures and discharge so I didn&#39;t really want to try.
</p>
<p>
Month 4-6
</p>
<p>
I was EXTREMELY eager to explore myself physically/sexually and really did not keep my expectations in check. I was able to have my first vaginal orgasm at the 5 month mark which seems pretty typical. Toys worked fine enough, however when the time did finally come that I tried intercourse for real for the first time, It did not work AT ALL and it was devastating I kinda just assumed it would be like cis women where things would just go in and I had no issues with toys and dilators but what I failed to understand is when a penis is attach to another person the angle required was not the easiest to achieve and I had areas of tightness that proved VERY difficult to get through for a penis that can actually feel how much it was being squeezed.
</p>
<p>
This began a very long learning period and a downward spiral. This is a big part of why I did not update for nearly a year.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Month 6-12
</p>
<p>
It took MANY tries and a bunch of patience to get to where it worked and even then it became extremely apparent to me that what I could handle in terms of dilator was not 1 to 1 with what I could handle from an actual penis. Dilators are hard and can force their way in, real penis not so much and frequently would end up pushing against my urethra which is extremely unpleasant. I recovered pretty  steadily, my follow ups at 6-9 and 12 months were pretty uneventful other than growing frustration with how uncooporative insurance was being. What I didn&#39;t realize entirely at the time was there was a pressure building up in me emotionally. Being fixated on getting ready for surgery then recovering and FIXATING on my goals sexually was acting like the air in the balloon holding me up. When the final follow up came and went, I finally just broke.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
month 12 to present 18 months.
</p>
<p>
Depression, extreme depression. It was a complete mindfuck to me how bad it was. Never in my life did I contemplate suicide so frequently or seriously. This isn&#39;t my doctors fault by the way this was a me not taking care of me issue. Without all the energy of surgery and transition related things my entire sense of self caved in on itself and I fell into a terrible state, I had to hand off my responsibilities for the mozaic GCS server (which is still around and doing well, I will get to it shortly) and I spiraled pretty horribly. I stopped taking all my meds regularly, I would maybe take like.. 2mg of my oral Estrogen a WEEK when I used to take 4mg daily, which obviously just made things worse. Binge eating, the whole 9 yards. Total self-destruction. I only dilated the absolute minimum I could and pretty inconsistently, It seems liked 2x a week was about what was my needed minimum to not bleed a ton but I was being extremely half-hearted about it and definitely lost some depth (from 4 dots to 2.5-3) from that and exasperated my issues with penetration. I&#39;m still recovering from this place emotionally to be honest but I am getting better, its been a week or so of being on top of all my meds again, the suicidal ideation has gone away for the most part and I am beginning to feel conscious of my of well being again but it took a ton of introspection and making peace with myself.
</p>
<p>
Recovery TLDR: I recovered, none of my complications were permanent, dilating is boring, please for the love of god take care of yourself emotionally, be kind to yourself, be patient with yourself, never forget how to love and care for the person that lives within your body.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
PPT: So, I got ppt. I think its a bit overhyped in hindsight. I do wonder if I would have had an easier time with sex if I went with a more traditional PI but thats impossible to know now. Here is what I do know.
</p>
<p>
I love my aesthetic, I feel like it fits me very well and with PI it simply would not have worked out that way without another surgery for a labiaplasty to have the same level of definition. The whole self-lubrication thing is prettttttttty overstated. Yes I do have a natural moistness to my bits and thats nice I spose but it doesn&#39;t really make a whole ton of difference in terms of needing lube for penetration to be comfortable. I have been sexually active while stealth and had NO issues so long as I prefaced that I had some tightness issues and required a bit of patience.
</p>
<p>
Dilating. Is. Forever. I don&#39;t know how many times I needed to state this in other posts and other peoples questions but PPT IS NOT MAGIC, you *HAVE* to dilate sorry, thats just the reality for us with our current technology for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
So now what? I have no idea to be honest. I recently looked at some pictures of myself preop and I don&#39;t regret a thing, that was not me, I wish things were a little easier functionality wise for me but they do work so long as I play by constraints my bits have.
</p>
<p>
The mozaic discord is still around  and going strong with over 100 people who are current, past and consulting patients. I am still happy to invite people who intend to work with them and want more information just dm me for that information. Its a fantastic wealth of knowledge for their specific techniques and the challenges/processes that a little unique to their clinic.
</p>
<p>
And finally I am happy to answer any specific questions you might have just drop a reply or DM. I don&#39;t know if I will make another post in the future but hopefully this post will prove helpful to people who are on the fence. Sorry if its been a bit long winded.

Absolutely, he was fantastic to work with and I got exactly what I hoped out of using him for the surgery. His work is essentially identical to Dr. Wittenbergs.

Awesome! My first choice fell through for quite a few reason and I have a consultation with him tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be so glad when this is all done, the search process is a nightmare.

Wow that is quite a journey. I&#39;m glad you made it. I think most of us don&#39;t prepare for the other side because its such a big lift just to get to surgery day. I don&#39;t think we delude ourselves that recovery will be easy, we just don&#39;t have the spoons to prepare ourselves emotionally for the other side.
