Hey! First of all, looking incredible!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I&#39;m chasing down surgery with Dr Sutin and PAI in the next 18-24 months. If you&#39;re not from Thailand, how did you fare with the language barrier and arranging everything with PAI? Where there any issues arranging transport/accommodation and were you all okay once there?
</p>
<p>
I know I&#39;m probably being a little too on edge about it haha, but as excited I am flying out to a place I&#39;ve never been and don&#39;t speak the language for surgery is still a little spooky!

Actually I communicated through email and one follow up call to Thailand just B4 leaving. All my inquiries were done through email. I emailed thier info email and Peera got back to me with in a few days. As I go closer I kept in contact nore cc and then I be was there. ALL. Of my transportation was taken care of from getting picked up at the airport,taken to all my pre appts to picking me up for surgery and the follow-up after, they cc arex really good and EXPIERIANCED there they have a system and it works, they tell u be where to stay and connect to u with great room rates I suggest the Oakwood. The service was TOP NOTCH.
</p>
<p>
The language barrier wasn&#39;t really an issue, Bune has pretty good English actually he constantly apologized for his bad language but honestly he was great and funny . Dr sutin is very good as well. The only really issue I had was at the hospital during my stay but honestly Google translate was perfect. They understand some English but Google solved that.
</p>
<p>
I would STRONGLY suggest taking a friend or someone u trust with u to help u during ur stay. They can help u prepare meals and help communicate &amp; advocate for u if u can&#39;t. Honestly my whole expieeance was AMAZING, I have zero be regrets and I&#39;m they really do take great care of u . I know exactly how u feel , especially being 10k miles away from home. It bc will be by a worry free experience.
</p>
<p>
I miss Thailand, I really loved it there , the people, the acceptance the service was all great I had never traveled out of country and that was my  1st expieeance I goty passport just for that trip I can&#39;t wait to go back.
</p>
<p>
I have had absolutely ZERO complications , I have healed well and everything works as it&#39;s supposed to. I have üíØ% feeling and my orgasms are the WOW factor. Feel free to send me a message if u have any more questions. Hope that helps.

I am dragging my best mate along haha (and he&#39;s been to Thailand before, so I figure I shan&#39;t be completely up shit creek if I get stuck). Thus far I&#39;ve just been in touch with someone called A over email, and am just waiting to get a letter from my endo to move ahead with making an appointment :)

nope, Burin doesnt operate as much, he only deals with people who are from thailand he doesnt do westeners from my understanding, u have seen my results and they are awesome. ive never spokin with anyone who used Burin, and i did a ton of research before going here. In my opinion Dr. Sutin is a Artist!! im extremely happy.

I&#39;m considering sigmoid one from dr theerapong! What made you choose this technique? My main concerns are depth and lubrication!

i was by no means messing with my bowels. to me it wasnt worth it, this is a time tested and devolped technique by PAI, so i prefereed to use this one, im ver glad i did, not only was it less recovery but less hassle because i didnt have to worry about my bowels or any issues with healing.

Hi, may I ask, where you uncircumcised or circumcised? I heard that makes a big difference with the technique.
