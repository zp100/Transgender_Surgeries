Yeah that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening to me lol. Dilating does hurt but not the painful area down there, it hurts my clit area and labia. Right now I keep having to put toilet paper down there to keep it dry, but it just gets wet again.

I do have gauze but I&#39;m scared it&#39;s going to get really wet and saturated. I will try it though. Should I just put polysporin on it, and jam it between my legs? How do I keep it from falling out?

I&#39;d ask your doctor/caregiver about the last part, but I know toilet paper can possibly leave little pieces behind.

Thank you for helping I really appreciate everything. Im a little bit more calm now. I&#39;m using super thick toilet paper it&#39;s like soft paper towel, it doesn&#39;t break apart easily. I&#39;ll try gauze later, I just don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to stay up there.

It says your comment is missing. You said 27 days, where did you get your surgery done and with what surgeon? Also what did the clinic tell you? To just tough it out?

Speaking from experience, for anyone reading this NOW and panicking abt themselves, yes, it will heal up fine on its own, will literally just “zip itself shut” as my surgeon says. It will hurt but keep dilating, do not stop dilating or you will have worse problems than wound dehiscence. Keep clean, use STERILE GAUZE!!! No paper towels no toilet paper, use gauze and change every few hours. Wear a pair of undies and jam the gauze against the wound, it will help. Shower TWICE A DAY and CLEAN THE AREA WITH MILD ANTIMICROBIAL SOAP both times you shower. This is extremely important for your healing.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps anyone else panicking abt their wounds separating, much luv y’all and good luck!

Keep it clean, use polystyrene.  Dry the !rea with a hair dryer on low. Cover with gauze hold in place with your underwear.

Go to the ER? Do you feel like you are in some kind of medical emergency? If you truly feel that way you should take the necessary steps.
</p>
<p>
With that said and based solely on the image you have irritating, but fairly standard wound dehiscence. It&#39;s painful because healing through second intention involves a lot of tissue granulation. It&#39;s normal. you might try using Vaseline to avoid the urine burn. But yeah, it can feel pretty brutal when this happens.

I just got freaked out by the color and i think its been oozing a little bit. Also the pain is a little bit unbearable right now. But earlier the clinic told me its fine and to just keep it dry. But I&#39;m honestly paranoid its going to get infected while im sleeping. I really appreciate your support and help. I guess i should just be more patient.

Granulation tissue like that is absolutely zero fun. I had covering the entire entrance of my vulva for 6 weeks. Dilating was pure torture. So much I had to drop back to smaller and smaller dilator to get things to heal. This is the main drawback from wound dehiscence, it increases the healing and recovery time.  Keep things clean, you&#39;ll be fine, just because it&#39;s painful doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s infected.

Just feel the need to come to the thread here since it’s the first thing to come up when googling and has some advice that is the exact opposite of my surgeons feedback and that I’ve gotten from my nurse boyfriend.
</p>
<p>
First, you don’t need to keep wounds super dry. In fact most wounds including dehiscence will heal quicker if left in their natural slightly moist gooey state. Drying out wounds excessively can actually delay healing.
</p>
<p>
That being said it is still in an area where sanitation is concerned so follow your surgeons instructions there. Common recommendation is cleansing twice a day with a peri-bottle using antibacterial soap diluted in warm water and spritzing with diluted hydrogen peroxide after using the restroom. But, always just gently pat dry and try not to bother the area.
</p>
<p>
Second, unless your surgeon recommends applying a topical or prescribes a steroid cream then don’t put anything on the area.
</p>
<p>
Wound separation happens more than 50% of the time and the best thing you can do is leave it alone to heal.
