<p>
Hey y&#39;all!
</p>
<p>
At a bit of a crossroads here. I&#39;ve been working towards getting vaginoplasty for almost ~4 years now, and I&#39;ve always thought I wanted the peritoneal method, but I&#39;m not sure anymore.
</p>
<p>
I live in British Columbia and am going through the clinic here at Vancouver General Hospital. I&#39;m nearing the end of electrolysis and I just had one of my pre-op consults. Because of the info available online, I&#39;ve always leaned to peritoneal as my preferred method, and I&#39;ve been saying as much from the beginning- but it turns out the availability of the machine they use means I&#39;d have to wait between 18-24 months to get peritoneal done. Whereas if I were to do a standard method I could get it done in as little as 3 months, barring any complications with finishing electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
(Side note, yes, you
<em>
can
</em>
get peritoneal in Canada- I see a lot of posts here saying you can&#39;t, but it
<em>
is
</em>
an option at VGH- just as I noted you&#39;ll have to wait a while.)
</p>
<p>
Thing is... with the information the surgeons provided, I don&#39;t know if peritoneal is even
<em>
worth
</em>
the extra wait? They used to want to do peritoneal for every surgery but after performing some found very minimal extra benefit, while adding extra risk/potential for complications after surgery, and using up an option often better used for revisions.
</p>
<p>
And while I
<em>
am
</em>
passing along pretty much exactly what the surgeons said, I&#39;m also relaying it in a way that is prone to my own bias. Do your own research and ask your own questions to your surgeon when it comes time, and don&#39;t base your own decisions off of my post. With that said, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Self lubrication- seems to be entirely a myth. Peritoneal tissue does not self lubricate. It
<em>
does
</em>
retain moisture better, which can have a similar effect, but that doesn&#39;t make a net positive- as that can potentially cause complications of its own (i.e. with infections, bacteria can linger longer). Lubrication happens because of the glands in the area- and even with penile inversion they retain the glands that produce lubrication, though it still ends up being less than that of a natal vulva (about 1/5th).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More similar tissue to a natal vaginal canal- they noted that there isn&#39;t actually
<em>
much
</em>
difference and in any case, you should be going for what gives medically the best result in its own right.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Frees up more tissue to form the external vulva- only true if you lack material to begin with, i.e. from puberty blockers. If you have any amount of material to work with penile inversion will work fine and still allow for good external appearance. Basically, the difference in construction of the canal is that with penile inversion, ~3cm are from skin at the base of the shaft, and 7-10cm from a scrotal graft. In peritoneal, they do ~3cm from the base of the shaft, another ~3cm from the scrotal graft, and the rest from peritoneal. They have not found benefit in skipping the scrotal graft except, again, in cases of not having enough tissue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Less healing time/less need to dilate; entirely false. The entrance to the canal is the main part that causes issues and doing peritoneal doesn&#39;t change that aspect, and it again doesn&#39;t have a proven benefit here.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On top of that, there&#39;s some extra potential downsides:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Because the peritoneal still has the scrotal graft, it has 2 joints that need to heal, instead of just 1; which has extra potential for complications.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Unknown long term side effects. No proven benefits. Most studies done on the subject have very few patients and don&#39;t have enough data to show anything real.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Creates extra scars on the abdomen where the machine enters. I think scars are cool honestly but I don&#39;t want more unnecessarily.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They
<em>
have
</em>
said it&#39;s amazing for revisions. i.e. if the vaginal canal collapses for any reason. And if you&#39;ve done peritoneal for primary vaginoplasty, it uses up that option and makes revisions much harder if it comes to it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not a downside, exactly, but it also seems like surgeons who predominantly advertise peritoneal do so as a selling point (i.e. many in the U.S.) as they are for profit. Which creates a bias to make it seem like a better option than it is. Not saying any of these surgeons are bad- the results I&#39;ve seen look great and the people I&#39;ve talked to have had great experiences- but there seems to be a lot of marketing hype that might not reflect reality, and it&#39;s affected me too.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Basically, as much as I want peritoneal, I don&#39;t know if I can wait another 2 years for it. I&#39;ll be 23 by then and I want to be done with this transition ASAP, and while I
<em>
definitely
</em>
should have been on the wait list already and think the system is very unoptimized, at this point I&#39;m really not seeing a benefit to waiting anymore. I want to be at peace with my body. I&#39;m tired of having an M on my medical paperwork. I want to have intimacy without reservations and not have to deal with the
<strong>
constant
</strong>
discomfort and dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone have experience with peritoneal they&#39;d like to share, or positive experiences with inversion? Information I have wrong or missing, or quality, peer reviewed studies that go against something I&#39;ve been told? Or just thoughts in general about this method vs. standard inversion? This whole thing has kinda flipped my expectations upside down so I want input to figure out where I&#39;m going from here.
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR Peritoneal doesn&#39;t seem to actually have any proven benefits and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth waiting an extra 2 years for what might be a placebo effect/misleading marketing.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Edit #1: Currently considering the potential of a zero depth vaginoplasty with a later peritoneal revision. Best of both worlds. Will bring it up my next consult. Just came up with this idea now so it may change but it&#39;s at least offered me some peace of mind with this very tough decision.
</p>
<p>
Edit #2, two months later: I&#39;m going for peritoneal. They can&#39;t do minimal depth with a revision because a certain amount of the canal is penile skin regardless. So, I&#39;m waiting the extra however many years, and can switch back to penile inversion any time if dysphoria is too much. I&#39;m emotionally attached to the idea + frankly I just don&#39;t want my vaginal canal to be made of penile skin when peritoneal is an option.

I had PPT with Dr Bluebond-Langner and Dr Zhao at NYU in September. My takeaways aren&#39;t really consistent with what they&#39;ve informed you of. Granted a lot of one&#39;s experience with surgery will be ENTIRELY subjective. Regardless of technique it will affect different people well.. differently. I don&#39;t think there really is a firm science but I&#39;m sure there are some consistencies to be able to document and determine some things that are likely to happen. PPT has really only been done for a few years so the technique is still new and being improved upon with further experience with it.
</p>
<p>
Bringing up the subject of self lubrication is hard to measure. Some women naturally lubricate more than others. It would then follow that sensitive tissues such as the peritoneum would be more or less active depending on the subject being studied. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any conclusive evidence in either direction but having the pull through technique does provide the possibility for your canal to be more attached to your body and involved with your internals than just an inverted canal. All that being said, I haven&#39;t gotten to sexually explore a lot at this point in time and don&#39;t really know if I get excited enough to really produce much of anything but I do stay moist down there all day long though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a unique characteristic of my surgery type.
</p>
<p>
Speaking about the tissue difference I don&#39;t think I ever heard this mentioned in any of my prior research but it probably is a bit different when one is observing the peritoneal tissue rather than the inverted skin. Over time and through sloughing much of the inverted skin will have a similar type of feel as the body will manage it.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t speak too much about the third point because I didn&#39;t have any lack of tissue. I had lost some tissue over the course of my HRT for 4 years but it wasn&#39;t significant enough to put into worry of any concerns. Although I could see the benefit if someone did need that extra bit to get a &#34;Close to cis&#34; representation in terms of depth.
</p>
<p>
And as to less healing time and less time to dilate, I don&#39;t know who says that but it&#39;s false. Since PPT includes the basic inversion technique plus a Peritoneal graft it will have approximately the same healing time. I am still currently healing at 6 months but I can say I got back up to normal physical ability within 4 weeks. I&#39;m not sure what the average is but I&#39;m not a very active person so it took me a little longer.
</p>
<p>
As far as there being no benefits or a detriment? I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s true at all and think they need to correct their approach with that information.
</p>
<p>
My surgery only took 3 hours as opposed to the 6-7 it normally takes. Since they use the robot to stitch up the internal end of the canal at the same time the plastic surgeon seals up the exterior. The scars on the abdominal area are minimal. One 1 inch incision at the belly button and 1-2 on each side of the abdominal area at the waist. Since they already go in with the robot it is immediately is easy for them to re-enter if there are any serious complications post surgery and becomes easier for them to follow-up on internal concerns. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s much merit to their point that doing PPT somehow makes it harder to do revisions? I&#39;d warrant not if they were done by the same team so that seams like a nonsensical point of view. Of course it would be hard for a surgeon to follow-up on another&#39;s work. Overall, my healing has been pretty easy minus some blood clots in my labia majora which is a complication from any type of surgery. I can&#39;t say that having a PPT put me to the detriment that your surgical team seems to assume it is. Dr BBL and Dr Zhao, to my knowledge, only do PPT now. They do quite a few patients per year and yes waiting for the robot can be tough but I chose PPT because it made the most sense to me. Not to mention the fact that if the canal is anchored in the peritoneal tissue then there is less of a chance to lose a significant amount of depth. I could be mistaken on that and if I&#39;m proven wrong I will change my stance but their story doesn&#39;t seems consistent with my experience.

Wasn&#39;t sure how to respond to this comment, but wanted to say I appreciate the input! So just to break it down, the advantages you felt you saw are:
</p>
<p>
-The material it&#39;s made of
</p>
<p>
-Shorter surgery time
</p>
<p>
-Canal anchored in peritoneal tissue
</p>
<p>
Anything else to mention?
</p>
<p>
I just don&#39;t
<em>
particularly
</em>
see how your experience contradicts what I was told by the surgeons.

I can&#39;t say there any many other things I would say differ in my experience and a standard inversion. I think that eventually PPT will replace normal inversion because it&#39;s the same with slightly improved technique. My only point was that I don&#39;t think that there are much of anything that could be considered worse other than waiting for the machine.

Hm neat.
</p>
<p>
Honestly despite everything I am still interested in peritoneal. As I said in my edit I am considering asking for minimal depth with a later peritoneal revision, just because I do like the idea more, and if there&#39;s even a
<em>
chance
</em>
at anything people say about it, it&#39;s the method I&#39;d prefer. And I can make do with just having a vulva and no canal for 2 years, but I certainly can&#39;t wait 2 years to get rid of what I have.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the input.

Personally I would look at it this way. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re 30 and your life expectancy is 80, so you have 50 years left. Is it worth spending an extra 4% of your remaining life with a penis for the possibility of better self lubrication? There&#39;s no way I&#39;d make that trade, but it all depends on what you value.
</p>
<p>
Now for my personal opinion (very biased because I&#39;m delighted with my results from inversion):
</p>
<p>
Day to day self lubrication is not a big deal. If you don&#39;t have enough and feel dry, you use some PH balanced gel. There are many such products available because lots of cis women use them. It&#39;s not a big deal.
</p>
<p>
What IS important is maintaining the proper PH balance. A vagina should be around 4-4.5. However, peritoneal secretions have a PH of 7. That means if the peritoneal lining is self lubricating, it&#39;s actively fighting your attempts to keep it in the right PH range. If you don&#39;t maintain PH, then your lactobacilli flora die off and you are at risk for bacterial vaginosis.
</p>
<p>
Also, the kind of self lubrication that I think is more important is responsive-- i.e. you get wet when aroused. That&#39;s all about whether the surgeon keeps your Cowper&#39;s glands and has nothing to do with PPV vs PI.

<p>
Doesn&#39;t really seem worth it, lol
</p>
<p>
I have gotten my list of questions together for the surgeon again, though. Right now I&#39;m leaning to no depth with peritoneal revision; but that all depends on the answers to my questions at the next appointment.

Do you have a source for this? Otherwise I&#39;ll add it to my list of questions.

<p>
It may be the more important type, which won&#39;t change, but I want as close to a natal vagina as
<em>
I
</em>
personally perceive it. Part of that is natural lubrication, and secretions- if peritoneal
<em>
does
</em>
have discharge of any kind (which I&#39;ll ask about) that would actually be a positive for me in terms of dysphoria, even if it doesn&#39;t provide any benefit. Honestly, even if it&#39;s actively detrimental by most people standards and
<em>
does
</em>
produce secretions at all times, I still see that as a positive.
</p>

<p>
Surgeons will be keeping that intact regardless of surgery method.

Thank you for your comment either way, it&#39;s been one of the most helpful so far :)

I heard it from my surgeon at my last follow-up. It&#39;s easy to confirm though-- just Google &#34;peritoneal lining PH&#34; and &#34;vaginal PH&#34;.

Oh yeah I definitely know that natal vaginas have a lower pH. Didn&#39;t know about peritoneal though. Gonna add that to the list. Thanks a bunch :)

I had my surgery done in Montreal in 2002. Inversion. Very happy with the results. I can’t answer this question for you, but is the newer technique really worth wasting 2 years over?

At this point, I&#39;m honestly doubting it. The surgeons have assured me I have the correct anatomy + am in good health to get a great result from regular penile inversion, and don&#39;t believe peritoneal offers benefit.
</p>
<p>
Hence why I&#39;m coming here &amp; asking around to make sure I&#39;m not missing anything, and to have as much possible information before I make a final decision.

interesting points... although if they&#39;ve done a limited amount of PPV surgeries their views perhaps will change from more experience or if they cross-pollinate with other doctors to learn from different techniques.
</p>
<p>
my lean atm is that i&#39;d rather get done sooner and then look at PPV if a revision is needed.  i also think that microbiome issues in the neo-vagina is something that i don&#39;t read enough about and probably has more impact on vaginal health than people realize (with implications for sex, ofc).
</p>
<p>
since they have such detailed opinions about surgical techniques, sounds like they may be more willing to discuss some aspects of surgical technique of which I&#39;m curious... I&#39;d be happy to have doctors like that.  (where i live, doctors are considered Gods and we&#39;re supposed to just let them do w/e to our bodies with no questions... questions annoy the people who were born here.  foreign doctors are pretty chill though).

Yeah, and according to the doctors, peritoneal vs. inversion doesn&#39;t have
<em>
much
</em>
difference, except that peritoneal can actually be detrimental to it in some cases.

Yeah, they both seemed incredibly knowledgeable. They seem to know their shit. They told me there&#39;s no real reason to do peritoneal but if I really see it as what&#39;s best for myself, they&#39;ll put me on the wait list and do it. So I&#39;m weighing if it&#39;s worthwhile.

<p>
This is a main reason I chose here over Montreal. They seem more flexible in terms of providing a more personalized outcome. I specifically am aiming for a larger labia minora because I personally feel it creates a more natural appearance, despite it being against what society views as &#34;perfect&#34;- natural is what I want even if *society don&#39;t think it looks as &#34;good&#34;. The Montreal results seem pretty cookie-cutter and don&#39;t offer that, whereas the surgeons here listened and are keeping it in mind.
</p>
<p>
This was another reason I was hoping for peritoneal (more material to work with) but as I mentioned in my post it turns out that that&#39;s untrue and won&#39;t make a difference for appearance.

Just had vaginoplasty in Montréal with Dr.Brassard yesterday, I am on the same timeline as you and VGH called two weeks ago for my first consult.  I am in a lot of pain as I type this but am glad I didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t wait; moreso after reading your points, thanks for sharing and good luck.

Grats on the surgery! I was there for surgery on March 8th.
</p>
<p>
The first few days suck, but things get better when you&#39;re free of the catheter and dressing. Good luck on your recovery!
</p>
<p>
Also regarding OP, I&#39;m not super informed about peritoneal, but I&#39;m pretty happy with regular inversion.

I had surgery last month with Dr. Del Corral who performs both PPT and PI and he explained things similarly to your OP. He said he thinks the results are more or less equivalent, but PPT is more invasive (so more risk of complications) and makes revisions harder. He uses PPT for people who want or need it, but his recommendation is PI.

Getting peritoneal pull trough upcomming monday so ill let u know what i think of it post op, but most often if u like to take less risk and have the tissue go for inversion. And the selflubracrion isn&#39;t entirly a myth it just hasn&#39;t been studied enough yet it varies alot between people

I saw one on this sub a while back, but don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be able to find it easily. Otherwise I have seen some photos they keep internally, and was impressed by the appearance- but obviously I can&#39;t share that one.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll consider posting my results in a year or two once everything is healed but I don&#39;t know if I particularly like the idea of my genital photos being out there.

So, I only have my initial consult next week, but
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7390498/#!po=76.0870" rel="nofollow">according to this paper</a>
, the peritoneal pull through does appear to yield self lubrication and states quite explicitly that it is pretty ideal in terms of options for self lubrication.
</p>
<p>
This paper may be incorrect, mind you, but i am hesitant to believe that much of the cited literature available to us currently is all wrong about self lubrication.
</p>
<p>
Again, i would defer my opinion for analytical or statistical sources which seem to contradict this paper, but i also don&#39;t know where your information is coming from and so would prefer to err on the side of caution and what scientific evidence i have available

At your mentioning him, i looked him up and watched a video, idk if i liked it with the timestamp correctly but
<a href="https://youtu.be/ufI8vTr1Bi4" rel="nofollow">here we go!</a>
In case I didn&#39;t get the timestamp properly, the relevant section starts at 11:30.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve become yet more confused as to the ppt procedure at this point. He states that he has had patients report self lubrication, even after he ruled some cases of that out due to incomplete draining after hygiene processes (ie douching). He also states that he believes this is the case and lists a number of hypotheses.
</p>
<p>
I think it is safest to assume that a ppt won&#39;t self lubricate, but idk if that is fully the case.

Unfortunately, that study seems limited to one patient, and the study they do link regarding self lubrication doesn&#39;t seem to give the information I need... I think I&#39;ve looked at both previously but hadn&#39;t fully read them until now.
</p>
<p>
First study; Limited to one person, states peritoneal
<em>
may
</em>
yield lubrication (and links to study #2), covers exactly how the surgery was done, and states the patient had self-lubrication post-surgery. However, it doesn&#39;t mention how much lubrication was occurring due to the peritoneal tissue itself vs. the glands, or how much, and how it may vary compared to penile inversion or a natal vagina.
</p>
<p>
Second study; seems to be more hypothetical. It says an advantage is self lubrication but doesn&#39;t specify too much. States more research needs to be done. Most of the cases reference cisgender women who have had the procedure but can&#39;t compare to penile inversion as much. The mentions of epithelialization specifically are about cisgender women and does not mention if similar epithelialization occurs in penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the things mentioned may not be directly applicable to transgender surgery. And it feels very inconclusive. I&#39;ll bring up the study next time I&#39;m in and ask; but the research feels shown does feel quite limited/&#34;hypothetical&#34; and may be misleading in terms of transgender surgery.
</p>
<p>
And while I like to think I&#39;m decent at reading studies, I wish I had more of a background in this to be able to better sort good information from bad :/

I think its important to recognize that case studies are used as indicators for larger studies to be carried out. They shouldn&#39;t be held as the optimal definitive proof certainly, but are still valuable.
</p>
<p>
Moreover, the study definitively states that, 9 months after the procedure, &#34;The latter vaginoscopy revealed good neovaginal surface and self-lubricated.&#34; Does this guarantee lubrication? No, absolutely not. Does it indicate it is something with potential for discussion and further investigation. At this point, i desperately hope so. 😩
</p>
<p>
It is really unfortunate how little information we actually have available to study and try to figure out. Like. Fuck. It shouldn&#39;t be so difficult to find studies about a surgical technique and its long term results when it has been around for at least a few years in its most current iteration.
</p>
<p>
I really thought i understood the procedure, but nopppeee. Apparently we know nothing and its mostly guesswork that I&#39;ve been trying to base life warping decisions around. Great. Ugh.

Yep, that&#39;s how I feel, except I&#39;m at the point where I
<em>
need
</em>
to make the decision for something that will affect the rest of my time on earth.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong that it&#39;s a good case study. It shows a patient who didn&#39;t have enough material to work with from the getgo and had a great result despite that, and I&#39;m happy for whoever they are! But it unfortunately doesn&#39;t act as a comparison point between peritoneal and inversion, just that peritoneal can have good results. Which is important but unfortunately not super relevant to this situation :/
</p>
<p>
Gonna see what other commenters say. But honestly I don&#39;t think I can live another two years like this. I want to get it done. And unless I can find some hard evidence that I&#39;d benefit from peritoneal, I&#39;ll have to make do with inversion.

Honestly yeah, to an extent. Just trying to figure out what&#39;s best for me &amp; my specific needs- I don&#39;t feel I have the same experience or expectations even as other trans women, in a lot of ways.
</p>
<p>
Considering myself more in the non-binary area... Somewhere.
</p>
<p>
So trying to figure out what I want vs what&#39;s actually best has been confusing.

I think I cannot contribute much to your excellent research, but all i can say is that i have been in a similar situation before. i was consulting with a surgeon bc he was offering ppt and by the end of chatting with him and having a consult, i wondered why i would get ppt at all basically exactly for the reasons you mentioned - for me it was not the wait time, it was the higher price that i was considering.
</p>

besides that, i have also been considering going for zero depth first, but i have now settled with just going with an extended PI, see if it works out, and keep all the other stuff for potential revisions - let&#39;s see how that plays out :&#39;)

Check out the YouTube videos from Dr. Min Jun. He covers the subject quite well. Things that stuck with me include that he has all the scrotal tissue to create labia, and he can see where he is going with the placement of the canal because of the robot. He is getting amazing results.

I think I&#39;ve seen some of his stuff.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll keep it in mind but this was something I did ask about and the surgeons assured me I do have enough material to get the aesthetic result I want.
</p>
<p>
After a lot of thinking, I&#39;m currently leaning to doing a minimal depth vaginoplasty, and once the two years roll around, get a peritoneal revision.

Can you expand and say why you think to wait? I don&#39;t know if I see

any

confirmed bonuses to doing so.

I know you&#39;ve gotten a ton of comments already, but as someone who&#39;s also on the waiting list for VGH and also debating the methods this is AMAZING info! Their new nurse told me they don&#39;t do it much but didn&#39;t explain more, and I could get PI at Montreal sooner. It&#39;s also really helpful to hear that a lot of the purported advantages of peritoneal pull-through could be advertising and aren&#39;t proven.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind, could I ask a few questions about your consult?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How long were you on the waitlist for? I know with Montreal I&#39;ll likely be able to get it in the 8-12 months timeframe, but I&#39;ve gotten super inconsistent timeframes from different people about VGH. All else being equal, I&#39;d much rather to VGH because I live in Vancouver (and apparently they have some sort of wound vacuum that really helps with healing?) I&#39;m also considering paying out of pocket for the hair removal to remove that extra waiting time, but I wouldn&#39;t bother for Montreal.
</li>
<li>
How much do room do you have for requesting physical things? At Montreal, you sorta get what you get (which is usually amazing!) but I&#39;d love to be able to request certain things (e.g. slightly more labia minora), anatomy allowing.
</li>
<li>
Did they speak much on the difference in texture between the methods? I guess if the entrance is made of either penile or scrotal skin, the difference in texture might not even be noticeable.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At any rate, it sounds like the differences might be smaller than I was led to believe. This is super helpful advice, and really is making me feel better personally about just going for PI sooner. I hope the decision comes to you! It&#39;s a tough one, but I&#39;ve just been reminding myself that I&#39;ll be so much happier afterwards no matter the technique, maybe that applies to you as well :)

Hey!! Happy to answer :)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Waiting times: There&#39;s been several, but the relevant ones to your situation, it took about a year and a half from the time I got referred to my first appointments, then it usually takes another 1-2 years for hair removal. My hair removal has gone quick because apparently I either have an absurdly high pain tolerance or good response to numbing cream, and I should be done after about ~8 months.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The surgeons definitely seemed like they&#39;re willing to work with you and get you the best result for yourself. I&#39;ve specifically requested a large labia minora and they said they can do that (even with standard PI). The fact that they&#39;re willing to put you on the wait list for peritoneal even if it&#39;s not &#34;needed&#34; speaks volumes I think.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Didn&#39;t specifically ask about texture. It&#39;s one of the questions I have for next time. I&#39;ll try and get back to this after my next appointment but that could be ~3 months or so (would be sooner but I got FFS next month and gotta heal lol). In any case they insist there&#39;s no practical difference in outcomes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As I said in my edit my current goal would be a partial vulvoplasty with minimal depth in ~3 months then go back for a revision later. If there&#39;s even a chance at a
<em>
different
</em>
(not necessarily better) outcome I still want peritoneal- not having much penetrative sex for 2 years is not a big deal but I would honestly rather die than go that much longer with my current setup.
</p>
<p>
Lemme know if you got more questions :)

Ok, that&#39;s very useful for me. Thanks so much! I guess I&#39;m looking at a maximum of an extra year + paying out of pocket for hair removal with VGH vs Montreal (I couldn&#39;t wait the two years to get hair removal paid for, I don&#39;t think). Going to have to think on that one for sure. If you don&#39;t mind posting after your next consult, the information would be super appreciated! Everything I&#39;ve heard about the program at VGH has been fantastic but there&#39;s just so few posts on here and so little information.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, good luck with healing from the FFS and I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found a choice that is good for you :)

For sure!! If I remember in a couple months I&#39;ll try to come back to this sub. Though I&#39;m not super active on this account anymore. I mostly just keep it as a quick access point to trans stuff but it&#39;s kinda hard to take myself seriously when I have such a cringe username/pfp lmao. Thanks 2018 me

Depends how I feel about it but I might end up posting photos post surgery. I&#39;ll see what I think in a year or two when things are healed.

I should put an edit in the post, also planning to do an update post when I&#39;m less exhausted. It&#39;s been a nightmare of an experience that is still ongoing. They just kinda decided to not offer peritoneal anymore, then not actually inform any of the patients waiting for it, refuse to budge on that decision, and taking days or weeks at a time to respond to basic questions.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ve basically wasted two years of my life for nothing and didn&#39;t even have the decency to inform me at any point. But I&#39;m kinda stuck with them and going to go with PIV because I can&#39;t keep waiting any longer and this is the way I can get the surgery the shortest.
</p>
<p>
And to be clear my issues aren&#39;t the competency of the surgeons or anything, just their team&#39;s utter lack of ability to communicate with patients effectively &amp; the fact I&#39;ve completely lost trust in them because of this debacle, but there&#39;s no real options for me to go anywhere else to get the method I actually wanted because I don&#39;t exactly have tens of thousands of dollars lying around to do so. If you want PIV as a procedure you&#39;ll probably have a good experience, but I fundamentally didn&#39;t, so all of this has been pretty shit to go through.

you’re kidding! I just came across this and the knowledge of the doctors in vancouver after searching for good options for months, and was so excited to see that someone where I live offers ppt. They really didn’t give any info on why they’re not seemingly offering ppt anymore? I had such high hopes for a bit there lol

I had my ppt with Dr min Jun and I waited five months but that was right before he became famous and his wait times are longer. After going though recovery, I would still wait a couple years if I could do it all over again.

I&#39;d personally wait. All indications from watching several videos from Dr Wittenberg, Dr Jun and from the generous people that share their results about the possible advantages/risks have convinced me it&#39;s worth the wait.

I don&#39;t see any reason why out of province folks can&#39;t apply- that said, maybe fill out the TranscareBC contact form on their site!

They&#39;ll have the answer if anyone and I&#39;ve had a positive experiences the times I&#39;ve reached out.

I&#39;ve had a great experience with the VGH staff so far. Only problem is that since its public, there is a long wait. And there are ways they could streamline their process with like 0 effort to make it much faster but that&#39;s another topic 🙃
</p>
<p>
Do what&#39;s best for yourself and your body. I&#39;m trying to figure out what&#39;s best for mine. Best of luck!!
