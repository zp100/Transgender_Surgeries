I had FFS in summer 2021. I already had rather fine hair from the start. But the surgery, plus medication etc. lead me having crazy hair loss -&gt; i lost MORE than half the hair I used to have. Plus i developed alopecia areata worsly. Its not always a walk in the park and healing takes a LONG time. The bald spots are growing mostly all back. But the incision scar feels still like im wearing a headband 24/7 on my head. My derMatologist told me the scar SPREAD out (thats why i sometimes felt like my head is tearing apart). So in these parts my hair will never, ever grow back again. The incision still feels like something isnt s part of me, if that makes sense. The feeling on my lower lip and chin is somewhat back - i feel it when I touch my lips n chin softly with my fingers. BUT the feeling is not comparable to what it was before - if feels weird. Tingly, and I cant move my lips like before. Maybe it will never be like before.
</p>
<p>
Also I forgot to mention that my right side is still kind of paralized - like I cant move my brows well but on the left side it works perfectly. So it looks all weird since only one side works well and the other being much lower. (It looks fine when i dont move it, but when I do it looks strange). I hope movement on my right side will improve more in the future.
</p>
<p>
I am quite happy with the results, but remember, appearance is not everything. What are you willing to pay for it?

This is why I’m more interested in coronal incision than hairline. Good choice. Numbness can last for ages.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind naming your surgeon.

i have ffs scheduled fall 22. almost exactly 365 days from now. my hair is very similar to yours and i have been really worried about this exact thing happening to me.
</p>
<p>
did your surgeon or did you anticipate any complications that did or did not occur?
</p>
<p>
would you do this again?
</p>
<p>
who was your surgeon?
</p>
<p>
looking at your hairline it seems like you have some strong growth happening and i bet it will cover much of that :) also, it’s possible that after a year you may be able to get hair transplants if needed to help it even further. this is something i plan on doing if i need it
</p>
<p>
i had cancer on my face removed. the surgeon did a good job. it took six months for the feeling to fully come back. for many months it would feel fuzzy and distant from my face and there were tiny electrical shocks. but sensation did fully return. what did your surgeon say about the tingling feeling you have? do they think full feeling will come back?
</p>
<p>
thank you so much for sharing ♥

I understand ur concern, I dont know much about the other method where they don‘t cut from ear to ear but along on the hairline. Maybe that‘s going to be a better solution for you?
</p>
<p>
About ur questions: my surgeon told me I was healing very, very slow. But I am only 28 and Ive never had healing problems before (did my nose the third time lol) complications didn‘t occur during the surgery and my surgeon said that none of his patients lost as much hair as I did. I guess if you‘re already prone to it cuz u got it in ur genetics, chances u will lose a lot of hair is bigger. Since you told me u have similar hair like me, I would be careful! My surgeon went too far to my face on my right side, so it will be probably difficult to hide the scar cuz it spread apart. I will however maybe get a scar-surgery where they just make the scar smaller and less visible in a year or two. I wouldnt want to transplant hair cuz theres going to be another incision with risking my hair to fall even more so there would be one problem solver and another is created.
</p>
<p>
I don‘t really know it I would do it again to be fair, because feeling is very important to me too, despite the looks. And I think I wouldnt necessarily needed the chin surgery in order to pass. So one should think about it well, because just because something looks good it doesnt need to feel good aswell.
</p>
<p>
I am wishing you good luck and good health for your upcoming surgery in a year ❤️

If you get a scar along the hairline is not great either.

Yeah FFS is major surgery. I had drastic hair loss plus the top of my head is still numb after 2 years so it&#39;s probably permanent.
</p>
<p>
At least you can get a hair transplant to cover up the scar after everything has healed well enough. My scar stretched as well but because it was along my hairline it looked worse than yours. I&#39;m very glad it&#39;s not visible anymore but the months between FFS and hair transplant sucked

Im sorry you had a huge struggle, too :( i know its not easy, not only physically but also mentally. Its scary how many times one has to proceed more follow-up surgeries. May I ask, didn‘t you experience more hair loss after the hair transplant on the incision behind ur head? I‘d be scared of that since Im already prone to it, so I will probably just get the scar done again

Did you have any issues getting transplants to grow in the thinned areas of the scar or scalp?

Yes these are some of the rough reasons where at my age (38) its not clear to me if FFS is actually worth the visual improvement to my face, at the risk of long term (or permanent damage) to my scalp and hair, or a forehead scar.  I both have very fine hair AND scar very easily .
</p>
<p>
I remember you posting your original concerns of hair loss post surgery.  And its pretty scary because your current pictures still show considerable thinness compared to what someone might expect post healing.  Your face is absolutely beautiful, but I can&#39;t imagine how frustrated you are since healing from this apparently can be VERY slow.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing your experience with this over the last few months!

Id definitely recommend you thinking about it well before making the decision as u mentioned you scare easily and your hair is rather fine, too. My hair was and still is very important to me, I still dont feel complete. So its a question when this journey will end. But if I get the scar/incision fixed, Im definitely done with any cosmetic procedure.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your kind words, Im glad I could help a lil bit!  xxx

The nerves in the face are really sensitive so any cosmetic surgery there is gonna change that around. They lock up and can for years, using a tissue paper run it around on your numb parts. Do it a few times a day. You need to remind your nerves what it is to feel, it&#39;ll feel bad but don&#39;t stop doing it. 5 minutes a few times a day, you&#39;ll get feeling back I&#39;m sure. As for the scar hair doesn&#39;t grow on scars, I would recommend looking into wigs if you want to fix that.

FFS is def. Major surgery. More than 6 years after the fact I still have numbness of my jaw, nose and forehead. At this point I wonder (and have doubts) that it will ever resolve.

Thanks for posting. Is there a reason you don&#39;t want to share the name of your surgeon/clinic?
</p>
<p>
As is, you are somewhat generalising the practice.
