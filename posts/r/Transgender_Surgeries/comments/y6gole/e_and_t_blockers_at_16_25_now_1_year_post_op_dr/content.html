I was going to go to Dr. Ting @ Sinai but I’d heard some bad things. Is this the same Dr. Ting? Did you get a PPT method? Did they have you do hair removal?

He does amazing work! Just everything else about him is ehh. He’s super busy all the time. I might’ve pissed him off too by being very anal and annoying about things. But I’ve seen my other girls in different states and they just don’t compare. He’s very good at making it look cis. They do the laser at one if they’re branches. It’s a requirement for him. Very painful but u can take breaks and breathers. Nothing about this is going to be easy! So get ready for the ride babe. In the end it’ll change your life if this is actually what u need in your life. Don’t have expectations everyone’s different, everyone heals different. Just buckle up for the journey and pray everything goes right! Good luck my love

yes. most GRS surgeons nowadays can create something that looks like any cis vulva. most people can&#39;t tell the difference (and usually when people say they can tell a difference, they have prior knowledge that it is a neo vagina, rather than a natal vagina)

It’s very close, if I got naked In front of my girls which I  have.  I can notice something different but to a small degree, the scaring is the problem and my clit also healed and fused alil weird on the outside. Nothing a revision can’t solve. I’m happy 7-10 with it. My surgeon blessed me.

As someone who&#39;s seen plenty of cis vulvas (and isn&#39;t cis but has a natal vulva), there&#39;s enough natural variance among them that this isn&#39;t a ridiculous thing to say at all. The only thing that stands out to me at all is the scarring, and some cis women get injured and/or have genital surgery, so it&#39;s not like you would never see that on a cis woman&#39;s vulva, even if it were a little more unusual. Besides, we all know that the scarring will likely continue to fade with time.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think a trans woman&#39;s vulva has to &#34;look cis&#34; to be real or beautiful by any means, but as far as I&#39;m concerned this could totally be a cis woman&#39;s vulva.

Am female, born with a vulva. Can confirm. I probably wouldn&#39;t have guessed if it wasn&#39;t clearly stated.

If you don’t mind me asking, do you have to do anything specific for stealth sex (have hair, not let ppl go down on you, etc.)? And what led to your vulva being clocked once? I’m thinking of doing that when I’m a bit more healed

I have a cis vagina, make pervy art as o e of the things I do for a living (viva anatomy!), and a mom of 5 whom is VERY bisexual.
</p>
<p>
This looks very much like many&#39;a cis vagina, and if you&#39;re a guy, I wonder how many you&#39;ve seen that weren&#39;t somehow crooked or wrong aside from porn.
</p>
<p>
Vaginas look all kinds of different ways naturally. Bruh. I&#39;m sorry she doesn&#39;t look exactly like your one girlfriend...? Or did you just...never pay that much attention to the vagina? Men who can&#39;t find the clit often don&#39;t really get a great look at the vagina as a whole; considering how painfully easy it is to find. It&#39;s HOPEFULLY the only gd hardened LUMP down there.
</p>
<p>
Vaginas are often lopsided in some way, rarely symmetrical. Hell, faces aren&#39;t even symmetrical. Sometimes, one side&#39;s inner lips are a solid, noticeable inch longer than the other. Other times, they&#39;re so long they hang away from the outter lips. And no--this doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s loose.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s not get into the weird ways penises can look, shall we?
</p>
<p>
(Edited to dish some more real life on this...person.)

While I agree with you that vaginas and vulvas can look a ton of different ways, I would caution you against assuming that someone with a feminine-presenting avatar in a subreddit for trans people is a man. I don&#39;t agree with what she said either and think it was in poor taste, but that&#39;s a pretty fraught assumption for you to make in this space. I hope you&#39;ll consider why.

I really sorry, but I don&#39;t gaf. 1. I said &#34;if you&#39;re a guy&#34;. 2. If someone doesn&#39;t know these things and pops off with things like that, they have NO business commenting where their words could do some SERIOUS damage. That, or they were a bigot/etc and I&#39;m glad they met with me, and no one else had to deal with them before almost -100 drove them to delete. ...I was being nice.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re asking me to be especially considerate to someone who was blatantly homophobic, closed-minded, hurtful, and offensive with what they said to the point of deleting it once I answered.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I don&#39;t mean to be bitchy--this rubbed me bad--but did you see/read the original comment with this white knighting, Hun? I can&#39;t help but think of someone like you who seems to be kind and have a big heart, would defend that.

Will be going back for scar revision and some laser sessions to reduce texture and scarring . 2 options cause I deff ripped it doing to much when I was first healing. Shoulda laid my ass in bed. It’s only not passed once! Never had any issues.

Hey, it&#39;s all good! I have some of that as well. Definitely go for laser scar ablation. That&#39;s a very smart move.

Wow what a nice thing of you to say given your direct experience with my vagina! What makes you say that? It&#39;s so very clear having seen both that they are structured in the same way.

Sorry I read that as u we’re having surgery in 5 months not that you were post op 5 months. Not trying to be rude or hurt you sorry if I offended you. In my opinion I’ve seen her work it’s similar to ting but obviously ting is the master next to Wittenberg atleast in this country. Ava’s is trained under him so I will say it’s good work. Trust me I’ve seen EVERYTHING. Before I put myself on that table.

You have amazing results I&#39;m glad that I chosen Dr Jess Ting for my Surgery! Can&#39;t wait for April 2023 for my new journey to begin! And those laser treatments at Mount Sinai hurts like Hell I have 4 more Sessions to go!

Good luck! Don’t think about the pain, don’t think about the end , enjoy every moment on your journey. It was definitely hard but possible. The pain meds will help the nerve meds will help. It’s not easy but when u are healed up it’s gonna be life changing
