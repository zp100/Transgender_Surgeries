</p>
<p>
Woops, skipped a couple weeks of updates...this post covers weeks 9, 10, and 11. There&#39;s no special stuff, just the same topics of swelling, dilation, healing.
</p>
<h1>
Swelling
</h1>
<p>
I don&#39;t think this has changed much, which is fine, because I don&#39;t notice in in everyday life. I guess from here on it&#39;s just the last bits of swelling that are slowly going away.
</p>
<h1>
Dilation
</h1>
<p>
I&#39;ve &#34;re-stretched&#34; things by now which is nice. I was only doing twice/daily for a week due to business and I could feel it get a bit harder to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Still on purple though! I figure I&#39;ll size up when I get back home in a couple weeks.
</p>
<h1>
Healing
</h1>
<p>
There&#39;s lots of nice pink peritoneal tissue in the mirror! Thankfully the granulation tissue never got too bad.
</p>
<p>
I actually haven&#39;t tried more intense exercise than hiking yet (cuz I&#39;m busy nowadays) so that&#39;ll have to wait till December as well.
</p>
<p>
Nerves are going a bit crazy sometimes, some feeling has came back in weird ways. There&#39;s places I can touch and random-ish nerves will just light up, like this spot at the top I can press and feel it all the way to the tip of my penis. I&#39;m assuming things will normalize but it&#39;s pretty fun(ny) for now.
</p>
<p>
The discharge/lubrication/whatever is
<em>
real
</em>
, folks. 24/7. It&#39;s definitely influenced by &#34;things&#34; but I&#39;m not sure what the factors are yet. I think being more active (e.g. when I hike) means more damp~wetness. Maybe also how hydrated I am. It&#39;ll be interesting to see the change when I go from dilating 3x/day to 1x/day...I had previously assumed that a significant portion of the discharge was leftover lube from dilating but TBH now I don&#39;t think so.
</p>
<h1>
Mental Health
</h1>
<p>
100% fine. Don&#39;t really think about it too much TBH, it&#39;s just a part of life now. And I&#39;m glad for it, especially since obviously 1) it hasn&#39;t healed all the way 2) I haven&#39;t had the part 2 (labiaplasty) yet. But even if nothing else happened I wouldn&#39;t regret it.
</p>
<h1>
Future Things
</h1>
<p>
I&#39;m having my 3-month post-op checkup soon, where I&#39;ll schedule my labiaplasty!! Excited.
</p>
<p>
Also I&#39;ve tentatively decided that I will post pics after the labiaplasty, so y&#39;all have that to look forward to.

Hi I’ve been lurking on your posts for awhile now. I was wondering if I could have the names of the other two surgeons doing nb surgeries. Unfortunately I’m on the other side of the country and my insurance isn’t accepted by Dr. Heidi Wittenberg. Thank you in advance.

Unfortunately I don&#39;t really know who they are as Dr. Wittenberg was the only person I talked to about it. I think I&#39;ve heard that a different California surgeon might do it too but I don&#39;t remember the name. Maybe try the Mt. Sinai team, since they&#39;re doing cool GCS stuff?

Definitely Dr Satterwhite in California, and supposedly Dr Crane in I think Austin Texas offer this or a similar option. I think Dr Wittenberg may be the only surgeon of the three to offer it in combination with peritoneal pull through at this time.

Oh my God, this exists?! I was told it didn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to check out your posts. Thank you for recording this experience!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious the impact to prostate stimulation (right now I can orgasm from perinium pressure/anal, and wouldn&#39;t want to loose that pleasure source... It really helps me feel femme at the moment).
</p>
<p>
OMG. So excite. Ty!!
