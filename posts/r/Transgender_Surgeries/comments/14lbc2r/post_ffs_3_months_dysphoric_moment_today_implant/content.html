I have never heard of a forehead implant.  I can see the minor transition you&#39;re referring to but I&#39;d be unlikely to notice it in passing.  Overall it creates a very nice improvement over your pre-op profile.   I recall Dr O being very suspect of cranial implants and their likelihood of infection.   I would ordinarily suggest that you not unzip it again and maybe see if the edge can be camouflaged with fat grafting.  However if you&#39;re certain you have a mucocele growing, it will require surgical removal.  I had one also and IME they don&#39;t magically resolve.  They just keep growing.   I recall an old product called Bone Source, not sure if it is still marketed or not.  It&#39;s a permanent bone paste that can be shaped.  If you must be unzipped that could maybe be used.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately I&#39;d be looking for the least invasive solution possible if it were me.  A second hairline incision can scar badly.  Ask me how I know.  And if the implant becomes infected it will require removal.  Resist the temptation to rub on a mucocele growth because it can spread infectious material around if broken up.

Hey everyone!
</p>
<p>
3 months post FFS.
</p>
<p>
Happy most days, but still have moments of dysphoria, and some concerns about my healing/results.
</p>
<p>
I cis-passed for the first time so that speaks to the results.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having a dysphoric moment today, so please hear me out on my concerns.
</p>
<p>
Round 2 of FFS is in the cards, so-to-speak and i&#39;m trying to evaluate what I might like revised, if anything, and what I might want in addition to the Type 3 forehead, custom implant, rhino, and chin that I had done. Also this is a sounding board. Am I hallucinating or do you see it too?
</p>
<p>
Additional link of facial video: front, profile etc. It&#39;s somehow just different in video than photo.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/8lGW3uTKJ9w?feature=share">https://youtube.com/shorts/8lGW3uTKJ9w?feature=share</a>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Concern number 1.
</p>
<p>
My custom forehead implant. I&#39;ve spoken with the surgeon about this, but i&#39;m in a waiting period currently before any action can be taken. My issue is the implant doesn&#39;t sit quite symmetrically flush. My OG forehead was flat in the middle, now it has what looks like a dent/lip off the edge of the implant, in the center, and leading down over my left eyebrow, while above my right eyebrow protrude in comparison. It&#39;s mostly visible under top down lighting, but it bothers me. I had an air bubble issue, so some sinus tissue could have began to grow outside of the forehead sinus, adding to the uneven appearance.
</p>
<p>
Concern 2:
</p>
<p>
My orbitals. Had them contoured in round one. They were very strong pre-ffs. I feel like the improvement was good. But I wonder still if maybe they were not reduced quite enough? They still protrude down over my lid crease from certain angles. Mainly profile and 3/4, especially when my chin is down ever so slightly.
</p>
<p>
Concern 3:
</p>
<p>
My Chin. I like it, but can&#39;t help but wonder if I went too subtle. It doesn&#39;t feel that swollen anymore tbh.
</p>
<p>
Concern 4:
</p>
<p>
Jaw. No work done, but discussed doing some in round 2.
</p>
<p>
How serious is tissue laxity with jaw work?
</p>
<p>
Is my edit unrealistic on the jaw, in terms of tissue tightness with that level of reduction?
</p>
<p>
My jaw is fine for me front and 3/4, it&#39;s just the back angles that bother me on a particularly dysphoric day.
</p>
<p>
If tissue laxity is awful, I may just have to get over my jaw issue. It doesn&#39;t bother me all the time, but it bothers me alot on dysphoric days.
</p>
<p>
Concern 5:
</p>
<p>
Cheeks. My apples have always been hollow. I have filler there, but discussed dissolving and use of custom submalar implants for round 2. I only want them to balance the submalar projection and decrease the look of mid-face hollowness that my face leans naturally towards. I feel a fuller cheek would help make my upper third look further recessed in comparison as well.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively fat-transfer, caveat being that i&#39;m very active and naturally slim, surgeon concerned the new fat will just be eaten by my metabolism, which is obviously, for me, a waste of time, and money.
</p>
<p>
Slim, active girls with successful, long lasting fat transfer please let me know!
</p>
<p>
Concern 6:
</p>
<p>
Lips. Filled as well. Top lip naturally non-existent. I&#39;d like a lip lift,  so I can be less reliant on annual filler. No other concern really.
</p>
<p>
Concern 7:
</p>
<p>
Not entirely relevant right now, but hairline after face is sorted.
</p>
<p>
Does my edit seem realistic?
</p>
<p>
How&#39;s my face now?
</p>
<p>
I feel from pre- to post FFS the change is pretty good. But I do still wonder if it was enough at times.
</p>
<p>
Also I appreciate 3 months isn&#39;t alot of time in the healing process, but I have to ask this anyhow.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for all the support so far, I couldn&#39;t have got this far without you x

I know this is a place for constructive criticism, but I only stop scrolling here a moment ago thinking &#34;I wish I looked as stunning as that beauty&#34;- only THEN did I read the post itself.

You do you, but I think you look amazing, honey.

In the spirit of the post, might i recommend only

See that’s the thing you’re very beautiful and to me look more like a model than most of the posts on here. Sometimes maybe having a more female face w androgynous features isn’t bad?

What are your concerns? I can’t really work out from the captions. The hair transplant you suggested in the edit is very realistic

I&#39;m a similar timeframe out from FFS and similarly worrying about if i did enough etc. It&#39;s rough, but I keep trying to remind myself to just wait and give it some time before I make any further decisions.  It really does all take a long time to heal.  I think you look great and definitely pass.  Personally,  I like your chin and jawline a lot.
</p>
<p>
I do see the slight line across part of your forehead, but there&#39;s probably still some swelling so I&#39;d talk to your surgeon but maybe give it more time (3 - 6 more months?) to see if it settles, especially if the surgeon isn&#39;t concerned?  I&#39;d see what the surgeon says though bc i don&#39;t know how implants in that area heal... If it does end up being a problem, you can get it removed and at that point do other stuff when they&#39;re opening you up again anyway lol.
</p>
<p>
I also think your eye area almost  certainly is still healing by the way.  The swelling that persists after the first month is really hard to notice and not as obviously squishy but there&#39;s definitely still healing happening which is why people say it takes a year to see final results from almost all these procedures.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;d trust your gut if something is really bothering you (think about how long it&#39;s been bothering you for, too), but I&#39;d also try to give it some time.  Speaking from my own current struggles, once you open pandora&#39;s box and start feeling like you get to decide what you look like it&#39;s tempting to do everything and to really fixate on stuff, but at the end of the day you&#39;re always going to be you and past a certain point you just have to learn to love yourself as you are.  It&#39;s a balancing act, and so the main thing is i&#39;d just try to be patient and give yourself some time even as you explore what other options are out there.  (Easier said than done since I&#39;m struggling with very similar feelings lol, but looking at you from the outside I think you look great and so it&#39;s helping me have perspective).

FWIW i did do some hair grafting to fill my temples though bc that&#39;s something I&#39;d wanted since the start of transition.  I&#39;m glad I did it but it was a more emotionally intense recovery than I expected - especially after two prior rounds of FFS close together, there&#39;s some real burn out potential.  So that&#39;s an easy one to do at some point if you want it, but I&#39;d probably give yourself some time.  If there is any chance you might re-open your forehead, too, I&#39;d wait because then you can use the hair grafting to cover any additional scarring from the next round.
</p>
<p>
You also want to leave at least 6 months after hair grafting before any more surgery in those areas so you don&#39;t disrupt the blood supply, and be sure to be at least 3 months after any surgeries so the blood supply has recovered before the grafting happens (per my doctor).

Thankyou, I think you&#39;re right, I have to give it more time. Most days lately i&#39;ve been fine, but the day I wrote this was a weird one. I think to some degree i&#39;m getting lost in areas that are still healing, and also lost in other areas that were untouched, but may not really require anything to feminise, but that may just be suffering the regular effects of aging (cheek apples, etc.)
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard being patient now that my brain recognises this face as my own, but I guess i&#39;ll just have to wait and focus on sorting the rest of my life out...lol

Honestly i would recommend you find a knowledgeable ffs surgeon to consult with or maybe someone gender-affirming/kind who specializes in female hair transplants.  It’s hard to say what you need without photos but you may not really need the hairline advance.  I didn’t.  Virtualffs has a good explanation on their website.  Personally, I’d say you can just get another hair grafting probably to avoid more scarring… the only reason they do the hairline advance surgically is if they’re already opening up your forehead for other stuff as far as I know… i’ve never heard of it being done independently, though i guess maybe they could or could combine with other kinds of things like a brow lift.  But if you already saw facialteam and they did forehead stuff via coronal, i doubt you need anything else right now.  I’d just wait for it to heal and do a little more hair grafting if you decide you really need more coverage or something… but make sure you go to an expert bc just lowering it arbitrarily or doing it wrong can look pretty weird, so you want someone who knows how to make a female hairline look natural.

Girl seriously you are super cute, everything looks natural. Dysphoria can be intense sometimes.
</p>
<p>
I think a hair transplant would look great on you but it&#39;s not going to make the dysphoria 100% go away, nothing can do that but self-confidence.
</p>
<p>
I went for a subtle hair transplant after my FFS, it&#39;s nice to just have more hair to add volume to ur cranial top as well as rounding the forehead. I really would not recommend more FFS it taxes your body a lot. However, if there is a real medical issue than that is another issue. Definitely agree with everything
<a href="/u/srs_time">u/srs_time</a>
said. Ultimately it&#39;s your decision but surgery is brutal and doing many of them will tire out your body and add even more long recoveries.
</p>
<p>
I think it sounds like you have a good aesthetic grasp so trust urself. I like the idea of hair transplant and lip lift from an aesthetic perspective. I don&#39;t think I would want to open up my nose again for the lip lift tho, IMO. I also don&#39;t think orbital contour gives that much bang-for-your-buck, there are less invasive solutions like couple units of botox. Orbital mostly looks good right after but it can sag over time.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your journey!

For me is the hollowness of the face that give away, as cis women are tend to have much more fat on their face.

I appreciate your advice.
</p>
<p>
Lid filler does interest me.
</p>
<p>
I have to disagree completely with what you did to my chin in your morph. That kind of chin does not suit my look. I&#39;d need a vastly different bone structure and facial length to suit that kind of chin. Chin projection is not a concern for me. I do appreciate your input though.

At the moment you have a chin that is neither here nor there. attractive chins on western faces have a square (flat) base and tapered sides. Your chin currently looks like it has filler in the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Also regarding the further supra orbital shave. You can set back the orbitals until the bone is 1mm thick. In your case because of soft tissue they will always look prominent. The issue isnt projection. Its the fact that your supra orbital region is not low. If you look at your CT scan they likely sit very high up.
</p>
<p>
I know this because I design custom implants for a living so Ive seen hundreds of faces and skulls so have a decent idea of skeletal base.

Let&#39;s leave assumptions of ethnicity out of this. I&#39;ve been asked where I come from in my own home country, and had all sorts of assumptions made. I see the appeal of the chin you&#39;re talking about, but not on my face. I feel that type of chin would masculinise my face. I also feel it would throw the balance of my facial thirds further out of alignment, requiring much more extensive work to be done to bring them back into alignment, and ultimately i&#39;d likely still have a long face at the end of it. My face looks long on it&#39;s own, but in proportion to my body, it&#39;s fine as it is.
</p>
<p>
It probably looks puffy because I&#39;m only 3 months out from Chin work and there is still swelling that comes and goes at times.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t doubt you know what your&#39;e talking about, but I feel we have a different view of what&#39;s attractive.

There’s no assuming to be made regarding ethnicity so don’t presume any discrimination. You have a western face. You aren’t Asian or of African descent clearly by your skull.

First of all, you are beautiful!
</p>
<p>
I see the indention on your forehead, but maybe you can ask your doctor first if that could be fixed with fat transfer.

I have prominent cheek bones and they give me most of my dysphoria even 7 years after. People never tell me the truth they see, so I avoid asking them because it has no sense anymore. When people can not be sincere, then is the worst.
</p>
<p>
I see your case is similar. Your profile is amazing but the front view makes me think about the cheek bones again. It gives me a feeling of male looking. I cannot be sincere enough, because you need real feedback.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon told me to not touch those bones because they are a typical female trait,  and because there&#39;s a risk of damaging the facial nerve,  etc.

Yeah I get what you&#39;re saying, about the zygomatic arch. The outer boney protrusion at the edge of the cheek. I&#39;ve kinda played around editing my face to remove that and I hated it. It suits some girls, but it only lengthened the look of my face more by reducing the width of the mid face. So I&#39;m good. My issue is the hollowness I get in the central area of my cheeks. Also, cis women pay alot of money to replicate those archs, and I got them for free. I think a way to reduce the appearance is some subtle filler or fat transfer to the surrounding areas, to round out and mask the zygomatic arch. But only very subtly or it&#39;ll look strange.

Exactly that!  That hollowness is what pisses me most.
</p>
<p>
Yes, the surgeon told me that some women try to emphasize those bones creating a shadow in the cheeks. I wanted to get rid of them at all costs Haha
</p>
<p>
But in our case they look kinda aggressive, only in the front view.  Some fillers every 6 months I think should work well.  Keep us updated,  you&#39;re beautiful girl,  smile more,  you did an incredible jawdropping change!
</p>
<p>
PS: also fillers in the temples can be a good thing.
