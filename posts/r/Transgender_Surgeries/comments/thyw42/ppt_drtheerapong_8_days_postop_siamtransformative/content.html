So finally I was discharged yesterday from hospital and I am back to my apartment
</p>
<p>
This is my first week experience:
</p>
<p>
I got hospitalised the day before and had blood test, chest x-rays and 2 enemas( one in the night one as the next morning), they are a bit unpleasant when they fill you up like you feel you are gonna poop all over, but when you go bathroom it is so relieving and you will feel so flat üòå
</p>
<p>
SURGERY DAY I got my IV preparation early in the morning after enema and it was a bit unpleasant especially when they put two different liquids at the same time I felt like burning in my vein. Surgery was performed at 2pm as doctor prefer to work during the afternoon/evening and he sleep all the morning (like a real artist lol). I was super nervous as usual, very scared of pain and regrets. In the operating room I meet the anesthesiologist and they prepared me with oxygen etc Doctor came talk with me with the vulvas pictures I provide him and told me what result to expect then anesthesiologist told me she will press the piston and that&#39;s it. I didn&#39;t even feel like sleeping or closing my eyes, I was just looking at the light on the roof and when I looked away BAM I was in another place and 8hrs later.
</p>
<p>
Pain started immediately and I was given morphine but I vomited right after waking up, very awful as my abdomen hurted a lot.
</p>
<p>
After few blinks I was in my room where they attached me pressure control on my legs to keep blood circulation normal level.
</p>
<p>
HOSPITAL STAY This is the worst part of the experience even worse than pain itself, a complete nightmare. fortunately thank to SIAMTRANSFORMATIVE I got a personal nurse with me 24/7 that massages me everytime I want and interact with hospital staff (they only speaks Thai so she was also a translator). The first 3 days were okay as I was constantly under morphine (injection every 4-6 hours) and no need to eat or anything. I can&#39;t feel anything down there neither catheter. Then after 3 days no more morphine and it becomes the nightmare. FOOD WAS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE and you have to eat if you want to take oral medicine but Tramadol will make your stomach lazy so everything is going to be fucked up.
<br>
I asked for nausea medicine and they worked a bit but main problems was eating without any chance to move arroud. THE WORST PAIN OF ALL THIS EXPERIENCE has been laying down on my back all the time, still have flashes of that.
</p>
<p>
after 6 days I was released, catheter remotion doesn&#39;t hurt it feels just like you are peeing hot and external stitches feel like plucking face hair a bit
</p>
<p>
AFTERCARE PACKAGE Siamtransformative are amazing, Cherry is a super Pro removing stitches despite my clit is super very sensitive I can&#39;t barely feel anything when she take out stitches. First dilatation hurted like cramps because I was in the wrong position, if you manage to stay 50/60¬∞ in your bed you will not feel anything, just a light pressure like you have to poop (my gf confirmed that it feel like this sometimes). Now after 8 days I just need paracetamol before dilatating and before going to bed, Tramadol will make me sick, lazy and nasty but now I need to be active and eat.
</p>
<p>
I have pooped 4 times before unpacking at the hospital but now I started real food I am having a bit issues because I can&#39;t push too much...... cherry told me is normal and to wait, will se, we hope ü§û (idk how Imgur works, I have pictures to upload but idk how to do)

<p>
Small thing I want to add to the write-up for people who had laparoscopic surgery before:
</p>
<p>
I had a laparoscopic appendectomy 3 years prior and Dr. Thee said that it was difficult, bit his team was able to reuse both bigger scars I already had for the biggest incisions and I they only added two very very minor new incisions on my belly. They are small enough that I think they&#39;ll get close to fade almost completely like the third very small incision from my appendectomy did.
</p>
<p>
So I am very pleased that I will have no new additional scarring on my belly from this procedure.

Congrats!

I was operated around 4 months ago by the same doctor too.  I hope you recover faster than mee :D

As for the real food, try to have more fiber and drink more water. it generally helps.
