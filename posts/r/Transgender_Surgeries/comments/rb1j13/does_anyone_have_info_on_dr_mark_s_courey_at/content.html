I had trach shave with him in March of this year. I also consulted for VFS but couldn&#39;t take the time off work for voice rest (4-6 weeks iirc).
</p>
<p>
I am pretty happy with his work. I&#39;m 9 months post op and still see my scar because he made it lower down on my neck in a skin fold, which he said would hide the scar (and it may once it turns white), but in hindsight I wish I had insisted on the incision being higher up under the chin (I also had some slight scar adhesion but lots of massage has made this not an issue). Happy to answer any questions!

He said he took off as much as he possibly could without damaging my vocal cords. He uses what I believe is the standard technique where they stick a very fine needle in to mark how far they can safely shave. I had no problems with voice loss or anything after.
</p>
<p>
Recovery was very easy, I showed up in the morning, procedure was less than an hour, and went home that afternoon (accompanied by my partner). they prescribed some codeine which I took day of and the day after surgery, but otherwise not much pain, just discomfort. I had surgery on a Thursday and started a new job on monday, so very easy recovery (although I did wear turtlenecks for a little bit).
</p>
<p>
The scar isn&#39;t bad, some days it&#39;s more visible than others, i believe eventually it will be pretty much invisible. As mentioned above, I wish it was under my chin instead of the front of my neck, but what can you do.
</p>
<p>
I still have a somewhat visible adams apple unfortunately, but I don&#39;t think that reflects on him as a surgeon,  I just had a fairly pronounced one to begin with and am skinny so it sticks out. But still it&#39;s much better than it used to be.
</p>
<p>
Here are 2 other people who went to him:

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b7t24o/i_had_voice_feminization_surgery_with_dr_courey/" rel="nofollow">2
</a>
</p>
<p>
The second person talks about being unhappy at 6 months with how visible the adams apple was but by a year out it was invisible, so I&#39;m crossing my fingers for that.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to dm me any other questions!

I had a trach shave with him this October. I&#39;m healing nicely and was very happy with the experience and the results. I was very concerned about damage to my voice since I&#39;m a trained singer, love to do impressions, may get into voice acting. He was very sensitive to this and gave me a great result and despite some hoarseness for a little bit (which has cleared up) I still have access to all the parts of my voice I had before.
</p>
<p>
My scar is still pretty visible since it&#39;s only been 2 months and I don&#39;t really have any natural folds to hide the incision in (recessed chin... my neck pretty much goes straight into my chin without a fold). But even now at 2 months it&#39;s easy to hide with makeup. I&#39;m not out to all my family and have made it through multiple gatherings without anyone noticing the scar.
</p>
<p>
Would recommend!
