Hey everyone!
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t really going to post this, and I&#39;m posting from a throwaway, because my surgical recovery and pictures of my genitalia are very private to me and I don&#39;t want them linked to me. That being said, I decided to write up and post as detailed of an account of my recovery from scrotectomy and orchiectomy as I could because I could not find
<strong>
<em>
anything
</em>
</strong>
online about scrotectomy, as it&#39;s a procedure that I don&#39;t think most people opt for. Hopefully this can be helpful to someone out there.
</p>
<p>
(Mods: if you&#39;re uncomfortable with throwaways, please DM me and I will send you the name of my main account.)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
Decision, consultation, and bureaucracy
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Scrotectomy is something I&#39;ve known I&#39;ve wanted for a very long time. I had dysphoria about my testes, but have no dysphoria about my penis and, in fact, quite enjoy having a penis and actively dislike the thought of having a vulva, vagina, or both, so any additional bottom surgery is off the table for me and I don&#39;t need the scrotal skin. I also have some significant neuroses and compulsions, and knew that keeping my scrotal skin after orchiectomy would be very negative for my mental health, especially before it tightened up and probably even after. Those are the reasons I opted for a scrotectomy; obviously, if you are considering vulvoplasty, vaginoplasty, or certain other procedures that use the scrotal skin after your orchiectomy, you will want to think long and hard about whether you want to include a scrotectomy with your orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
I had a consultation with Dr. Gladys Ng, a urologist at UCLA Health, in early September of this year. I was referred by my PCP, who is also in the gender health program at UCLA Health, and only had to wait about a month for the consultation. After some initial confusion over why I was there (my PCP&#39;s assistant seems to have made a mistake and wrote that I wanted vaginoplasty in the referral), we talked about orchiectomy and all its associated risks, benefits, etc. I raised the prospect of also doing a scrotectomy along with the procedure, and while she said she didn&#39;t do it very often, she was more than happy to do it if it was what I wanted and showed absolutely no resistance to the idea. She then explained the mechanics of that additional procedure - including drawing on me with a pen to show how the incisions would be made and to demonstrate why she needed to leave just a little bit of scrotal skin so that erections were still possible without stretching the skin painfully, which I found very useful - answered all the questions I had, and sent me on my way.
</p>
<p>
Less than a week later, her surgery scheduler called me and scheduled me for mid-November, just barely two months after my consultation. I already had a letter from my PCP and a letter from my therapist and sent them in right away, and her surgery scheduler called me a week later to ask if I could try to get a third letter from a psychiatrist because my insurance (Blue Shield of California) requires it. I was unable to get one within a few weeks, but Dr. Ng had a peer-to-peer conversation with an insurance company doctor and the procedure was approved without issue anyways.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-procedure and surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Because of the pandemic, I had to test negative for COVID-19 two days before my procedure or it would be rescheduled. There were some big issues getting my COVID test scheduled because Dr. Ng was very delayed in getting the order in, but her surgery scheduler (who, if you haven&#39;t gathered by now, was fantastic) made everything work about a week before the procedure and I had the test without issue. I also had a mandatory pre-operative appointment with my PCP about 10 days pre-procedure - I&#39;m not quite sure how this would have worked if you didn&#39;t have ready access to a PCP in that time frame, so that&#39;s something to be aware of with UCLA.
</p>
<p>
The night before my procedure, I got a call with my confirmed check-in time and had to start fasting for general anesthesia. The day of the procedure was fairly smooth, and I was in and out of the surgery center in about 5 hours. I had an issue with the EKG, for some reason, and at one point there were three anesthesiologists standing over me in the OR trying to figure out why they couldn&#39;t read my heartbeat - this delayed my start time by about an hour, and I was in the OR the whole time, which was a bit of a pain, but not the end of the world. (They ended up having to get another machine sent over from the hospital next door to fix it!)

</p>
<p>
Because I had declined painkillers beforehand due to having very bad reactions to opiates before and Dr. Ng saying they weren&#39;t necessary if I didn&#39;t want them, my girlfriend was able to collect me as soon as I woke up and brought me straight home.
</p>
<p>
Also, regarding cost: my insurance was billed roughly $13,000 in all for the procedure, facility fees, anesthesia, pre- and post-op appointments, and all other various costs. With my insurance, I was supposed to pay 20% coinsurance on all of those costs, but it actually only ended up being about $1,000 out-of-pocket for me for some reason.
</p>
<p>
So, how does the scrotectomy work? Well, as explained to me, Dr. Ng&#39;s method (I&#39;m not sure if this extends to other surgeons who do scrotectomies) is that she starts by doing an orchiectomy as normal. Once the testes are removed and the spermatic cords are severed, she gets to work on removing the scrotal skin. She does this by making an oval-shaped incision around
<em>
most
</em>
of the scrotal skin until it&#39;s removed, and then she brings that incision together and stitches it in a straight line. Even though the incision is oval-shaped, the resulting scar is a single, straight line that starts at the base of the penis and ends on the perineum, almost in the dead center of the body in my case. This procedure is, at the end of the day, fairly similar to orchiectomy, but removing the extra skin adds additional risk for some complications, especially that too much skin will be taken off and it will be too tight to have erections without pain. (This is why only
<em>
most
</em>
of the scrotal skin is taken off - just a little bit needs to be left to make sure this doesn&#39;t happen!)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery, complications, and results
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This was the seventh surgical procedure I&#39;ve had under general anesthesia in my life, in addition to five procedures under local anesthesia, and despite having all sorts of different procedures on different body parts with different levels of intensity in there, the recovery from this one was by far the easiest of any except a couple of the local procedures. I was still loopy from the anesthesia when I got home, but felt well enough to walk at a pretty normal pace on my own and was able to stand, dress myself, shower, and all that immediately. I worked from home the next day without issue, and didn&#39;t even need Advil to help with the (very minor, dull) pain in my groin. I was instructed not to drive for a week, and didn&#39;t, but felt like I could have without much issue if there had been some sort of emergency. As far as the actual instructions went: showers were okay, but no submersion until the wound was completely healed up; take Advil as necessary for the pain; don&#39;t drive for a week; no strenuous activities (including sex) for two weeks; and see her two weeks after my procedure for a post-op appointment. That&#39;s it!
</p>
<p>
That being said, I had two complications in my recovery from the procedure. The first occurred about a week after, when the swelling in my penis started
<em>
increasing
</em>
instead of going down as it was supposed to. It got pretty bad, and at its worst my penis was roughly double its normal size and had several spots that were severely swollen, even more than the rest of it. I called Dr. Ng&#39;s office at about 4pm, and she called me back at about 7pm. After talking, she told me she wanted to come into her clinic early the next morning to see me. She said that the complication most likely occurred because she took slightly more scrotal skin off than was ideal, and that the now-tightened skin was banding around the base of my penis, essentially creating a natural tourniquet that was preventing any fluid from draining out of my penis. The solution was to start bandaging my penis with gauze and compression tape, and three times per day, to massage the skin at the base of my penis fairly aggressively to loosen it up. I&#39;m sure it was nothing like dilation from vaginoplasty, but this
<strong>
<em>
hurt.
</em>
</strong>
Quite a lot, for the first several days. The pain started to lessen after a few days, though, and by about two weeks later, the massaging was painless. She also told me to have erections as frequently as possible to stretch the skin in that way as well, and, because of the tightness, erections were quite painful for about two weeks or so. The swelling still isn&#39;t completely gone five week post-surgery, but it&#39;s much, much more normal now, and there&#39;s no pain from skin tightness or erections at all anymore.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ng was telling me that, if massaging and erections didn&#39;t resolve the issue on their own, I would need an additional procedure to graft skin back to the area. She was never really concerned about this for me, though, and I wasn&#39;t either after the first few days of massaging loosened the skin a
<em>
lot.
</em>
(I also ended up avoiding this outcome, obviously.)
</p>

Another angle on the significant swelling that was supposed to have gone down by this point. The dark bruised spot on the right side of the base of my penis (left side in the image) was the most painful spot to massage when trying to loosen the skin.
</a>
</p>
<p>
The second complication was that some of the surgical glue that the wound was sealed with came off before the wound had actually healed (perhaps, she thinks, because I was even a little bit too aggressive with the massages). This left some surface-level open wounds in small areas, and after seeing her again in her clinic two weeks post-procedure, she told me that it wasn&#39;t a problem and it would heal normally as long as I was extremely careful to not get it infected. She told me to continue to shower only, no submersion, and to put over-the-counter antibiotic on it with a bandage if I did anything that might get it dirty (every time it got wet, after sex, etc.). I&#39;ve managed to avoid infection and it&#39;s almost completely healed up now, and the scar looks no worse for it.
</p>
<p>
All that being said - the recovery is pretty tough, from an emotional standpoint. I knew the moment I saw the swollen, bruised, two-hours-after-surgery results that I had made the right decision for myself, and I was extremely happy. But having such an emotionally-charged procedure, especially in the middle of a pandemic when I&#39;ve had lots of health issues in my life and with multiple complications (both of which looked kind of scary at first, too!), was an emotional whirlwind, and I was a wreck for several weeks. Be prepared to have a tough time emotionally, even with an easy recovery and even if you know that you&#39;re making the right decision.

You can still see some minor swelling on the penis, especially at the start of the incision (that bulge of skin at the base of the penis). This will continue to go down over time.

</p>
<p>
Aside from some difficulties with recovery that most people don&#39;t experience, and some bureaucratic difficulty getting Dr. Ng to put in my COVID test order, this was an incredibly easy experience, and I am
<em>
so
</em>
happy. I made the right decision without question, and would strongly recommend that anyone very strongly consider a scrotectomy if they think it might be right for them. I had a lot of concerns that I was making a mistake even though I felt very strongly that it was right for me, especially because I&#39;ve felt a lot of pressure on what kinds of surgery I &#34;should&#34; have, but they melted away as soon as I took those bandages off. I also highly recommend Dr. Ng - even if she created a little bit of a bureaucratic hassle for me with the COVID testing, it was more than made up for by how incredibly on-top of things her surgery scheduler Leo was, and by my fantastic results.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Gladys Ng, her surgery scheduler Leo, and UCLA Health in general were fantastic. I highly recommend doing orchiectomies and/or scrotectomies with her, especially if you&#39;re in Southern California!
</p>
<p>
Recovery is really easy as far as surgical recoveries go, and isn&#39;t too different from just an orchiectomy. However, you do introduce the risk of additional complications if you include a scrotectomy, especially the possibility that too much skin will be taken off and that you&#39;ll need to do painful re-stretching of the skin or, in extreme cases (not mine), need a revision where you get skin grafted back to the area.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer most questions people may have about the procedure, the process, the recovery, or even my decision-making process in including a scrotectomy - please comment on the post and I&#39;ll let you know what I can.

That&#39;s a great scrotectomy. It seems people who want the scrotum removed often have it done after healing from the orchi, usually by a plastic surgeon because they try to minimize scarring.

Congratulations!!! I had the same procedure, different place, at a similar time, and I second everything here. It was literally my exact experience except I came ready with 4 signatures on my WPATH letter. So no issues there. Hate BCBS!!!
</p>
<p>
You healed much cleaner/faster than me as I still have some scabbing and a little larger scars that I’m told will heal straight away in time and be fairly invisible. I had a trake shave done at the same time so a plastic surgeon did the entirety of the job which also complicated insurance as they didn’t want to pay her fee for an Orchi that could be done by a urologist. I paid the difference... no biggie... was worth not getting knocked out twice for...
</p>
<p>
Congratulations again!!
