As other folx say, VFS isn&#39;t great for singing tbh. I used to be a good singer and now my singing voice sucks and is pretty unreliable. This doesn&#39;t affect my speaking voice though.

I&#39;ve done some research and I know that with Yeson people have been able to sing in a higher register without going into falsetto, at least a bit. I haven&#39;t had any personal or internet interactions that have confirmed that, however. It&#39;s something I&#39;m very interested in because I&#39;m a performer, so I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll be able to sing at least okay after VFS.

VFS is bad for singing. You do lose a lot of range both on the lower and upper ends, and you can lose tone as well. VFS will generally NOT raise the high end of your upper range. And you will very likely lose volume, potentially a lot.
</p>
<p>
I just had surgery with Thomas...I was a very good amateur singer. it’s way too early too early to evaluate final results after four weeks, but I would not be surprised if my range ended up at 14-16 semitones. Before surgery, my range was about 27-29 semitones. Too early to evaluate volume, but would not be surprised if I lost 3-5 dB (which is actually a lot more than it sounds).

From Dr. Thomas&#39;s website (
<a href="https://www.voicedoctor.net/pitch/feminization-laryngoplasty/patient-information/patient-information">https://www.voicedoctor.net/pitch/feminization-laryngoplasty/patient-information/patient-information
</a>
) under &#34;Benefits&#34;:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Of 81 patients for whom I have both before and after recordings, the mean pitch elevation is six semi-tones with a standard deviation of 3 semi-tones. The lowest pitch is up seven semi-tones (s.d. = four semi-tones) and the highest pitch is down three semi-tones (s.d. = seven semitones). This review of these results remain in the process of being reviewed by a peer reviewed journal (1/29/2013).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that this statement is from over 6 years ago, however it still generally holds true. There are some exceptions (obviously.) Anecdotally, at 4 months post-op, I have (re)gained a few notes at the top end that I didn&#39;t have access to before surgery, but overall I still lost range. (I used to be able to go as low as D2 now I&#39;m only able to go down to G3, but on the other hand, I can hit F5 again (barely), where before I was lucky to hit A5.) In terms of volume, I&#39;m able to make myself heard, though the mechanics are different, and I don&#39;t have access to the same chest voice power that I did before. 4 weeks is very early recovery, and I definitely have way more volume now than I did at that point.

Ah... I really wish there were better research into this stuff. That’s sample size is way too small to draw meaningful conclusions from, even if the group were randomly selected, which it isn’t. :(

I disagree that it is impossible to draw conclusions from limited sample sizes. However, it is much harder to make broadly applicable statements.

Sure! One can draw lots of conclusions from such data.  Mostly incorrect or misleading ones, unfortunately ;)
</p>
<p>
Tbh, I’m pushing back here only because your original reply was stated as fact, but the data it’s based on doesn’t support such certainty.

Factually speaking, of the 81 patients for which he had before and after recordings as of 2013, he observed those results in terms of minimum and maximum pitches.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean that all possible patients will necessarily fall within those ranges? No, just that of those 81, they fell within those ranges. If you&#39;re a close demographic match with those 81 patients it would be reasonable to conclude that your result would likely be similar to theirs. If not, then those results may not be a good guide for your own personal outcome.
</p>
<p>
My personal results are also real. They are anecdotal, and may not apply to you personally, but they still happened.
</p>
<p>
Having listened to the before/after recordings on his website, I feel as though the patient&#39;s demographics are a major factor in the ultimate qualitative outcome.
</p>
<p>
Edit: You&#39;re right that the data doesn&#39;t support broad conclusions that all trans women can expect outcomes within those ranges, but I believe that trans women who are similar to the women he has data for can expect similar outcomes. I made my decision by listening to the before/after samples on his site, comparing their before voices with my own, and listening to the after voices to get a sense of what kind of change I could expect. I feel like my before/after difference is similar to what I expected.

I want this surgery but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s risky.. Are you satisfied? Do you recommend this surgery? I have the intuition that when a voice drop because of testosterone it&#39;s irreversible and I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m saying that to myself.. I&#39;m lost I don&#39;t know what to do.. Also can I hear an audio of your voice?

There are risks involved with any surgery. With this surgery in particular, there are risks to the vocal cords. You could potentially end up damaging your voice.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, yes, I am satisfied. My voice is naturally mine, without having to push to keep it bright and pitched up into the right range. This was my goal for surgery, regaining a few extra notes at the top of my range was a happy side effect. I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to make a blanket statement recommending any surgery, it really depends on what your needs / goals are. Have you tried training your voice? What is/isn&#39;t satisfactory about it? What do you hope to gain from surgery? etc.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re right that estrogen alone will not reverse the deepening of the voice due to testosterone. I would suggest doing some research on the subject of how the voice changes during puberty, and what the various voice surgery techniques do to offset / undo the changes to really answer this question.
</p>
<p>
My most recent voice sample is from about a month ago, and doesn&#39;t match well with my before sample. I&#39;ve been intending to do a proper before/after comparison, but haven&#39;t had the time yet. There are a few threads on
<a href="/r/transvoice" rel="nofollow">/r/transvoice
</a>
that have before/afters that you might look at in the meantime.

I have not tried and I will but I&#39;m so dysphoric of my voice she was way more beautiful before puberty.. And even though she&#39;s not so masculine even with training it would-be different, and I just want a natural voice, I don&#39;t want to force me and it&#39;s so stressful.. So I really think I need this surgery but what if Dr Thomas damage my voice.. I&#39;m scared :(( If we go with this surgery, do you think it&#39;s better not to have a tracheal shave before? Because I will have FFS next year

Voice training can be hard (and dysphoria inducing), but understanding how your voice works helps a lot. I found that I basically had to relearn how to speak after surgery, and the lessons I learned through training helped a lot. I&#39;m seeing a SLP on an ongoing basis, and her help has been invaluable.
</p>
<p>
You need to assess the balance of risks vs outcomes and decide if surgery is worth it for you. I&#39;m freaking out about bottom surgery at this point because I know the recovery is going to be tough and there are a couple of really scary potential complications (rectovaginal fistula, clitoral necrosis for example). Still going ahead with it because it&#39;s worth it to me.
</p>
<p>
If you go with a glottoplasty-based approach, then yes, you will need a separate tracheal shave. Some surgeons are able to do it at the same time. Make certain you understand how your FFS surgeon will protect your vocal cords. If you go with the FemLar approach, then no, you will not need it separately, it&#39;s part of the procedure.

No I&#39;m planning to go with Dr Thomas because a glottoplasty will not change the resonance.. Thanks a lot, I hope in 2021 I will get this surgery and I hope it will be a success.. 😔

I will do a post-op report in a couple months on
<a href="/r/transvoice" rel="nofollow">r/transvoice
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Very briefly, however, at five weeks post-op, I have had a fantastic increase in pitch, but still very soft, hoarse and breathy...still too early to tell about long-term results. It may take many months for me to recover and get a true sense of what I have ended up with.

Personally I know this isn&#39;t what you asked but if singing is important to you, you could always try to voice train before surgery and see if you can get a sound you&#39;re satisfied with. You actually will need to voice train a bit even with surgery to get the best sound out of it so it isn&#39;t wasted effort. I&#39;m about to post on
<a href="/r/asktransgender" rel="nofollow">/r/asktransgender
</a>
with a post on my voice just in case you want to check it out.

I’ve been training for a while and I think I’m getting close to a sound I’m okay with, but I just don’t like having access to that lower range, and I feel like my voice is always a little bit strained if I really want to sound feminine. I just want that extra little push to sounding natural. Idk, voice is really important to me.
