Im so excited I finally got my ffs I had tp share ðŸ˜Š The recovery is a bitch though lol... Slowly starting to feel better and very happy with the support from the doctor. Swelling should be peaking today and pain going down. I got jaw, nose, brows, and trachea shave. So excited to see how it turns out!!!

Dr Jumaily is good. He was the one that was supposed to fix what Bensimon did to me. The bill was going to be 36k.
</p>
<p>
Than I made the mistake to mention Jumailyâ€™s name to the lawyers of Bensimon. And now Jumaily doesnâ€™t respond to my email.
</p>
<p>
Such a good great world with honest people out there.

Hello! Congratulations on the surgery :) i actually had some questions since I&#39;m going for it in 2 months!
</p>
<p>
1) I work from home on my laptop and I&#39;m wondering how many days I should call off. As long as I&#39;m able to answer emails and work on documents, I can say I&#39;m working. How long did it take you in recovery before you could do that again?
</p>
<p>
2) Do you have numbness in your lower face?
</p>
<p>
3) What are you able to eat?
</p>
<p>
4) How long was your surgery?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it! Thank you so much for taking the time to at least read this! Much love and good luck on recovery!
</p>

My surgery took about 8 hours. I went in at 6 am and woke up a few hours after surgery like 6 or 7 pm so pretty much the whole day!
</p>
<p>
The day after I had some gatorade and a few bites of soup, this morning I am able to eat applesauce. Its hard to shew anything due to the pain in my jaw. Definitely some numbness too! It varies from numbness to pain throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your surgery as well! ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
I took two weeks off of work since I work in person. Im on the second day after and my eyes are too swollen for me to want to be on my laptop, but its probably doable either tnight or tomorrow!

Would you be able to send me a before and after of your nose? Maybe the jaw too if you feel comfortable because those are my main concerns. I havenâ€™t seen enough before and after pics from him
