I once read an article of a trans woman who fully fucked up her vagina and had to get a revision because she wasn&#39;t patient enough and tried to rush recovery and move around faster than her body was able to.
</p>
<p>
Be patient because the alternative is much worse.

I pretty much spent 2 months in bed with maybe 10 minutes of sitting, unless I had to go somewhere.  Dr Sutin does good work, his stitches are very fine, and I know of a few girls who had a stitch or two need fixing.
</p>
<p>
I remember at week 5 I was focussed on everything, it was an obsession, but believe me, it gets better, at 7 months I‚Äôve forgotten a lot of what I had to deal with and the times spent laying down when I desperately wanted to sit up.
</p>
<p>
I asked him probably daily about an issue I had with things looking not right, and him saying be patient, looks good.  But it‚Äôs wrong I would say‚Ä¶. But ummm‚Ä¶ he was right.

Oh my goodness, this is so similar to my experience, totally the same! Thanks for the comment, it sounds like we really do need to be more patient and calm. And trust the process! üôåüèª

the last weeks of being bedbound were the worst for me. being stuck in bed all day took significantly more of a mental toll than i anticipated.
</p>
<p>
i remember letting go and crying just because i wanted to go for a walk outside and i couldn‚Äôt.  i would just say: it‚Äôs okay to treat this like a serious challenge and give yourself space to feel bad about it and trust that you will overcome it in the end.
</p>
<p>
those feelings went away for me as soon as i was able to routinely go on walks. hang in there!! it will be better soon üíú

Yes, I see your point, I feel much better when I get up and walk somewhere outside my room, it makes a big difference! üôèüèª  Thanks for the support, I‚Äôm really looking forward to the swelling going down and the wounds healing so I can be more active.

That&#39;s a long time, I really wonder about some of these surgeons and their techniques, I was done by the National health service in the UK, I was walking about fine the next week after release from hospital (was in for 6 days) and drove my car and a motorcycle ( just to the shops, not far) in the second week after release , managed a 6 mile pub crawl along the Thames in London at around the 8 week mark, ( everybody should do this! important historical pubs everywhere.).

Yeah these people talking about not moving for months doesn&#39;t sound right... I haven&#39;t had the surgery yet, but the surgeon I&#39;m going to said his patients were usually walking around fine within 2 weeks.

I had PIV with Dr Bowers in the San Francisco Bay Area beginning of Sept, 2024. Her protocol is to be up and walking before you leave hospital on day three, that being mobile is really important for the recovery, that getting up and slowly walking around is important every day. Her advice is that wound separation is very common, it&#39;s nothing to worry about, just send her pictures. I got separation at the bottom of both of my labia, one side a lot more than the other and also a little at the very top of my incision on one side. The biggest issue I have is that for a while there it was stinging a lot when I&#39;m peeing as some would escape the stream and dribble back down my labia towards my anus. I had to deal with that for about two weeks and now it&#39;s pretty much stopped, the skin has healed itself.
</p>
<p>
I was freaking out about the separation too, but my friend who has already had a vaginoplasty said &#34;girl, that&#39;s nothing. I had separation worse than yours and now that it&#39;s healed it actually looks super natural and is prettier than the other labia!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Follow your surgeon&#39;s instructions, they&#39;re that way because the after-care matches their surgical technique. You don&#39;t have to have a porn star vagina, natal vaginas come in SO many different shapes and sizes, we trans ladies tend to obsess WAY too much about the appearance, you&#39;re going to be just fine. You&#39;ve got this.

Wound separation usually happens because of the surgeon technique, because there is too much tension on the incision .

I am also sutin patient, and I had a lot of wounds separating, just try to not open your legs very wide when setting or walking, I don‚Äôt think there is anything else you can do , he just does the incision with a lot of tension hence the wound separation and obvious scars with most of his patients.

Silvasorb hydrogel works wonders for wound recovery. You can also use Silver Nitrate swabs available on Amazon.

Dr. Sutin said to walk slowly, treat with Betadine and that it‚Äôs normal because the stitches have dissolved. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of my mobility yesterday.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt know if walking will make it worse. The hardest thing is that such surprises come unexpectedly, although it is already 5 weeks and I would like to walk and do some housework.
