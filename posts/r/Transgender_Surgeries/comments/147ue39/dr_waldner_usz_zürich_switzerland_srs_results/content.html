So glad to hear that! This is truly one of the better results I‚Äôve seen in terms of shape, and near total lack of visible scarring. Major congrats!

Damn thanks! In the pictures I already had my revision, during that surgery I had my scars redone next to some other things and I feel like it really helped.

Hi maybe you could add this to the wiki?

I made this post specifically to go into the wiki so the girls have some resources.

Thank you for sharing!  I‚Äôm really happy for the video, because you can never tell how it actually
<em>
moves
</em>
and
<em>
behaves
</em>
from a still shot.  Really frustrating to try and make a lifetime decision about a really intense procedure when you‚Äôre not sure how the tissues will actually ‚Äúperform‚Äù when stimulated.  Honestly, your vagina is very sexy but for me also informative, and for that I‚Äôm grateful.  Thanks!

I&#39;m glad it helps!! I agree with you that based on pictures alone it&#39;s sometimes hard to really get a sense of whats going on. I&#39;ll keep this post up, it&#39;s also in the wiki now and hopefully some girls will also post in the future. I understand that some of them probably don&#39;t post it because they aren&#39;t happy with the aesthetics (I wasn&#39;t either before my revision) so I thought maybe it helps to see like the fully finished product. I don&#39;t plan on surgery down there ever again.

My first surgery was pretty much botched by him so I agree. I mean it was functioning properly but aesthetically it definitely wasn&#39;t pretty. I even had regrets after the first surgery. I was very neglected when it came to post op care. So yeah I agree with you and even tho I am pretty happy now, I still wish there was a better surgeon in Switzerland. Some of the american results I see make me very depressed still because mine isn&#39;t the same. But yeah, after the second surgery I&#39;m happy with the result, just the entire process was the worst experience of my life. A big part of that is thanks the surgeon and the staff not taking proper care of me post op and not communicating at all. Even after the second surgery they didn&#39;t. Stay safe out there. Overall I am also happy I survived and I&#39;m happy I have a result that I can live with.

Thank youüòä yes I used to get laser hair removal on the regular a few years ago. Haven&#39;t had any hair removal in years though, it just grows in kind of sparse now. I didn&#39;t get any form of electrolysis beforehand either and the doc told me he&#39;d scrape the follicles off so there&#39;s no hair growing inside the entrance. So far no hair inside so I think i&#39;ll be good.

Thank you but please try not to compare yourself to others too much, it can be very harsh on your mental health, at least it was for me when I compared my results with others. I&#39;m so happy for you and I hope your life has been positively impacted!

Beautiful result! Would you recommend this surgeon in Switzerland looking back at your experience, now that it has been a few years? Do you think there may be a doctor who can offer even more aesthetics? Thank you for your feedback! P.S. is there constant lubrication via sigmoid or is that an exaggeration?
