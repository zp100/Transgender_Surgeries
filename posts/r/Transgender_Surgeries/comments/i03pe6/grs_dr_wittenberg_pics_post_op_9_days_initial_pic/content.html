<li>
Did you get PI or PPT?
</li>
<li>
If PPT, why did you decide to go with Wittenberg over other doctors (esp. Ting, BBL, and/or Avanessian) who also do peritoneal surgery?
</li>
<li>
How long did you have between the consult and surgery?
<br>
</li>
<li>
What was your overall experience with Dr. Wittenberg and her staff?
</li>
<li>
What didn&#39;t you ask at the consult that you should have?

PI minimal depth, about 2‚Äù is what I ended up with.  PPT is an option in the future with Wittenberg should I choose.
</p>
<p>
I had about 3 1/2 months between consult and surgery.
</p>
<p>
Dr. W and her staff are all AMAZING.  So kind, so wonderful, so friendly, so quick to reply to messages.  I have never gone more than an hour without a reply from someone in their office.
</p>
<p>
Can‚Äôt think of anything I didn‚Äôt ask at the consult that I should have or that I didn‚Äôt ask by follow up message that was responded to later.

What day would you say you were mostly ok on your own?  Can you dilate and clean up for it solo?
</p>
<p>
Was there anything she didn&#39;t say to get that you recommend?

I should say first that I got minimal depth, which for me, is about 2‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt need to dilate except with my finger once or twice a day for a minute or two.  So no biggie.  Don‚Äôt need a bunch of lube or anything.
</p>
<p>
Nothing that I needed that wasn‚Äôt suggested except food and snacks and an extension cord for reaching from the wall plug in hospital over to your bed for phone or iPad charger.
</p>
<p>
I was
<em>
sorta
</em>
ok making quick microwave food for myself or getting snacks and fruit or drinks for myself from the fridge on day 2 or 3.  I was supposed to be up and walking a few times a day anyway for a few minutes so I used those times for that, though I did have someone to care for me as well.
</p>
<p>
I can care for myself solo, though it is a whole new ballgame getting used to not being able to
<em>
SEE
</em>
anything, dammit, and really makes you appreciate how convenient a flexi-straw is. ü§£

Did she give you a shit ton of oxy too and how much did you need or still need?
</p>
<p>
I have a portable charger.  I&#39;m hoping to use that and be ok.
</p>
<p>
Did you have visitors? Were they strict about one person for just one hour during visiting hours only?  How long until you were released?

I am so lost about the flexi straw? Lol... I hope you don&#39;t mean our prolapsed urethra, lol

Lol.  Flexi-straw = convenience of an innie vs outie genital for purposes of certain things, all other things set aside.
</p>
<p>
I got enough Percocet to get me through the first week for sure, but not with ‚Äúshit tons‚Äù left over.  Don‚Äôt need it much anymore.  Hope not to at all.
</p>
<p>
I could have had a visitor for one hour during visitor hours but I didn‚Äôt.  I was only there 23 hours and my caregiver had just dropped me off prior to surgery like 4 hours earlier, and was 40 minutes away.  I was going to see them the next morning.  So I was fine.

Shit, I planned on staying at least two days, bc they said 2-4.  My ride isn&#39;t coming back until then, lol.
</p>
<p>
I have like a three month supply.  I took a Vicodin once, after a hernia operation, and lost my memory.  I&#39;m scared to death of Percocet.  I think I have issues around losing control of myself.
</p>
<p>
Did gabapentin help? Did you take it prior to surgery?  I have and it really relaxes me, and curious if you noticed any change.
</p>
<p>
Haha, I&#39;m so done with my straw.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a trip to not see anything, but I avoid looking at it already.

I can‚Äôt even imagine how or why you got a 3 month supply.  That sounds like an error or something.  Because that is not the way Dr. W normally seems to handle or think about the use of narcotic pain meds.  Be careful.

I am not taking anything I don&#39;t need.  I&#39;m taking half a dose, only if needed.
</p>
<p>
What do I do with the rest when I&#39;m done?  I checked again, it&#39;s a 6week supply at max dose.  Which is still way more than I could need.
</p>
<p>
I think she is conservative about refills.  Most patients aren&#39;t even using everything they&#39;re given, so she&#39;s trying to avoid causing an addiction, which to me makes sense.

Hard to day whether the gabapenton helped.  Might have.  Don‚Äôt know what it would have been like without it, to be honest.  I have taken ganapentin for a while for other reasons, and had actually JUST tapered down in time to ramp back up for this surgery.  Geez.  Now I gotta taper off again.  I am still curious to see what kind of nerve pain I might have in terms of ‚Äúshocks‚Äù as things start to reconnect more‚ÄîI‚Äôve had some of that already.  Most of the ‚Äúnerve pain‚Äù so far seems to be from my swollen clit that needs time to shrink down to size and not be big, bruised, purple, and under pressure.  That does hurt sometimes.  Not unbearable, but annoying and need some nsaid or Tylenol.  Rarely, some Percocet.

Except now we have two recent patients saying they&#39;ve been given more pain killers than they could possibly need.
</p>
<p>
That rumor about Dr Wittenberg came from one post.  Likely sh was an addict who lashed out at her doctor, which is very typical behavior.
</p>
<p>
Opioid addiction is a very tragic and serious issue.  I hope everyone is careful :)

This was from my own experience with Dr. Wittenberg as well as others, and I 100% promise you I was not &#34;exhibiting addict behavior&#34;; your insinuation to this effect is tbh pretty rude.

I don&#39;t remember who made the post.  I&#39;m not saying anything personally against anyone, sorry if that offended you.
</p>
<p>
However it does seem patients are getting a lot of very strong pain killers, more than they need, and I think that&#39;s a contradiction that should be noted.
</p>
<p>
Bc I seriously doubt she just gives more to some and less to others.  Something doesn&#39;t make sense and I don&#39;t know what other explanation besides some patients taking too much.

One is 9 days post op and mostly not taking them anymore
</p>
<p>
The other is close to her date I guess, and picked up her script.  Which she said was 6 weeks of Percocet if taking the full dose.
</p>
<p>
Percocets are really strong.  6 weeks is a long time post op.  That doesn&#39;t seem conservative to me, that seems moderate to generous, no?

Personally I&#39;d be extremely reluctant to go to a surgeon with a reputation for limiting painkillers like that. I&#39;d far rather have too much and not take them than the other way around. I trust myself with painkillers and I have a terrible pain tolerance.

Except multiple people are saying they have more than they need.

So maybe it&#39;s not a case of the doctor under prescribing.  At least for the average patient.

It‚Äôs not clear what‚Äôs  going on in this case, but it is one of my criteria for choosing a surgeon. It‚Äôs not overly common but some people go through a really bad time and I don‚Äôt want to risk being one of them if I can avoid it.

Very nice results!
</p>
<p>
I was just looking back at mine (I had mine 18 months ago) and yours look similar. I‚Äôm completely satisfied with my results.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes for quick healing!

Also, would you say you could climb one flight of stairs the day you were released from the hospital?

Yes, I could have.  Not TOO comfortably, but I think so.

I honestly don‚Äôt know, lol.  I‚Äôm not a surgeon and didn‚Äôt ask, so can‚Äôt help you, sorry!  I can only assume however she does it is how she expects will give her the best result at bringing skin edges together for least scarring and greatest healing in the long term.
