Hi there,
</p>
<p>
I had the above procedures with 2 Pass about 4 months ago. After the procedure I was very bruised and swollen which I knew was normal. I was in pain whenever I woke up which I thought was normal. I am not in much pain anymore except that I am still numb. But what&#39;s worrying is my eyes would go cross eyed at times and people point it out to me at times because it seems to happen when I move my eyes. My eyesight seems okay with slight blurring to my vision  but movement is off. I also have a bumpy area in the middle above my nose where the eyebrows are positioned in front of each other. What&#39;s going on? I&#39;m worried.
</p>

This guy is just bad news. Numbness is supposed to be temporary. A lot of people whoâ€™ve had surgery with him complain of permanent numbness which indicates permanent nerve damage. Heâ€™s sloppy and careless.
</p>
<p>
I had an online consultation with him and he immediately came off as a bad surgeon. Cold, careless and cash driven. He wanted me to book a surgery slot without an in-person evaluation, and he tried to charge me an exorbitant amount of money. That guy reeked of bad news.
</p>
<p>
Whenever someone develops problems like the ones youâ€™ve described above in your post, it maybe an indication of nerve damage. The bump could be anything, from bad bone work to a cyst. I would recommend that you consult with another surgeon in order to diagnose your problem accurately. I donâ€™t know about the laws in Belgium but if you have permanent damage from bad surgery, there maybe grounds for a malpractice suit.

Hi, I am very sad about your problem. There is another case reported here in Reddit that had a serious problem with the same surgeon from Belgium. Try to contact this person because she obligated this surgeon by law to make a revision suegery to try to solve the problem. One of the problem was a bump in the forehead. I hope your problem is not anything serious but be aware to demand your rights. Very very good luck.

OMG I&#39;m really terrified now. I think I have a similar issue. I definitely don&#39;t want a revision with him. He seems to make them worse. This incident happened a few years ago why is Bart still operating on people? And I noticed he operates in a clinic not a hospital. Is that legal in Belgium?

I really wanted to use 2pass as their prices seem really affordable but I hear noting but horror stories about this guy ðŸ˜­
</p>
<p>
I really hope it sorts out for you, hopefully it&#39;s just still healing ðŸ¤ž

I&#39;m not feeling good about my choice anymore. Something is really off with my eye movement as if I can&#39;t control my eyes like they are loose so I go crosseyed. Then I have this bump that is as hard as rock on my forehead. At first I thought it was swelling but it feels like it is something else. I&#39;m scared. I saw others girls have surgery there and some were mostly very young so I felt reassured but now I&#39;m worried.

In all honesty, this should be blacklisted in the trans community and his license permanently revoked.

Itâ€™s not possible to blacklist anyone as there is no unified trans community.

Well I don&#39;t know if anyone else would know, but my first thought would be to actually call them and ask if this is to be expected.

I posted about a similar problem from the same surgeon a couple weeks ago, though I don&#39;t have any bump.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/gatp0p/my_eyes_dont_focus_quite_as_well_since_i_had_a/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/gatp0p/my_eyes_dont_focus_quite_as_well_since_i_had_a/
</a>
</p>
<p>
Your case sounds more severe than mine, although I am 7 months out compared to 4. I only go cross eyed trying to focus on things that are very close up. I&#39;ve also slowly regained a lot of sensitivity, and it feels more muted than outright numb at this point - like when my foot goes half-asleep, except for my forehead. The main problem for me is just the stiffness of the area and general eyebrow mobility.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bart performs far more aggressive brow lifts than the majority of FFS surgeons - you can see the disparity in results, where the eyebrows on his patients often lie much higher on the face. I personally was fine with that (I&#39;m mixed white and asian, so a higher browline looks appropriate for my eye shape, and I think it looks fine and even more feminine/youthful on people who aren&#39;t anyway) but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it has something to do with these issues, since obviously a more stretched brow is going to have more of an impact on muscles in that part of the face.
</p>
<p>
For what it&#39;s worth, most of his patients I&#39;ve spoke to have said it&#39;s been fine-ish after a year or so, although obviously there are going to be exceptions.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t really explain the &#34;bumpy area&#34;. It could be where he put a screw to hold your brow in place, assuming you had a type 3, although it&#39;s hard for me to say as a random idiot who hasn&#39;t even seen your forehead. I can feel very subtle bumps on the sides of my eyebrows which he told me are the result of that. Most surgeons use a metallic mesh to hold the bone in place, which leaves no bumps but is
<em>
technically
</em>
more invasive, since it covers a much wider area, so it&#39;s uncommon.
</p>
<p>
Whether it&#39;s that or bone paste, you could probably get him to remove it now, or another surgeon if you&#39;d prefer. If it&#39;s harmless and not pronounced, though, it might just be better to get an X-ray and satisfy your curiosity, then learn to live with it if it doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal.
</p>
<p>
My opinion on Dr. Bart overall is that he tends to produce pretty strong results when things go right, but also takes kinda a manufacturing line approach to surgery and does way too many patients per day. So it&#39;s not uncommon for him to accidentally do some low-key weird shit, although for most people it ends up self-resolving and being fine.
