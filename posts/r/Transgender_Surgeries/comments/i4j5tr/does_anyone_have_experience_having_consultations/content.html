Hi, I’m currently underage but am looking to have GRS done sometime in the year after I finish high-school. With long wait times for both consultations and surgeries, I am planning on scheduling a consultation before I am 18, then only having the surgery after I am 18 and insurance will cover it (won’t cover till i turn 18). I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this as a minor, or starting the process as a minor.
</p>

this is exactly what I did! it was super easy, whenever I had my consult for srs it was virtual so I needed to have my mom sign some things and wow surgeons may require a parent to be with you for talking...i’m 18 now and I had srs 5 months ago! couldn’t be happier that I got the ball rolling at 17

depending on where you are my number one piece of advice is look at surgeons that are lesser known!!!

Doing that increases risk.

that’s true. I should’ve mentioned still doing a bunch of research and contacting that surgeon but really no matter where you go it’s a 50/50 chance

There’s a huge difference between the best and worst surgeons, and with an less know surgeon you don’t really know where they fall. Worse, the are usually less known because they don’t have much experience and that’s not good.
