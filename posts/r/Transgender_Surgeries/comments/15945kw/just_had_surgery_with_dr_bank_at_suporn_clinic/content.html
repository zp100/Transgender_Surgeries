How much did you have to pay for the surgery and everything else? And how long do you have to be away from home?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for making this AMA btw!

it was about $26,500 aud for the surgery but not including flight and accomodation.
</p>
<p>
I have to spent a week at the hosptial post-op and then another 3 weeks recovering in a hotel. It is possible to leave a bit earlier but being there for the full 4 weeks is the recommended amount of time by the clinic.

How do you feel? Do you know what depth did Dr Bank manage to give you? Why did you choose Dr. Bank for your srs?

i feel so fine rn ! i am a day out post-surgery going into my second night and only feeling a bit of discomfort. It has been unpleasant being stuck in bed but iâ€™ve mainly been sleeping all day so not too bad. The whole process has been a lot less painful and a lot less difficult then FFS so far. I have been able to sleep with relative ease so that was a relief ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
Dr Bank said he managed 16cm of depth which I am quite happy with. I chose to go with Dr Bank because of all the reviews I heard being super positive. My main priorities were around aesthetics and depth and basically wanting to get as close to a natal vagina as possible which I believe Dr Bank should be able to do. I also had the opportunity to take over for a last minute cancellation so only had to wait a few months. ðŸ’•

Yeah so they use a special non-penile inversion technique only done by the clinic here. Apparently it helps with depth for all types of penises. The website here lists the differences in the technique!

I got super lucky and managed to get in as a last minute cancellation. So I was initially offered a spot for the last half of 2024 however due to a cancellation they managed to squeeze me in to August 2023.

Congratulations on your surgery!
</p>
<p>
If you are up for sharing, I am curious, how many times did you apply to the Suporn lottery before receiving a surgery date. I have tried three times with no luck and am just trying to get an idea of how long it has taken for others. Thanks much.

I am a bit late on this post but wanted to say congratulations! How are you feeling now?
</p>
<p>
If you have time, I have a question about recovery. From what I&#39;ve read some people&#39;s recovery is quite a more difficult than others. I was wondering if you noticed if it was older people who tended to be the ones with more difficulty? I am 47 years old and am trying to get a sense for how much of a factor this may be.
</p>
<p>
Thanks much.
