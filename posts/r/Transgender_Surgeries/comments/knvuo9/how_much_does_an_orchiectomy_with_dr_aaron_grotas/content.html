I had an orchiectomy with him 2 years ago. I went through my insurance and paid about $3k, my in network out of pocket maximum. If I recall correctly, the full bill was for around $10k before insurance.
</p>
<p>
You have to fill out a NY sterilization form when you go for a consultation.
</p>
<p>
The surgery takes 30-40 minutes in total, and as soon as you wake up, they get you out of bed and out the door. If I recall, the actual surgery was not performed by him. I was only informed once I entered the operating room. I think he supervised. I had a midline incision. My scar is invisible now, and my electrologist didn’t even realize it was there for a few hours. I don’t think it will be an issue for my upcoming GCS. Overall it was an easy surgery. I took 2 weeks off, but could have gone back to work in less than 1.

No more than your out of pocket maximum. Dr. Grotas’ office should be able to apply for prior authorization if given notes from your doctor and phych.
