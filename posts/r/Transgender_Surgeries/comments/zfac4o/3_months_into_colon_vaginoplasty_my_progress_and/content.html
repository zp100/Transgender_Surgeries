When does the bleeding actually stop?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
For me any remaining blood i had cleared fully at around 3 weeks if i remember correctly , im 9 months post op but i went to Dr. Theerapong and i also remained on my estrogen injections during surgery and healing which was a major factor in my healing journey. I healed way faster than the girls who had surgery around the same time as me and stopped taking hormones.
</p>
<blockquote>

<li>
When the colon starts pushing the dilstor out. Should I listen to it and take it out and out it back in? Or should I just keep it in despite the pushing?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
I noticed that too but the peristaltic movents are not enough that i have to take the dilator fully out i keep my hand over the dilator end applying light pressure so it doesn&#39;t come out and if it starts moving it would be about an inch or two out and then it goes back in after since i have my hand on the end of dilator applying light pressure. It definitely got better though at first it was harder so i would take into account that you are still early and healing.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
What are your experiences with granulation tissue or bleeding?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
i got no granulation tissue , bleeding stopped early for me. If you have granulation tissue maybe find a doctor who is experienced with that so they can treat it with silver nitrate im not aware if it goes away on its own eventually since i never had it.
</p>

Why does it take longer to dilate some days than others? I think your pelvic floor muscles might be the issue since you are saying that you need a few minutes to put the dilator in , even early in recovery it took me a few seconds to insert the dilator in. Do you fully relax your muscles down there ? I know a natural reaction when insering something in there is to tense up which makes it harder and uncomfortable to insert something.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;ve been thinking about taking ibuprofen before dilating to reduce swelling as I dilate. Would this work?
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Im thinking no there shouldnt be much swelling inside most of the swelling its externally unless you have granulation tissue inside the canal which makes dilation slow and uncomfortable.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
I cannot have a full dilation without having to stop halfway because of having to go pee!
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Have you tried urinating before a dilation session ? I find it helps sometimes i noticed that too , the reason is because our vaginas are between the rectum and the bladder just right under your bladder you have your g spot (aka prostate) when that receives stimulation it can trigger the sensation that you need to pee. I found that happening early in recovery , now that sensation is only apparent when i stimulate my g spot in a sexual manner but the sensation is not just feeling like i need to pee is mixed with pleasure too is very hard to explain but it feels really good.
