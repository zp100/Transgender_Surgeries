Does anyone know if McGinn is good at FFS? I canâ€™t find any pictures of her FFS work online.

She will likely defer you to facial team or someone like that. My friend went to her for an FFS consult and that&#39;s what she recommended. I also asked her about a rhinoplasty and she basically told me that her specialty is GCS and BA. I had GCS with her and the results are amazing but I appreciate her honesty in deferring me elsewhere for facial work if she feels like someone else could do a better job

Damn, the more I read about her the more I like her. Passing up personal gain for the well-being of patients.

Literally the worst thing I&#39;ve heard about her is she doesn&#39;t sugar-coat anything, which is a + to me.

Wow thatâ€™s really admirable of her. I guess Iâ€™ll just get GCS and BA from her when the time comes.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Hi!
</p>
<p>
Recovery was much easier than I anticipated. Just do everything they tell you to do and you should be fine
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reputation, location (only 160 miles from home) and the fact that she is trans herself
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do you recommend Dr. McGinn?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes very much if you can afford her because she does not take insurance.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
8/10. I am probably going to go for a labiaplasty. And I am probably just being picky but my labia could be &#34;puffier&#34; if that makes sense?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
10/10
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How is your vaginal depth?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Excellent. A bit over 6 inches. That all depends on &#34;donor&#34; material though - which is more about scrotal skin that penile length it seems. Its been like 17 months or so now and typing this reply - it&#39;s easy to forget what parts became what parts at this point.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How was the stay in New Hope?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I stayed at the Gaia Guest House B&amp;B which offers excellent discounts to McGinn patients. She is the owner. The room I stayed in was fantastic - so was the staff (just the caretaker and one other gentleman). They are lovely. Very peaceful and quiet.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How was Dr. McGinn aftercare?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also top notch. They answer any and all questions and are very available via phone or email for times when you can&#39;t be there in person. This is all they do and they are very comfortable to talk to.
</p>
<p>
Thanks and good luck with your surgery! If you have any other questions please feel free! ðŸ¦‹

It&#39;s the hippocratic oath - thou shall do no harm. Unlike some FFS surgeons who will push for procedures you don&#39;t need just to get more money out of you or performing surgeries outside his title and training regardless if you end up disfigured or dead.

Doesn&#39;t she offer free FFS for veterans though? How does that work if she doesn&#39;t ever do it?
