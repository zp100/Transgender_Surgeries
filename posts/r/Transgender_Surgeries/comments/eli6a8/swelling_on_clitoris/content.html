Post OP girls, how long did it take for your clitoris to unswell? I am just curious if my clitoris is just too big or if there still is a chance it is somewhat swollen at the 6 months mark. I don&#39;t like how it looks much right now. To be fair I don&#39;t like a lot of things about my results, but that is beside the point :P

It was several months before I looked down one day and realized the swelling in that area had finally gone down. It&#39;s not so much the clitoris that swells as it is the entire area under and around it. Keep in mind that&#39;s basically the same area your prior equipment was located, and that&#39;s where some of the most complex and detailed reconstructive work is done during surgery.
</p>
<p>
People will say this over and over, but it&#39;s true: 6 months is still too early to know what your final results will look like. I&#39;m 9 months post-op and there have been changes in the past 3 months. It takes a good year before everything has settled into place and all of the residual swelling is finally gone -- this is why most surgeons don&#39;t even start considering aesthetic revisions until 9-12 months after surgery.

Your post does give me some hope. Thanks, Chinchilla!
</p>
<p>
You know, you are absolutely right. I think my clitoris is too big BUT I can feel that there is some swelling under it as well, and I wonder if that is what is making my labia look more &#34;spread&#34; than they should based on many results I saw from the same surgeon who did my surgery. It is like there is a mass beneath the clitoris, but since this anatomy is new to me I didn&#39;t know if that was expected to be there (although it feels slightly sore so I had a feeling it wasn&#39;t natural).
</p>
<p>
One day I was touching my clitoral area and wondering how Chett and his team managed to construct the clitoris so well (despite being big IMO but that might be temporary) with my old equipment. It is such an interesting surgery.

I discussed this a little bit with my surgeon at an early post-op checkup. There are two things that you&#39;re noticing right now, and swelling around the clitoral area is likely what&#39;s making it look more prominent.
</p>
<p>
But I think you should also understand that it&#39;s common for GRS surgeons to make our clitorises a
<em>
little
</em>
larger than the cis average for a very good reason: nerves. Penises don&#39;t have quite the density of nerve endings that natal clitorises do, so making our clitorises smaller would result in less sensation. Surgeons have to maintain a balance of creating a clitoris that still retains good sensation. There&#39;s a little bit of a compromise that has to occur, but once all of the surrounding swelling is gone, it shouldn&#39;t be terribly noticeable.

I can accept having it a little larger than the usual, after all, even some cis girls have larger than the usual clitoris. However, it does look a little too prominent, yes, like there is something pushing the clitoris up, it is even making the labia look slightly irregular.

Cis girl here. I saw your mention of how you don’t like how your new vagina looks. I flipped down to your one month post pic and girl- that’s a vagina. Get out there and look at more vaginas! There are seriously so many shapes and sizes and flaps- it’s crazy,
</p>
<p>
Best of luck on the swelling.

hi, cis friend.
</p>
<p>
the funny thing is that it looked more like a proper vulva back then despite the swelling! after most of the swelling disappeared, it turns out there is a space between the two labia that I have never seen in other vulvas, and I am not talking about those we see in pornography (there is a cool site with lots of pictures of vulva and stuff)
</p>
<p>
to be fair, I didn&#39;t expect to have a gorgeous vagina but I kinda hoped it would be &#34;passable&#34; enough, you know? especially since I am lesbian and I am pretty sure any girl will know something is off about my equipment.
</p>
<p>
thank you, though &lt;3

It took around 4 weeks for me before all clitoral swelling had subsided but my SRS surgery only took 90 minutes because I had vaginoplasty without vaginal cavity.
