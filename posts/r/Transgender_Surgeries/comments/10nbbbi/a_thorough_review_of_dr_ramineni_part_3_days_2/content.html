This little series of mine is going to be highlighting my experiences choosing Dr. Ramineni as my surgeon. My goal is to provide as much info as possible so that people can make an informed decision towards whether they would or wouldn&#39;t want him to be their surgeon. Especially since he does roughly 135 vaginoplasties a year, but not many people highlight their journeys from going with him. This part will be focusing on my big day of rest right after surgery, then my eventful day of getting my dressing and epidural removed, and meeting with a physical therapist to start walking.

</p>
<p>
The day after surgery was all about rest I had originally woken up around 6am for vitals and more pain meds. Then I slept until my nurses shifts changed over to the day crew (they were all again super sweet and focused on my health).
</p>
<p>
I met with Dr. Ramineni around 9am as he was doing his rounds checking in on all his patients. Again he gushed at how easy my anatomy was to work with and how he was able to get amazing depth because of it. Then he explained the game plan for the next few days before asking if I had any questions. Which I did and he helped explain some specific questions towards my dressing that I had. Then he gleefully walked out of the room and I left another convo with him feeling heard and reassured.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the day was all pain management. I generally would go to sleep from pain meds after pain ramped up anywhere between 3-7/10 then wake up to it slowly creeping back up and repeating the pain meds sleep cycle.
</p>
<p>
My epidural site started to hurt a good bit as I was having a convo with my mom and BFF. The nurses checked everything and there was no issues. I just was having too much pressure being applied directly too it so they immediately grabbed me a lower back pillow and one for my head/shoulders too. I kept getting super sweaty day/night because the thermostat was having trouble actually lowering the temp. So I was going through ice packs and ice water like nobody&#39;s business! That was pretty much my main issue throughout the day. Just moderate pain that they did a good job bringing down, but sweating like crazy! ðŸ˜‚
</p>
<p>
Day 3&#39;s goals were to have my dressing, epidural removed, then I needed to be evaluated by a physical therapist.
</p>
<p>
A strange thing happened at 5am I started feeling my pussy muscles starting to move a little. Then they learned how to clench. Something that caused consistent flare ups of pain throughout the day. I would be napping for a while then an intense moment in a dream would make my pussy clench on my packing and then I would wake up from the jolt of pain.
</p>
<p>
Dressing removal gave me first glimpse of my gal and I&#39;m in love already from the top down angle even tho she&#39;s def got some swollen bits too her. Talked shop with Katie and she explained the next few days gameplan and what to expect when I get home Friday night. She also reassured me that my muscles were just waking back up and that I wasn&#39;t going to dmg my gal or my canal with the sporadic clenches. She explained how much the packing was stitched in there and how I was perfectly fine. She just said to focus on breathing in those moments and to prioritize pain meds when I wanted to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Then I had my epidural removed which was super easy and way less pulling on skin from adhesive than when the dressing got removed so it was honestly easy af. But this also caused more feeling to come back downstairs meaning my lovely lil clenches hurt a lil more throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
Then I just had to meet with the PT. He explained everything in a really calm and clear way. He wasn&#39;t expecting me to jump over the moon. We just worked from sitting at the edge of the bed, to standing with a walker, then scooting around with the walker, and finally taking a little walk down the hall with no walker. He then had me sit in a chair for a little under an hour (this was personally the worst and I stopped after like 20min). After which I got some more pain meds and napped until lunch/when my mom and BFF arrived back at the hospital! The rest of the day/night was focused on pain management and taking little strolls when I had the energy and when my pain was manageable!
</p>
<p>
That day was really the turning point when it came to pain. Before then the epidural was a blessing, but after it&#39;s removal I really needed to bounce between my pain med rotations all night to sleep. Tbf tho I&#39;m also a giant princess when it comes to pain so some stronger willed people will probably be pretty unfazed by everything. Being able to see my gal was sooooo wonderful. I still hadn&#39;t gotten a clear look at her yet. But she was all mine even tho my labia we&#39;re def starting to get more swollen now that the dressing no longer was compressing everything!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be stopping here for the night but next post will be all about my discharge day. Which was pretty eventful! I got many more glimpses of my pussy and had to work around a lot more pain as I got driven home! I can&#39;t wait to continue with this series and I hope all of you wonderful people have a great day/night! ðŸ’–ðŸ’—ðŸ’•ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ

Congrats on your surgery! I hope your recovery goes well!
</p>
<p>
Can I ask did you have the epidural after waking up from surgery to treat pain? Or if not, why did you need an epidural? My bottom surgery they just did under general anesthesia.

I had both the epidural and general anesthesia for my surgery! They kept the epidural in for 3 days in, including the day of surgery. I&#39;m a lil princess towards pain so it definitely came in handy! ðŸ¤£

I&#39;m surprised, I&#39;ve never heard of an epidural for bottom surgery!

The hospital my surgeon uses def had a vibe of mitigating as much pain as possible. Every single nurse really was focus on mitigating my pain throughout my stay!
