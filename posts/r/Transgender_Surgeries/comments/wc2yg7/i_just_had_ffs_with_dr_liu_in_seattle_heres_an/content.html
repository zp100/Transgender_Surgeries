<strong>
TLDR:
</strong>
Had FFS with Dr. Liu yesterday. Procedures were brow lift with incision behind hairline, Type 3 Frontal Setback, orbital contouring, full jaw and chin contouring, pericraneum graft behind upper lip, trach shave. Currently fresh in recovery, but feeling optimistic after a rough first day :)

Hi! I never thought I&#39;d make a Reddit account, much less post something, but I have gained so much from those who&#39;ve shared their experiences, and I want to return the favor. Trans people helping trans people is how we&#39;ve survived and how we&#39;ll keep surviving. Hopefully this is helpful to at least one person. I am a pretty anxious person and like to plan out every step, and I&#39;ve never had any surgery before, nor have I gone under general anesthesia (had my wisdom teeth out with a local) so I think the most intimidating thing about this process is how many unknowns there seem to be and how many steps there are to the process. My goal here is to be detailed for anyone else in the same boat! Thanks for reading :) P.S I&#39;m writing this on mobile in bed so please forgive any formatting errors.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Some quick facts about me: American living in Seattle, 27yo, HRT since August 15, 2020. No other surgeries (though I&#39;ve been in line for zero-depth with Dr. Dy for a while now). Living with my partner who is my primary support and a total angel. Work full-time as a construction project manager for a small private company. Took three weeks off from work for recovery (Dr. Liu recommended 2). I have Kaiser of Washington through my work (Silver PPO to be precise).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<h1>
GETTING THE BALL ROLLING:
</h1>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t sure at the start of transition whether I wanted FFS, but by Nov/Dec of 2021 I decided to at least consult (classic euphoria to dysphoria pipeline). I reached out to my gender health case manager at Kaiser, and she gave me the list of in-network surgeons (Dr. Nuara at Virginia Mason in Seattle, Dr. Liu at the Polyclinic in Seattle, and Dr. Meltzer at the Meltzer Clinic somewhere in Arizona), essentially Kaiser&#39;s preferred and for-sure covered surgeons.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I liked what I saw from Dr. Liu and to a certain extent from Dr. Nuara, while Dr. Meltzer I read some stories on this sub and didn&#39;t think he would be a good fit for me. So I reached out to the first two! Dr. Liu&#39;s office got back to me what felt like instantly, and I scheduled a consult for March 29th. Dr. Nuara is apparently way busier since their first opening for me for a consult was August 2022. Not that speed is the end-all-be-all but I would still be waiting to consult if I had gone with Nuara lol. Anyways so the availability felt like a clincher for Dr. Liu since I already knew I liked his work. In case you don&#39;t know he is relatively new to Seattle but is pretty active on insta and has posted lots of photos of his results.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I did need one letter from my therapist to get the referral from Kaiser (I wanted to start everything with them first, as that seemed the safest way to make sure any procedure I&#39;m getting into is covered). However Dr. Liu&#39;s office also required a letter to get the surgery scheduled (not the consult, just the surgery), so that helped me get scheduled directly during my consult. Highly recommend.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<h1>
CONSULTATION and CT SCAN:
</h1>
<p>
Fast forward to March 29th, day of my consult. This is a big paragraph, bear with me!! I met Dr. Liu at the Polyclinic in Seattle, and he started off by asking me some general things about my transition, and then he wanted to know specifically what I wanted out of FFS... essentially what my dysphoria was pointing me towards. I mentioned my brow, jaw, chin, and trachea, which he agreed with. He does really incredible rhino work but I&#39;m fairly happy with my nose and I shared that with him, and he was totally accepting of that. His opinion was that a lip lift was unnecessary, and he said my hairline was within cis range so he would be making the incision behind it, hidden in my hair, and then he made one recommendation: a pericraneum graft behind my upper lip to give it a bit more volume, which I loved. I think this is a bit of a signature thing for him, although I could be wrong. His evaluation of my brow was that I would likely need a Type 3 frontal setback, which would require him to operate on me at one of the larger local hospitals (Swedish), however there was a slim chance I was a Type 1, which would allow him to perform my procedure on his home turf at the Polyclinic. He took some nice before photos, told me to get a CT scan for him to review, and sent me to his scheduler. I wasn&#39;t sure before, but I walked away from the consult having decided that this was the right path
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
His scheduler said if I was a Type 1, I could theoretically be getting surgery in May, and that Type 3 would mean more like July (Dr. Liu only performs surgeries at Swedish on Fridays, hence the reduced availability). Since Dr. Liu said Type 3 was extremely likely, she put me down for July 29th depending on the results from my CT scan. Kaiser is super particular about coverage for things like CT scans since they have their own facilities and don&#39;t like paying for you to go to an unaffiliated clinic, so I reached out to my case manager and she got me a referral for a Kaiser clinic three weeks out.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to April, CT scan went fine, it was only about 10 minutes and nowhere near as scary as I had expected... I feel like tv shows and movies make them seem way more intense than they are, or maybe I&#39;m thinking of MRIs?? Who knows. But they sent that straight over to Dr. Liu&#39;s office, and although I didn&#39;t receive a 3D scan I did get to check my chart and read the narrative description of my skull... lots of googling of medical jargon later, I knew I had a lot of work to do on my chin (exected that) and that my brow was a Type 3, so the July date would hold. All I had to do was wait... easy right? lmao
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<h1>
PRE-OP APPT:
</h1>
<p>
About a month and a half before my scheduled surgery date, I got an email from Dr. Liu&#39;s scheduler with the official surgery date/time info, as well as my pre- and post-op appointment times. I had been sent into a tailspin about two weeks earlier regarding a big delay in bottom-surgery scheduling, so having FFS locked in was super comforting.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The pre-op appointment was on July 25th, so basically right on the eve of surgery. I met with a nurse first, who gave me a packet of info from the Polyclinic about recovery info, as well as a big boilerplate pre-surgery packet from Swedish Hospital where it would be taking place. We discussed the medications I would be taking after surgery, and also she let me know that I would not have to pause my HRT. From what I&#39;ve read, this varies a ton from surgeon to surgeon, but Dr. Liu is definitely on the more cutting edge side of things and his opinion is that the Estrogen we have available now does not pose much of a blood clot risk to justify halting it.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Then Dr. Liu came in and I finally got to see the 3D scan of my skull. Ahhhhh. He uses the scans to create 3D-printed guides for the cuts he makes on the brow and chin, and also outlines all the spots where he&#39;ll be removing material. I just about started crying seeing all the changes that would happen, it felt so surreal. He discussed with me the approach he would be taking, and also got my opinion about how aggressive to be with regards to my mandible/jaw (answer: very aggressive please lol). He is generally conservative, but he was open to my opinion and thought it was a good approach. Final verdict on procedures:
</p>
<p>
-Type 3 Frontal Setback
</p>
<p>
-Orbital contouring
</p>
<p>
-Brow lift (achieved with the incision behind my hairline)
</p>
<p>
-Full jaw and chin contouring
</p>
<p>
-Pericraneum (skin from my incision behind the hairline) graft to upper lip
</p>
<p>
-Tracheal shave
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I shared with him that I was extremely nervous and he did his best to encourage me, and off I went to melt into a puddle of anxiety until Friday!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<h1>
SURGERY:
</h1>
<p>
Per my packet from the hospital, I needed to cease all food and non-clear liquids 8 hours before, and all liquids period 2 hours before. I also needed to take two cleansing showers, one the night before and one the night of, with a special anti-septic soap. Being a consumate worrier, I was convinced I would mess this up and die of sepsis on the operating table, but it was not to be! They ended up having me wipe down in pre-op anyway so go figure.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I got next to no sleep the night before, which was totally expected. Check in time was 6:00am, for an 8:00am surgery. Check in was a breeze, but I had to stew in my anxiety for about an hour before they brought me back to pre-op. I brought nothing with me to pre-op except the clothes I was wearing - they had me fill out a card with my partner&#39;s number so they could call her when I was ready. She was allowed to come with which was a huge comfort. They had me scrub down again, change into scrubs, and answer all those questions about medical history (get ready to answer those about a million times...). Then Dr. Liu came by and was such a calming presence. He made some marks about where the incision would be for my trach shave, and we confirmed the procedures one last time.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Next was the anesthesiologist, who went over what he&#39;d be doing, and got me set up for an IV. I very nearly passed out when he put it in, probably a mixture of anxiety and low blood sugar, but they reclined me and I just rode it out. I shared with him that I have a family history of extreme nausea after general anesthesia and he said he&#39;d add some drugs and a patch to help with that.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
My nurse came by and had me pee one more time, I said goodbye to my girlfriend, and they wheeled me into the operating room on a wheelchair. I remember they were playing Norah Jones (love you baby!! my one and only) and that I laid down and the nurse chatted with me about Seattle neighborhoods for about 30 seconds and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t even remember like a countdown or anything. Just instantly waking up in the recovery area. They gave me some apple juice and had me dress, and then they wheeled me out to the pickup area where my partner was waiting. The whole process from start of surgery to getting in the car to leave was ~6.5 hours.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<h1>
RECOVERY:
</h1>
<p>
Leaving the hospital I felt pretty much okay, just groggy and swollen. They sent me home with some syringes (i guess to help me eat? since i&#39;m restricted to soft food), some polysporin (i guess for wound care? although I have mupirocin prescribed by Dr. Liu), and the 3D prints of my skull and the guides that Dr. Liu used to cut it (!!!!!). Once we got home I got straight into bed and I&#39;ve basically been here ever since lol. I am now a bedperson, like the grandparents in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. My plan is to start frequent short walks probably today though, to stay active and help prevent clots.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Bandage-wise I am currently trussed up like turkey; it&#39;s a wrap around my head and also under my chin, cradling my jaw and forehead. Same as most folks post photos of on this sub. It restricts my mouth pretty effectively, such that even small spoons have trouble getting in there. I also got an ice-pack sling that goes under my chin which I&#39;ve been using constantly to help with pain and the swelling, which is rampant. I am not including photos because I currently resemble a Troll (literally a Troll Doll, I have thick curly hair and a lil squirt of it escaped the bandage so it looks like the top of a carrot). The bandage is set to come off tomorrow afternoon, 48 hours post-surgery, but I&#39;ll keep using the sling throughout my time off (3 weeks) to help with swelling. I can shower once the bandage is off, which is exciting but also nerve-wracking considering i have sutures from one ear to the other. Since I didn&#39;t have any nose work done, my only external incisions are on the top of my head and in the line of my chin. The jaw and chin work and lip graft were all done from inside my mouth. Bottom line: all my sutures will be dissolving on their own.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Medication-wise, it&#39;s all pretty overwhelming. I have meds for anti-nausea, mouth wash, antibiotics, constipation, pain (oxycodone as well as tylenol, and aspirin starting tomorrow), wound care for when the bandage comes off, and of course my normal HRT regime. I&#39;ve been trying to keep everything straight with notes about timing and what to take when, and my girlfriend has been so helpful, but I still feel like i&#39;m missing something lol. My goal is to be off the narcotics tomorrow, switching to just ice, tylenol, aspirin and &#34;good clean livin&#34;. That will eliminate the need for the stool softener as well, since it&#39;s the narcotics that back most people up.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Yesterday was pretty brutal once the medications from surgery wore off. Nausea hit me very hard about 4 hours after surgery, and i ended up throwing up my first dose of narcotics, antibiotics, and anti-nausea (lol). The rest of the evening was a lot of pain, nausea, and hunger since I couldn&#39;t eat anything. I finally managed to keep some tomato soup down around 9:30pm, and Dr. Liu called me up to check on me and answered my questions (Ex: &#34;I threw up on my sutures, am I going to get infected and die&#34;).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Once I got some food in me, I took all relevant medications (antibiotics since i finally could eat, oxy, tylenol, stool softener, progesterone, mouth wash, sublingual estradiol) and &#34;went to bed&#34; around 11ish. I&#39;m sleeping on a mound of pillows to keep me elevated, which has taken some getting used to but is good for swelling and keeping my airways clear. I woke up about every hour and a half, and would take that chance to switch out my ice, drink some water, and re-up pain meds if it was the appropriate time. Then I woke up this morning well before my partner and took the chance to write this out in my notes app lol because I haven&#39;t been able to turn my brain off since like 5:00am.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<h1>
LOOKING AHEAD:
</h1>
<p>
I have a post-op appoinment next week with Dr. Liu where he would remove sutures, if I had any, and check in on my progress. In the meantime, it&#39;s &#34;good clean living&#34; as I said above.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Billing-wise, my Kaiser plan has a 30% coinsurance for this procedure, so I&#39;m planning on deductible+30% of total procedure up to my out of pocket maximum, which is currently ~$6,000. Still a chunk of change that I&#39;ve had to save for, but much more manageable than if it was all out of pocket.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m honestly still in shock that this happened, it all feels a bit like a dream (although with more vomit than I would prefer). That evil little dysphoria devil is there in the back of my head, saying things like &#34;what if it doesn&#39;t turn out well, what if it&#39;s still the same, I&#39;ll bet you still look like a man&#34; but I&#39;m doing my best to quash that. I am happy and proud of myself for following this process through and advocating for myself. I am also so so grateful and I wish these procedures were widely available and financially accessible to all. Not that everyone needs FFS, but everyone should have the option and the means to get it if they want it. Okay, that&#39;s it! If you managed to read this far, thanks for your patience! Hopefully this was helpful in some way. I&#39;m happy to answer any and all questions :)

I had ffs with Dr. Liu in Dec and March and I am so so happy with my results. I&#39;ve connected with a few other patients and they look amazing. He is so talented and great bedside manner. You&#39;ll start to be less swollen sooner than you think. Congrats so happy for you!

Good to hear and glad you’re doing well. Now that insurance covers these procedures more, I’ve been trying to get a consult with him because, as I’ve gotten a little bit older, I’m seeing some facial features that didn’t show up so much when I was younger but I find I’m not happy with now. Any sort of insurance coverage was just a pipe dream when I first had some facial work back in the early 2000s. Super glad you were able to make this happen for yourself and it sounds like you’re in good hands. Happy healing and keep us posted!  One more thing: how was the tracheal shave done? Right above it, or under the chin, or what? Thanks!

thank you! it&#39;s such a wonder that insurance is shifting towards providing coverage for these procedures, I know Washington mandates it now and it&#39;s a financial lifesaver. I hope you have good luck getting a consult with him! He just oozes competence, I felt comfortable right away. To answer your question, I don&#39;t know exactly where the incision for my trach is as it&#39;s still under bandages, but when we discussed it in Pre-Op he made some marks and said he was tucking it up under the chin so as to be mostly out of sight. I can update this when the bandages come off tomorrow :)

Yay!! Super happy for you! I just had FFS with Nuara on July 6th, so I’m almost a month out from healing! Definitely relate to not being able to believe that it is real! It’s great that you were able to post about another Seattle surgeon, I’m thinking of posting my experience as well, but am just apprehensive about posting any photos of my face on the internet. I am so thankful that I healed very fast, still have residual swelling in my nose from the septorhinoplasty though.

nice!! yeah there&#39;s some good surgeons up here, not many people talk about them that I&#39;ve seen. I would love to hear about your experience with Nuara should you decide to share it, but I totally know what you mean with showing your face on the internet. more power to the people who do, but I definitely get nervous about it so that&#39;s why I stuck with a text post. congrats on your speedy recovery!

Thank you!! For sure, for sure! I think I would potentially be more open to sharing a before and after over private message at least. But I’m definitely going to try and get started on making a post of my own on here as well, detailing the experience :)

What A trooper for writing this so soon. And a terrific recount it is. Wishing you all the best for recovery. You sound as thorough and analytical as me, which is a blessing and curse for me. 😂 I’m wanting some jaw work too and my main worries really extend to mental nerve damage. Would be interesting to read your take on this?
</p>
<p>
Take care of yourself.

I&#39;m not sure what you mean by mental nerve damage, are you distinguishing that from &#34;normal&#34; nerve damage, ie loss of sensation? I haven&#39;t been able to notice anything on that front with regards to my jaw, but I will try to update this as I proceed through recovery

Sorry for the light thread necromancy, but I am researching surgeons in Seattle and I was wondering: what&#39;s Dr. Liu&#39;s first name?  There are so many Dr. Lius in Seattle!

Pericranium graft to upper lip?
</p>
<p>
How does this work? Did he explain the procedure? Do they take the subQ fat of your scalp or something? Like, what about the scalp hair follicles?

yes his explanation was that they took a piece of the subcutaneous fat from the incision at my scalp and they inserted it behind my upper lip. I have three incisions on my upper lip on the inside of my mouth where he opened up the space for it and then sutured it closed. essentially home-made filler. no mention of hair follicles! I should have asked, this is a good question for my follow up appointment

Thanks :) I wanna ask my surgeon about this too cuz it sounds awesome and maybe they can do it for me since it sounds really easy to do in the middle of my main procedures!

Very late but thank you for posting this! I reread it a lot as I was pursuing ffs with Dr. Liu and it went pretty much exactly as you described it. Having this as a guide was very comforting!

Not sure if you’re pretty active on here or not but I’m in a very similar situation and also have Kaiser and the same out of pocket max. As far as paying, is that an amount that needs to be paid before the surgery can take place or is it what your insurance will bill you after the fact?
</p>
<p>
Thank you!
