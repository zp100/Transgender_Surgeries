hey! some info that i would have liked to hear beforehand that i figure i should share:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
i am canadian. the surgery was by Dr. Kenan Celtik with Crane in San Francisco, USA. OHIP (ontario health insurance) covered my surgery 100%, including the hospital stay, except for travel and airBNB.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
i started blockers at age 10, so the surgeon was worried i wouldn&#39;t have enough skin material and skin grafts were possibly needed, but they didn&#39;t end up needing any! somehow Dr Celtik worked his magic and i got a great exterior with a LOT of depth inside. No idea how he did such a good job
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
recovery has been awesome and i am super mobile already, i can walk vast distances and am able to navigate the house easily already
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
dialating is easy peasy :) no need to worry!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dr Celtik and everyone at the Crane Center have been super lovely and sweet and excellent. Celtik himself seems so happy and proud of his work every time i&#39;ve been in for a post-op visit which is super relieving. He is honestly a really great guy
</p>

Looking very good for 10 days post op!  Congrats!!  If you don&#39;t mind me asking what method did he use?  Yes, not having enough material is one of my concerns as well and from Ontario as well.  Do you know if Crane offers sigmoid colon vaginoplasty?  Can I ask how much material  you had to start with at the time of the operation?  Did they end up doing an grafts?  Again, looking great!  Congratulations and lots of hugs on your recovery! xoxo  Almost forgot.  How long was your wait time?  Thanks!

i had robotic assisted peritoneal flap vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
i have no idea if they offer that or not, sorry :(
</p>
<p>
i dont know exactly how much i had beforehand, as i literally never looked. but from what i remember as a child, something like 1.5-3 inches?? they did not end up doing any grafts.
</p>
<p>
as soon as i got approved by OHIP, Crane asked when i could have surgery. i said May was the earliest i was available, so it happened May 9th. It was about a 6 month wait, but that&#39;s because i couldnt do it earlier lol!!
</p>
<p>
hope this helps!!

That’s AMAZING.  I her wait times of like a year or more here from girls in the states. I even scheduled an orchy because it was going to be a two year wait time before getting in to see Min Jun when he was still with them. Coming up on my surgery date soon for my orchy and still haven’t gotten my appointment for gcs, but will also need/want the robotic assisted peritoneal flap procedure.  I think the sigmoid/colon surgery is a thing of the past? It really isn’t the preferred way to do things anymore. Far too invasive, unnecessarily so, lots of risks of fistulas developing, then the documented problems later on.
</p>
<p>
Anyway yogurt girl is really lovely. Congratulations on such a great result!

Contrary to what some believe sigmoid colon vaginoplasty is not a thing of the past.  PPT also has its&#39; drawbacks.  One of the issues with PPT is that prolapse is more likely than with sigmoid colon.  If you have prolapse one of the best ways to repair this condition is with sigmoid colon.  Sigmoid colon also affords better lubrication and can facilitate depth only restricted by the cavity of the body.  It is quite possible to have a vaginal canal of 9&#34; if one wished.  With Sigmoid colon it leaves the surgeon with more options to form all of the external genitalia.  If you are short, have a high circumcision or small scrotum Sigmoid colon provides for a better general outcome aesthetically.  However, all of this depends on the surgeon.  Hope this helps with your understanding regarding Sigmoid colon being a thing of the past.  Hugs. xo

You really are sold n it. And after seeing patient after patient with recto-vaginal fistulas and reading the actual studies, I’m really convinced if it isn’t a thing if the past it needs to be, and no, a vaginal canal of 9 inches isn’t possible except in some anime fantasy. The depth of the vagina is limited by the length of the opening measured to the pubic bone. Which, despite pornographic fantasies averages 4-6 inches at a max. Also suggesting you can have whatever length suggests you don’t understand that to do sigmoid they remove part of your colon, which you actually need for proper digestion etc. If you’ve never spent time with anyone with an colonostomy, I suggest you do so before championing the technique. You might find it enlightening. (I have, and was the in home care giver for an ostomy patient for ten years.)  Next, PPT uses a small portion of the peritoneum, which serves very little other function than cushioning internal surfaces. It is self-lubricating but less so and some research suggests more as needed than in sigmoid which also has a long track record of bacterial vaginosis due to it constantly lubricating, it never stops. That’s also what leads to the odor issue so many note. And for patients with minimal external genitalia, it’s the exact reason robotic assisted (which means minimally invasive and shorter recovery times, unlike sigmoid surgeries, is the preferred choice today.  Have a great day.

Thanks for your detailed response.  You speak as if you are a doctor.  Are you a doctor?  If so what is your specialty?  I&#39;m always interested in good constructive discussion regarding gender affirming options.  Before I provide my response please kindly answer my questions and I&#39;ll be glad to engage further on this topic.  Please provide references to the studies that you reference.  Always helpful to have.  Thanks.

First, I’m sorry if my response sounded unkind. It wasn’t meant to. I’m home sick today so my exhaustion might be showing. No I’m not a doctor. I was an EMT, ER tech, and OR tech at various times. As I said I was an in home caregiver trained medically, but I’m also not a nurse.
</p>
<p>
At least one study I can share can be found here:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://research.vumc.nl/ws/files/698809/complete%20dissertation.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://research.vumc.nl/ws/files/698809/complete%20dissertation.pdf
</a>
</p>
<p>
The significant part is chapter nine point out that most notably the patients exhibited various signs and symptoms consistent with diversion colitis. It’s interesting that the patients were screened ahead of time and none had histories of gastroenteritis, colorectal cancer, or other complications. You can read the pertinent data, but many exhibited diversion colonitis (most commonly seen in post-operative patients that had received an illeostomy or colonostomy).  It was also noted there was reduced vascularization of the examined areas (basically a reduction in the amount vascular tissue surrounding and nourishing the neovaginal canal).  And it’s saying we see these same sorts of infections and inflammations in patients who had their excretory stream diverted through an ostomy.  What’s good is that for studies dealing with transgender patients 48 is a decent sample size. And this came out of one clinic so sample data is biased toward any practices in clinic that may have contributed. Would love to do. Meta case study examining results across multiple clinics and locales to better verify the replicability of the data set.
</p>
<p>
Now our discussion was in comparison to PPT, and of course as a newer procedure we don’t have the same level of data to compare with. Hopefully in the next few years we can get that data.  There are multiple factors in what makes a rewarding experience for Trwnsgender patients and just because the neovulva is say aesthetically pleasing isn’t necessarily going to be the best choice if there are other factors like contant yeast infections, bacterial infections, or UTIs and Trans patients deserve to have that data to make informed choices.
</p>
<p>
And now I’m drinking my orange juice and heading back to bed!

I apologize for the late reply as I&#39;ve been out of town.   I had to post this in two parts due to its&#39; length.
</p>
<p>
I could not agree with you more that trans women and men both deserve to have all options presented and available to them in their quest to realize their true selves.
</p>
<p>
The paper you referenced is presented as a thesis and is not a research paper.  Important distinction in that a ‘theses’ is not pier reviewed which is the standard for publications to be considered as medically significant.  Hence, in professional terms boils down to his ‘opinion’ based on his research.
</p>
<p>
Example of his opinion not based on fact but observation:
</p>
<p>
‘Multiple surgical approaches exist, but there is an elevated chance of complications
</p>
<p>
compared to primary vaginoplasty. Especially rectal perforations up to 20% are being mentioned by colleagues’.  How do these mentions translate to ‘medically accepted practice’?
</p>
<p>
In his ‘thesis’ he recognizes the importance of other techniques for those that do not have enough material for an aesthetically pleasing neovagina.
</p>
<p>
Here is a link explaining alternative forms of vaginoplasty explaining the +’s and –‘s of each.

As it has been referenced in recent literature was originally coined as the ‘Davydov Procedure’ and performed initially and exclusively on natal women suffering from collapse/prolapse of the vaginal canal.  This has now been adapted to vaginoplasty for trans women. The origins of this technique date back to 1974.

Part 2.  I could go on at nauseum presenting references and options for trans women as more of my focus of my research has been trans women.
</p>
<p>
Not to argue but to educate and inform accurately, I know of 4 trans girls presently with a 9” vaginal canal as a results of sigmoid colon vaginoplasty.  This is not a thing of Anime or any other pornographic presentation.  These are real living breathing transgender women.
</p>
<p>
All vaginas have a ‘natural odour’ especially depending upon what part of the cycle is present.  Years ago there was a rumour running rampant on the Internet that sigmoid colon vaginoplasty was responsible for smelly discharge.  ALL forms of vaginoplasty produce some kind of unpleasant discharge at one point or another in the healing process.  The colon is additionally irrigated to remove any possible ‘dirt’ in addition to the prep the patient has to endure prior to the operation.  After completion the portion of the colon is no longer part of the digestive system hence it can not produce an ongoing smell associated with the digestive system.  This myth in some cases was perpetrated by doctors offering alternative forms of vaginoplasty as by those ignorant souls that figured they would just go along and promote this lie.  Hence, this damaged the reputation of doctors providing this form of vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
The ‘thesis’ was also written 14 years ago and does not offer up to date data on the outcomes of those that have experienced sigmoid colon vaginoplasty since then.  Outcomes have improved in the past 14 years.  I suggest any trans girl looking at this option use more recent and up to date studies looking at the outcomes.  Some surgeons are better than others.  That’s a fact of life like with any profession.  Some are just better than others!  Do your research!!!!!! I can not stress this enough:  Find the best technique for you then find the best surgeon you feel the most comfortable with then GO FOR IT!
</p>
<p>
I’m not an expert but just a trans girl that takes my health and my options seriously!  Feel free to PM me on this topic.
</p>
<p>
I thank you for providing this reference in that in order for us to increase our knowledge I believe it is important for us to examine all of the available studies and literature in order that we can self educate ourselves as a population.  Lord knows that the vast medical profession as a whole as let us down!  Don’t get me wrong…..there are a few angels out there for sure!  We love you!!  Every one of you!!

Fellow Ontarian here. Do you mind me asking where you went for SRS hair removal assuming it&#39;s in the GTA? Did you get laser or electrolysis for the peritoneal flap method? Thanks.

Yes I&#39;m in Toronto. May I ask if it was very painful to get electrolysis in the genital region for SRS? I need to get hair removal for my own SRS but I&#39;ve kept delaying it due to fear and low pain tolerance. How frequent and how many sessions did you go through until you were completely cleared for surgery? Much appreciated ❤️

it was really painful until i brought my own numbing cream in and asked her to use it. then it wasn&#39;t bad.
</p>
<p>
i had it every 2 weeks for about a year, and she didnt do the entire pubic hair area, just a tiny zone that was absolutely required.

Soooo amazing!! :D How did you get OHIP to cover it? Was it because you needed something that Montreal wasn&#39;t able to do or did you just ask really nicely? I&#39;m in BC and I was told HIBC doesn&#39;t approve out-of-country surgeons based on preference only &#34;medical need&#34;. But the Crane centre is high on my list of places I would love to go if I could!

I had a feeling that might have been the reason. Well congrats on both the surgery and the early blockers then!!
