Anyone been to Cleveland clinic and used dr. Zins for ffs? Any feedback?? He didn’t suggest anything other than age related. Should I be disappointed?

Maybe he thinks you already pass and surgery won’t help. If your transition has been recent it may be a mental matter of allowing your mind to catch up to how others already perceive you. Especially if you’ve lived a lifetime as a different person. I don’t think you should be disappointed, it seems like more of a compliment than anything. I don’t know if that resonates. Best!

Thats a kind comment.. it is very hard to see myself anew. Years of living as male. Very perceptive of you. Thanks. I guess I see how difficult it is for people and feel i need the same amount of hurdles to leap.

Some things that seemed to really help transitioning are: time to get to know the new you and adjust to yourself, getting new gendered clothes and getting rid of the old ones, getting a good gender specific name and ensuring everyone around you uses it (and reminding those who forget, they will, and cutting out those who are malicious about not using it), allowing time get a nice gendered hairstyle, going out as the new you regardless of if it’s uncomfortable at first, and getting the legal name and gender change if possible. It seems these really help and doing these first and as quickly as you can may be sufficient. Don’t wait! If you have a close supportive friend or someone, they maybe able to help you go out together and really help you rock the new you and help you build your confidence. I know it can be scary but people (and you) can come around pretty quick, there will be reminders of your old self but with time that person will seem like a stranger of the past. Some people give some years to transition fully and be fully out until considering surgery, and some never go that route, others do even after a decade. Whatever you choose, I suggest making an informed decision and weigh the risks / rewards, even surgery takes time to recover. Best!

Have you considered getting another surgical consult? Facialteam for instance offers free surgical consults and that may be a good place to start for a second opinion.

I think it’s more that I don’t find myself attractive.  I’ve been living stealth successfully for the most part

I’m having ffs with him next month. My PCP who prescribes my hormones recommended him based on a few of her other patients who have been pleased with the results. I was also a little surprised by a couple of his suggestions (I ultimately decided againt lipo, for example, because it seemed more age related than having anything to do with passing) and he advised against some of the procedures I wanted. Send me a message and I can let you know how it goes!
