I’m nearly 2 years post (Ting did mine), and I have the same thing — within days, I couldn’t recall what it had felt like to have the old equipment. My brain pretty much instantly recognized the new parts as what was always supposed to have been there, and I’ve had zero genital dysphoria since the surgery.
</p>
<p>
But I still get butterflies in my tummy when I think to myself: “my vagina”! It’s amazing!

Yeah someone asked me recently (I’m very open about being trans when I’m at work) about if I had “the Surgery.”
</p>
<p>
I live in an ass-backwards state but I figure engaging with people helps them understand is and I can correct misconceptions.
</p>
<p>
So I told them that yes, I had. They were curious about how my life has changed.
</p>
<p>
So I told them about not hearing “the buzz” that I was only aware of
<em>
after
</em>
surgery. I told them about no longer feeling assaulted by my own body. And I told them about how my brain already forgot what having the other equipment was like.

I love this attitude! I understand when some people are offended by people asking about what&#39;s in their pants but I also feel like it&#39;s more important for us out here in front of future generations to have some courage and positivity and answer those questions and help spread the knowledge about us.  I feel like a lot of phobia and discomfort that people have about people like us is simply because of a lack of knowledge. People tend to fear the unknown.

Yep. It’s why I’m open at work, have a very public Instagram, etc. burn away the darkness of ignorance.

Same. It’s part of why I’m pretty much an open book both online and in-person — I want to demystify trans people to the general public, and one of the best ways
<em>
I
</em>
can do that is to be visible and open about my own experiences. If I can be an example/representation for someone still in the closet, then perhaps I can help them feel less alone, and if they see my openness then perhaps they’ll be encouraged to speak up and make a connection. I’ve not been aware of anyone being in the closet (though I’ve occasionally had my suspicions 😀), but I have had the honor of meeting people who are in the process of coming out of the closet and sharing my experiences, and then becoming a cheerleader as they have made their own first steps (wow! It’s one of my favorite things, and such an honor to be present and supportive as they make such a fundamental proclamation about themselves, and step into their own truth!)
</p>
<p>
When interacting with someone who isn’t trans (at least that they or I know) and they ask a question like “surgery”, I’ll usually start with “I’m going to answer your question, but I want you to know that what you’re really asking about is what my genitals look like... that’s not something we typically ask other people, so please keep that in mind when you meet other trans people — it can be impolite to ask such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
I’m with you 100% on people being afraid of what they don’t know, and the answer to that is education. If that education isn’t coming from trans people (people who have lived these experiences), it might come from someone with an anti-trans attitude, and
<em>
I
</em>
cannot let that stand. I don’t expect any other trans people to share their own information and experiences, but if the choose to, I’m very glad for it. We can keep changing hearts and minds if we keep educating and showing that trans people are regular people, too.

They had that look of “I don’t know the feeling but I’m happy you’re happy.”
