With Skokan and Shane Morrison starting their bottom surgery clinic here in Seattle, I thought it would be a good time to leave a review about my experience.
</p>
<p>
Consultation:
</p>
<p>
Dr. Skokan was super kind and a female-presenting nurse was present for the entire consultation which eased my nerves a bit. We talked about all of the bottom surgery options available, he did an inspection to make sure I was a good candidate and we finished up in under an hour.
</p>
<p>
When I asked how many vaginoplasties they had performed in 2022, they had completed one so things are completely new. He said that he performs about 20 or so orchiectomies per year on the other hand.
</p>
<p>
The worst part of the whole experience was dealing with insurance which charged me a surprise $250 bill (a hospital fee because Dr. Skokan is contracted with them even though the consultation was not in a hospital. Gotta love US healthcare...)
</p>
<p>
Pre-Surgery Check-In:
</p>
<p>
This happened about a week prior to surgery and I discussed all of the details for arrival, showering and eating the day before. I stopped Spiro the day of. This was handled by a nurse if I remember correctly. I got hit with another surprise $200 &#34;hospital fee&#34; after.
</p>
<p>
Surgery Day:
</p>
<p>
I checked in, got taken back into the bed area where I changed into a gown and proceeded to get up to pee no less than four times lol. A bunch of people checked in with me ending with Dr. Skokan who then had me sign for surgery before being wheeled to the OR. I woke up and immediately felt a bit lighter (physically and emotionally) knowing they were finally gone.
</p>
<p>
Recovery:
</p>
<p>
Was super easy. The first day I cycled the Ibuprofen and Tylenol as directed and by day 2, I was able to stop all meds. I mostly had soreness in the inguinal canal area on both outer sides of the groin. By the 10th day or so I was basically back to normal and had to remind myself to not exert myself too much or swim. I was doing gymnastics and skateboarding before 14 days. Overall, it was a super speedy recovery with very little scarring. By the 6 week follow-up appointment, I was doing so well I decided to skip the appointment (and hospital fees).
</p>
<p>
It was recommended that I wait 6 weeks to do any sex stuff (masturbation included). I tried gently on day 3 (following the advice of reddit) and had no issues.
</p>
<p>
Cost:
</p>
<p>
$12,597.54 before insurance. Thankfully I was on Medicaid at the time and my current cost so far is the $500 for the consultation and pre-surgery check-in.
</p>
<p>
Opinion:
</p>
<p>
One of the best decisions I&#39;ve ever made. Tucking is a cinch, clothing fits amazing, and the face changes have been incredible. Highly recommend 11/10. My estrogen levels are still not where they need to be (hovering around 60) but my T nuked to sub 20. The skin all over my body has softened considerably as well.
</p>
<p>
Pictures:
</p>
<p>
The picture below shows the half-inch stitches that dissolve out over the next couple of weeks. Because Dr. Skokan does full bottom surgery, he knows how to keep scarring minimal in case patients want to opt for a vaginoplasty later (which is awesome).
