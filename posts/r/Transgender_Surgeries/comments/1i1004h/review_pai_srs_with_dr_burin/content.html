<p>
I am MTF trans woman in my 30&#39;s and 4 weeks out after getting the Penile Skin Inversion with Scrotal Skin Graft from Doctor Burin at Preecha Aesthetica Institute (PAI) in Bangkok, Thailand.
</p>
<p>
Charee with
<a href="https://www.transgendersurgerythailand.com/our-services.html">Esthetica Thailandia
</a>
was my consultant/agent and she was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. I came to Thailand with my best friend and we got surgery on back-to-back days and stayed in a hotel together to save money. I can give insight from both of our experiences.
</p>
<p>
I will outline some major points and I can also answer questions if you have any. I will not be posting pictures.
</p>
<p>
COST: For TWO people, the total cost of the entire trip has been ~ 30,000 USD. This includes the plane tickets, staying in hotel for 6 weeks, eating out every day, recovery supplies, and the surgery cost. There was an additional 1,000 USD fee from PAI on top of the ~10,000 USD surgery cost because I weigh over 100 kilograms. Still very affordable compared to most other options.
</p>
<p>
LOGISTICS: Charee and PAI have taken care of basically all the logistics besides scheduling plane tickets. Every car ride to/from the hotel to hospital or clinic was free and scheduled by them. Pickup/dropoff at airport was scheduled by Charee. Charee took care of booking the hotel so all we had to do was walk up and pay and get the key. Because I have ADD and executive function disorder, this has been so incredibly helpful.
</p>
<p>
Doctor Burin is so chill and very very experienced. He has done so many of these surgeries and his calm demeanor and depth of knowledge was very reassuring. I felt like I could just trust him to do what he thought would be best for my body and I&#39;m very glad that I did. This was incredibly refreshing after coming from US healthcare system which is actively hostile to patients.
</p>
<p>
AESTHETICS: After 4 weeks I am already satisfied with the &#34;look&#34; of it. All of the major parts are there and it looks pretty close to a cis womans already, im sure it will only look better as the swelling goes down and the scars fade away. Same goes for my friend.
</p>
<p>
FUNCTION: I have almost 7&#34; of depth despite having a below-average penis size before. I am 180cm tall. My clitoris is extremely sensitive and, although I am not supposed to masturbate yet, some light rubbing is already very pleasurable and I look forward to exploring more after a few more months. My friend has 6.5&#34; depth and is 175cm tall, she also had what would be considered a small penis before the operation.
</p>
<p>
PAIN: Immediately after the surgery the pain was very well managed because they set me up with morphine drip bags for the first 3 days. Coming from the US &#34;healthcare&#34; system where you have to beg for painkillers this was great. The transition to Tramadol was a bit rough as I still had the packing in until day 4 or 5 (cant remember exactly it was a blur).
</p>
<p>
The packing plus catheter was pretty rough. After getting those removed and going back to the hotel I tried to transition to paracetemol (tylenol) but it wasnt cutting it. Thankfully tramadol is available OTC in most of the pharmacies here so I have been able to use that to manage the pain very well. If I fell off my tramadol schedule the pain was basically unbearable for the first week and a half after leaving the hospital. Im still using tramadol daily.
</p>
<p>
COMPLICATIONS:  I basically had no major complications besides excessive swelling and the pain of course. I have an auto-immune disorder that causes my body to swell more so this was expected.
</p>
<p>
My friend only had one complication which was a bit of necrosis. A thin long strand of white (dying/dead) flesh was hanging out of her vagina. It was a few inches long and she affectionately referred to it as &#34;the slug&#34;. It was pretty gross. After it became too uncomfortable, she contacted Charee about it and the next morning Doctor Burin had her in the clinic to remove most of it. He said the remainder will fall off on its own over time and its best to let that happen on its own and clean it.
</p>
<p>
DILATION: Its been pretty easy so far. Im only required to do it twice a day and theres no problems for me or my friend. I still need to take a small dose of valium about 30 minutes before dilation to help relax my muscles. After I ran out at one point, all I had to do was message Charee and PAI delivered the medication to my hotel the same day. I&#39;m already up to the 32mm diameter dilator and have kept my depth. I will try the 34mm one at the 5 week mark.
</p>
<p>
RECOVERY: I have had FFS and Top Surgery before getting SRS. I would say the recovery has been more difficult than top surgery but easier than FFS. The major caution I would say is that this surgery is not for the faint of heart. It is really quite gross having random fluids leaking from vagina. The recovery process requires being consistent with keeping good hygiene and cleanings in a way that neither of those surgeries required. Having to dilate twice a day for 6 months is obviously a long term commitment.
</p>
<p>
THAILAND: Bangkok is great. Food is cheap if you go away from the tourist areas and I&#39;ve never once felt unsafe here on the entire trip. I was able to go out exploring the city at about 3 weeks after surgery.
</p>
<p>
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS:
</p>
<p>
I enthusastically recommend Dr Burin, Charee, and PAI.  I am very satisfied with the results of the surgery and the entire process.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the recovery, I could message Charee at any time of the day and she would either respond in minutes or within just a few hours if it was the middle of the night. She knows a lot about this process and has a direct line to PAI for anything I have needed. She was also present at all my pre-op and post-op appointments with exception of when I was in the hospital. Because I&#39;m her client she has assured me that I can message her even after I return to the states for medical advice related to recovery.
</p>
<p>
My only regret is that I have to go back to the US shortly!

Congratulations. As a daughter of Thailand and PAI clinic under the direction of Dr Burin, the past 12 years have been wonderful. I did do a little revision as I healed a bit differently but that was easily taken cared of at Kaiser here in hawaii.. I will never regret doing my surgery in Thailand. There is an energy there that just filled me up with love and healing . It was so transformative both physically and spiritually. And as we all know, there level of care and bedside manner is absolutely fabulous.

Thank you so much for this info. So glad it went well for you two. Iâ€™m going to surgery with Dr. Sutin tomorrow. May I ask why you stayed four weeks? Did you choose to or was it requested by Dr. Burin?

Good luck with your surgery!
</p>
<p>
My FFS surgery recovery was really difficult so I thought extra time was a better option. Also I determined that it was cheaper to stay for the extra time and make sure I am recovered before the long flight than to upgrade my plane tickets to business class for comfort. Im so glad I stayed the extra time! Recovery in the hotel has been great. Hopefully economy class will be tolerable after this time recovering.

I would email Charee at
<a href="https://www.transgendersurgerythailand.com/our-services.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.transgendersurgerythailand.com/our-services.html
</a>
and ask her. I know the PAI clinic has a whole portfolio of pictures that Dr. Burin showed me when I was at the office.
</p>
<p>
You could also email PAI directly.

I wish weâ€™d see more results on Reddit from burin patients. Thereâ€™s not a lot of people posting their post op results. But congratulations anyway!

How are you feeling?? How  long was it for you from first outreach to PAI or Charee to consult and then to surgery? How much did you pay?

Im at week 6 now and feeling much more mobile and active. I am now entering the phase of what I&#39;m calling &#34;lightning crotch&#34; where nerves are reconnecting and I get little blasts of lightning a few times a day.
</p>
<p>
The flight back was an awful experience and I wish I could afford business class or a direct flight. I unfortunately live in a small town so it was 4 different flights for me to get home so I went 3 days without dilating or cleaning the new kitty.
</p>
<p>
I scheduled with Charee 11 months in advance because I knew this time last year that December 2024 was going to be the only time I could make this work. I have heard some people are able to schedule as little as 3 months out though.
</p>
<p>
My total cost to PAI was 10,230 USD.

The cost included the surgery and all the pre op and post-op op visits and the hospital stay.
</p>
<p>
It was another 5000 for me for plane tickets and hotel and food and recovery supplies. I stayed in a more expensive hotel for 6 weeks.
