Absolutely. If not only because his work is amazing, but the entire staff at UCHealth was incredible. I was in the hospital for 6 days, and every nurse was just the nicest and most accommodating person. Never once felt uncomfortable or was misgendered. 10/10 hospital stay.
</p>
<p>
Dr. K can be a little cold and professional, but he makes damn sure that you&#39;re happy and comfortable after. He visited me to check on the site and ask how I was doing several times when I was in the hospital. Dr. Higuchi, the urologist, is a gem as well. They work very well as a team.
</p>
<p>
Dr. K was trained by BBL and it shows. His waitlist is rather small right now because he&#39;s new, but I don&#39;t regret going with him in the slightest.

Thank you! I&#39;ll keep Dr. K in mind if I get that option.
</p>
<p>
Did you have to wait long for your first consultation? I was told the wait-list could be up to a few months.

I was already in the system so I think I was able to get in faster, but my initial wait for a consult was about a month, then about 3 months later I was getting the surgery :)

Awesome! That&#39;s around what I was thinking, if not sooner.  Were you able to go back to work after the 6 days in the hospital? Sorry for pestering you. Just really excited. : )

<p>
Thanks for all your help! Much Love! üíóü§çüíô

I definitely did NOT. I took a total of 3 weeks off from work and honestly could&#39;ve taken another if I had the PTO available.

I can&#39;t recommend Dr. K and the staff at UCHealth enough. Feel free to follow me, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll post an update here in the next few months :)

You are healing up amazingly!  Really looks like a beautiful result, congratulations!
</p>
<p>
I am officially just waiting for my final letters to get insurance approval and get on the schedule with Dr. K.  Hopefully will have a date in the next couple of weeks (I am expecting sometime in September at this point), then it will just be a matter of patiently impatiently waiting. üòä

Congrats again, and wishes for a continued smooth recovery.  üíúüíú

Just a follow-up FYI for those looking at UCH/Dr. K.  I *finally* got my surgery date - 5/12/2023!  It seems that he has gained popularity, and his schedule is reflecting that.   I had my consult with him back in February 2021 (yes, a year and a half ago) and then needed to get my hair removal completed which mostly wrapped up in June this year.  It took my  month and a half to finally get scheduled due to some apparent staff changes.  Still hoping that I will manage to get in a bit earlier with a cancellation, but at least there is a date on the calendar to look forward to. üòäüíúüíú

Once you get a consult scheduled, they should set you up on the UCHealth App.  This will let you track appointments.  You should go in there, and set the option to be notified if an earlier appointment time becomes available - and then pay attention to the notifications because open slots can go quickly.  My original appointment was supposed to be 6 months after I scheduled it, and they notified me a week later of an available time in one month which I was able to take.  It frequently isn&#39;t as long as you would think. üòä  If you are going with Dr. K (or really, most any other surgeon), I would suggest starting on hair removal if you haven&#39;t, since that is most definitely the longest part of the process in my experience.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes!  üíúüíú

Hey I&#39;ve got a vaginoplasty date for May 24th, 2024 with Dr. K. What are your thoughts &amp; updates since this post? I&#39;ve wanted a vagina since I was 10 and this is happening just before I turn 41. I&#39;ve been on HRT since October 2020 and doing the required electrolysis for over a year. Dr. K did a fantastic job with my BA &amp; I trust him. I guess I&#39;m just looking for any tips, tricks, things to watch out for, things they don&#39;t tell you, &amp; stuff like that. I&#39;m so freaking excited I can&#39;t wait!
