Hi everyone. I had my SRS with Dr. Pang in NYC end of October. Wondering experience, kind staff and Dr Pang exceeded my cosmetic look expectations. The recovery has not been easy for me, frankly I didn’t do much homework and expected to be able to resume normal activities one month post surgery, however still very sore. I travelled by plain yesterday and was able to lay flat during the flight but then lots of sitting in the car and been bleeding since the flight. Not crazy blood gushing, more like blood here and there on pads, during dilating and when using the bathroom. I’m really confused the clinic says it’s normal but it’s the first time in 6 weeks after surgery that I’m bleeding. My recovery been painful but blood free. Would love to hear from you gals, let me know about your experience (especially after travel). I’m frustrated with calling to the doctors office and hearing the same answer, I need more insights. Thank you 🙏🏼
