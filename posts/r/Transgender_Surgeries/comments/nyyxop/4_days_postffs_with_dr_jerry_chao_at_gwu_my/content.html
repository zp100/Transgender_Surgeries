Hi friends,
</p>
<p>
I am at home recovering from FFS with Dr. Jerry Chao. I had a type 3 brow reduction, brow lift, and genioplasty. Here is my experience because there&#39;s not a lot out there about Dr. Chao and he made the experience smooth, so I wanted to help people looking for more east coast options.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Choosing Dr. Chao
</strong>
I picked Dr. Chao for a few reasons. First, he was in network on my insurance, which was awesome. Second, his office is about a half hour away from my apartment, which is awesome. But in addition to those things, he also has extensive training in reconstructive plastics, is board certified, and has a number of publications on the topic, including one specifically on the Asian face. This, combined with a lot of Black and Asian clients in before/after photos that he showed me, left me confident that he wouldn&#39;t prioritize Caucasian beauty standards in his FFS, something I was desperately trying to avoid as a South Asian person.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cost
</strong>
Dr. Chao was in network with my insurance plan, CareFirst BCBS. They approved it right away and I ended up paying around $1500 total for my hospital stay copays, prep visits, and supplies. (It would have been cheaper if the hospital staff had not messed up...) Extremely affordable, I&#39;m a grad student so it was very nice to have a realistic option who took my insurance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Prep
</strong>
I am a DC native so getting to Dr. Chao&#39;s office was very fast on the Metro for me. At the initial consult he showed me some before/after photos and explained the procedures each person had done. He took some photos of my face from different angles, and ordered bloodwork labs and a CT scan of my head. There is a LabCorp in his office building so I just had to go downstairs to take labs. I got the CT scan from a GWU imaging clinic in another part of the city.
</p>
<p>
After looking at the CT scan we discussed options. I mentioned that my biggest focal point I wanted changed was my jaw, and then my brow secondarily. He agreed, and put forward the idea of a rhinoplasty as a third option, but he also said he prefers to do FFS in stages to allow for recovery time in between procedures and will work on only two areas at a time in most cases, and that a rhinoplasty would be best done as a later procedure since given my face it wouldn&#39;t be as impactful as the two areas I wanted done. Knowing that, I asked for my two primary preference areas first and he agreed.
</p>
<p>
I needed a type 3 brow reduction because of the location of my sinuses. I also was put down for a mandible reduction osteotomy where they slide portions of the jaw. Dr. Chao uses titanium screws for both of these for the added stability they provide so that is something to consider. He had the CT scan so he knew where all of the nerves and arteries would be so as to be aggressive without being risky.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day of Surgery
</strong>
I took the Metro to my surgery. They let you arrive alone but you need a caregiver to pick you up. I had to be there at 6:30 AM since it was such a long procedure. I went into the surgical prep room almost immediately and went through registration with the nurses. (There was a trans guy in the next bed over having top surgery that day with Dr. Ramineni, which was a funny coincidence.)
</p>
<p>
Dr. Chao eventually came in and debriefed me on the procedures he&#39;d be doing. When I confirmed I was comfy with everything happening, I was given an IV and then taken into surgery. Anesthesia hit quickly and I was out like a light.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Post-Op Stay
</strong>
When I came to in the room, the first thing I noticed was that my face felt like I was a Binding of Isaac character after a handful of items. I was
<em>
unbelievably
</em>
swollen, moreso than I had heard of anyone being swollen post FFS. I noticed something
<em>
immediately
</em>
wrong. It felt like there was some hair or tape or
<em>
something
</em>
stuck in the inside of my left eye, and it hurt tremendously to open or move the eyeball. So I was one eyed for that day, and I had to physically hold that one eye open with two fingers because of how ridiculously puffy it was,
<em>
and
</em>
I had to angle my whole head to see since... eyes turn together and turning my good eye meant turning my painful one. I learned the next day from the opthalmologist that this was a corneal scratch from eye shielding during the surgery, and I was given fake tears and eye ointment to be applied four times daily. This never happened. My eye ointment was applied once during the whole hospital stay, and it was by the plastics nurses Paige and Brock who are part of Dr. Chao&#39;s plastics care team and shouldn&#39;t have had to do my upkeep meds at all. They only did it when they learned that the ward nurses weren&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I opened my mouth to speak and hurled a ton of blood instead. That was lovely.
</p>
<p>
A ward nurse gave me a Lovenox injection to prevent leg clots because I was going to be in the hospital bed overnight.
<em>
This turned out to be the biggest mistake of the night.
</em>
My body responded way, way too well to the blood thinner and my surgical wounds were pouring blood all night, to the point of soaking the poor staff&#39;s hands when they changed my bandages and jaw-bra. Dr. Chao came in to look and said that it was extremely abnormal to bleed this much post FFS and he would be holding me another day in the hospital for observation, this time without Lovenox. The Plastics care team also stitched shut two of the biggest wounds, both on the left side of my scalp.
</p>
<p>
Even simple tasks I had a hard time getting ward nurses to do and had to either dump them on the poor plastics care team or do them myself as best I could. My eye ointment was applied by myself all but once. The Bacitracin meant for my surgical wounds on my scalp was just slathered on my cheeks by one ward nurse. My leg compression machine was erroring out after two to four compressions and stopping; every nurse I asked just restarted it without addressing the problem, and I ended up dragging the terminal over to my bed and just answering the prompts myself with one eye. (My CS major skills finally came in handy!) The biggest insult: a night ward nurse tried to give me
<strong>
another Lovenox shot
</strong>
at 2 AM, directly contradicting the surgeon&#39;s orders and my own gut instinct. I refused the shot.
<strong>
There was no communication between Dr. Chao&#39;s team, who knew exactly what to do, and the hospital nurses on duty, who just stuck with protocol.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After another rough night, I woke up to find that the bleeding had stopped. Unfortunately, I lost almost two whole
<em>
pints
</em>
of blood to the ordeal, and needed a blood transfusion badly. I signed the consent and waited for my body to vamp up all the blood, after which I was finally discharged and allowed to go home, after a grueling 60 hour hospital stay.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Results
</strong>
That was two days ago. I&#39;m still swollen as all fuck. However, even through the extreme swelling, my jaw is
<em>
still
</em>
much softer than it was before; probably because it was so damn Crimson Chin huge beforehand, but it looks far, far better than it did. My brow also doesn&#39;t have that hooded bulge to it that it used to; it&#39;s swollen too, though not as ridiculously as my cartoonishly ballooned cheeks. Once this post op swelling goes down some more I can give before/after pics, but even just the cursory results look good.
</p>
<p>
My cornea healed after a few days of ointment and I can finally use both eyes again normally! No more individually holding open each eye, thank fuck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall
</strong>
I&#39;m pleased with the work and with Dr. Chao and the Plastics care team. They were super sweet and attentive, never once misgendered me (I am nonbinary and use they/them), and responded quickly and decisively when unexpected things occurred. Dr. Chao especially took a lot of efforts to mitigate risk; if I had to deal with rhinoplasty recovery and being unable to breathe through my nose on top of everything I had in that brutal hospital stay, I would have honestly had a fucking massive breakdown. But since it was just 2 areas, I could compartmentalize the recovery. And given that the ward nurses seemed to be confused as heck and I had to take charge of a lot of my own care, I&#39;m grateful for that.
</p>
<p>
This wasnt my first time with a surgeon at GWUH; I had an orchiectomy there with Dr. Phillips in 2019. That one didn&#39;t require an overnight stay and was a much smoother surgery by nature, but it helped me having some experience under my belt; if FFS was my first surgery ever you&#39;d be dragging me kicking and screaming into that OR for anything else.
</p>
<p>
The experience definitely sucked a lot, but it wasn&#39;t really Dr. Chao&#39;s fault. He wrote all my orders in my file and on the whiteboard in my room. The ward staff just didn&#39;t read any of the damn things. If that bit of the experience was improved even a little bit then, results pending, I&#39;d call this a premier FFS experience.

I’m a cisgendered female but I still went to Dr. Chao for my jaw and chin reduction and I have zero regrets 🥺🥺🥺 I’m 17 weeks post-op and he did EXACTLY what I asked for and I came out of the procedure with zero complications, I mean none. My recovery was amazing and he’s just an overall amazing doctor. I wish you had an amazing experience like me but I’m glad you chose Dr. Chao. I hope you’re healing fine and the recovery process is going okay!!

Thanks for this post! Just had a chin reduction done as well! Can you tell me more about your recovery? I’m about 4 weeks post op and my bottom lip is still tight making my smile a little weird. And I’m definitely still swollen. When did you start seeing your final results and get feeling back in your chin and lip?

So my doctor said I won’t see my desired results until September, which will make it 6.5 months after my surgery. Initially, I first started seeing the results after about 12 weeks. I’m still swollen now, but it isn’t noticeable to anyone at all except for me. As for the smiling part, my bottom lip and lower gums still feel tight when I really think about. I think I’ve been so accustomed to it feeling like this, it honestly feels normal (not before surgery normal but just what I’m used to now.) I’m 19 weeks post-op now and like I said, I still feel tightness in my lower lip and gums, so just expect it! It’s totally comfortable tho, you won’t even realize until someone asks about your recovery and mentions it like you just did, lol!  I started getting the feeling back in my chin and lip I’d say about after 10 weeks. If you wanna read more about my recovery, I have some post on my page that explains a little more. I hope I was able to help a little bit and I wish you a speedy recovery!

Thank you so so much for your response! It’s so helpful! I’m staring to get some of that tingling sensation back in my chin and lip. My issue is my bottom lip doesn’t move much when I smile which is just annoying and looks kinda weird. Definitely still tight like you said. Hoping that comes back soon.

You’re so welcome!! The tingling sensation was sooooo annoying the first I’d say 6 weeks and then it started to feel a little better after that. I had to ask my surgeon to prescribe me medicine for the tingling feeling and he gave me Gabapentin. That medicine is supposed to calm your nerves and minimize the feeling, but I honestly didn’t really tell a difference but everyone reacts differently to thing. You’re still suppppper early in your recovery process, so give it time!! I cannot give you an explanation as to why your lip barely moves as it didn’t happen to me .😭 I’m not sure if this is normal bc my bottom lip functioned normally after the swelling from it decreased, so maybe you should ask your doctor! They will most likely say you are so early on, wait until 12 weeks to start seeing your first set of results and how your smile and everything else looks. Before my surgery, my doctor did warn me asymmetry can occur depending on how the surgery goes in some cases, so consult with your surgeon and hopefully he can assure you everything will be fine! 🥰

Great writeup. Does he do incisions in the hairline or alongside it. I want alongside. So I hopefully don&#39;t lose hair from the incision. I have a ton of hair but I want to keep it that way lol

Currently none. I&#39;ve been making an effort to prevent dried blood clumping in my hair as much as possible by using baby conditioner to gently rinse the tangled ends. When the staples come out in two days I&#39;ll see if it worsens.

Good luck. Cortisol is what does it, so I&#39;ve read so keep your mind at ease.

Care First BCBS. I had a bill of about $4k but I had met my OOP maximum for other things so I got it almost entirely covered.

For the jaw reduction, does he go in through the mouth? I have a real problem with scarring so cutting into my skin is never going to happen.

He does go in through the mouth but the drains have to be placed externally. So any scars you get will come from those
