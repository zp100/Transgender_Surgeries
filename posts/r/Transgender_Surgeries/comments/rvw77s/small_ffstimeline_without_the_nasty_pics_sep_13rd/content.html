Do your research well if you plan to go to him. He has botched many and risked the lives of some of his patients. A 50/50 surgeon. He must be stepping his game up now since he has got so many complaints and lawsuits.

Just absolutely WOW and you are SO pretty. The changes are astounding. The shape of your chin, and the feminizing of your nose and forehead are wonderful.  I&#39;m guessing you had jaw reduction too?
</p>
<p>
I have three consults coming up between two weeks out and the end of March. Your results give me SO much hope. If I could get a fraction of the changes that you got, it would push me over the top!
</p>
<p>
My question for you has to do with your self impression of your face. Presently, I struggle to see the woman in me staring into the mirror. I had one occasion where I saw her 100% and it was the most gender euphoric moment of my life. She&#39;s gone back into hiding and all I see is a man in the reflection. It is really hard and dysphoric. This mental gymnastics trying to accept whole heartedly I&#39;m a woman while I look so manly is draining. A friend that had FFS said afterward that the gymnastics just disappears and the feeling that of being a woman no longer requires any (as much) effort. How has that experience been for you.

Thank you so much for your words &lt;3 and yes, I had a jaw reduction as well :)
</p>
<p>
To your question:
</p>
<p>
I so understand what you&#39;re saying, because it was exact the same way I felt before the FFS and that was the main reason why I decided to do it. Especially my profile kicked up that dysphoria so often that I just had to do something against it because it made me insecure outside.
</p>
<p>
As the healing process does, the process of realization also takes time. I had and still have sometimes flashbacks as my brain tries to see the old face, like a phantom pain, a memory, but it&#39;s not there anymore and by now even without makeup I see the female face belonging to my female self more often and the flashbacks tend to get MUCH less frequently.
</p>
<p>
To be frank: Dysphoria is still there but it&#39;s way more managable and is already getting less and less over time, hopefully will fade to zero becaue I&#39;m only 14 month into HRT so there will be some more progress :)
</p>
<p>
If you have similar feelings that I had prior to the surgery you won&#39;t regret it :)
<br>
I wish you all the best luck!

Thank you so much :) I really love the changes so far and am really eager to see where the HRT and the healing process will take me, because it might take up to one year or even more to fully recover from that surgery.
</p>
<p>
What my surgeon has done for me: Type 3 forehead reconstruction with browlift and hairline reduction, rhino with nasiolabial implants for the cheecks, upper liplift, chin reconturing and jawline reduction with suction beneath the chin area :)
</p>
<p>
How my recovery went:
</p>
<p>
At first: I&#39;m stubborn - that&#39;s why I already went around on the station on the day of my surgery (was in the early morning, was done around early afternoon). There are several things that annoyed me and were hard to take, but the pain was managable because of several reasons: Cooling, pain medication and because parts of my foreheads, scalp and chin were severed from the bone with cutting all the nerves over there, so I really didn&#39;t feel anything there.
</p>
<p>
The first thing that I really felt was the pressure on my face, especially the chin, mouth and nose area. My lips were swollen heavily, my nose was tamponaded so I couldn&#39;t breath properly and while eating soup I was leaking and I really hated it. That got worse until day two / three after the surgery. From then on It got better bit by bit every day (as you can see top center picture, I was able to close my lips again on that day). The movement of my jaw was hard and that I couldn&#39;t move my face properly. It was a weird experience when I didn&#39;t feel the shower on my head and that&#39;s why I got my face wet although I shouldn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t sense where the water stream was.
</p>
<p>
Pain was there, yes, definitely, but the moment I got uneasy with it I took my pain meds and after a week I didn&#39;t need them anymore.
</p>
<p>
Today, nearly four month after, I still feel the swelling in my nose (especially the tip) but all feeling to scalp, chin and forehead have already returned. Breathing through my nose is still somewhat difficult because I had an infection of that nostril after my return to home...
</p>
<p>
The movement of my jaw sometimes feels a bit weird, so does the forehead but I&#39;m able to move everything like I was prior to the surgery.
</p>
<p>
When I can give some advice: Be patient with the healing because I seem to be quick in healing process (as my surgeon said). Especially in the first few days rest, cooling and taking your meds will be crucial. Those first few days are hard, I heard two other girl crying because of their pain over night. Another one was blinded for the first four days because of the swelling of her brow area, but the time this receded it got better again.
</p>
<p>
As we are different, so our recovery is :) In the end, it&#39;s definitely worth it!
