I&#39;m considering using PriyaMed for BA, FFS, and PPV.  I am interested in any prior patients reviews and result pictures.

I&#39;m going out for my FFS with them in March and I can honestly say Jane has been wonderful so far. We&#39;ve spent hours video chatting so I feel like I know her already and she&#39;s lovely. She&#39;s run me through live VFFS over video and every doubt or confusion of mine, she&#39;s put at ease. I&#39;m also very impressed by how thorough the booking process is!

Yes it is.  Trying to find any and all information.  It all seems hear say and rumors.  Any verified info has been nearly impossible to acquire.

There&#39;s another thread here asking about PriyaMED, where I just commented.
</p>
<p>
You can find reviews of PriyaMED on this private Facebook surgery group.  That&#39;s where PriyaMED does a lot of its promotion and a lot of people post reviews there as well.  PriyaMED is a medical tourism company in Mumbai, India, run by a British trans woman.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TransitionSurgery/" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/groups/TransitionSurgery/</a>
</p>
<p>
One girl in particular had a horrible experience there, her surgery was botched.  She suffered a bad infection during surgery, and during recovery was in great pain.  The owner of PriyaMED, who is not a medical professional, was abusive to her and her infection went untreated.  When she arrived back in her home country, she was immediately hospitalized in the infectious diseases unit for almost a week to treat the superbug that she had acquired at PriyaMED.  She had sepsis and a kidney infection.  She said that afterwards she was left with a vagina with no depth that doesn&#39;t look good cosmetically.
</p>
<p>
There are other commenters who also talk about poor surgical results, unprofessional and abusive behavior by the owner of PriyaMED, public posting of privileged medical information by the owner of PriyaMED, and needing to have multiple revisions with other surgeons to repair what was done with PriyaMED.  There are also positive reviews of PriyaMED.

The fewer reviews there are the more risk. That’s the good thing about some of the thai surgeons, there’s so many reviews that you can form a reasonably accurate idea of how good they are, or not. Hence people mostly go there for srs and not ffs.
</p>
<p>
India doesn’t have that yet.
