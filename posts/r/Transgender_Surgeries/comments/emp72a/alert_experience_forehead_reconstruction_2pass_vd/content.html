<strong>
UPDATED CONTENT
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I want to add that I do life coaching sometimes combined with going with the client to the surgery planned. Based on my personal experience and staying at hospitals and clinics for sometimes a longer time I do have extensive first-hand experience when it comes to surgery and results - and that is why there is a selection of surgeons I highly advise and those I recommend to stay away from. This concludes that for me there is no &#34;best surgeon/ best hospital&#34;. For me there is a range of surgeons/hospitals that one can choose from - so as opposed to Dr. v.d. Ven&#39;s claim that I am working for or are affiliated with Facialteam  - this claim is false. They performed my FFS, yes - that is my personal FFS experience and one of the reasons why I recommend them - but even in this post I list alternatives that I believe to be some of the best FFS surgeon choices possible.
</p>
<p>
The following happened in November/ December 2019 to a patient I met at Kamol Hospital Bangkok and I was an eyewitness for the whole incident.
</p>
<p>
This patient went to Kamol for a Sigma-Queen GCS/SRS and was looking for FFS revision options of her previous FFS from May 2018 which was performed at 2Pass Belgium by Dr. v. d. Ven. She wasn‘t quite happy with the rhinoplasty and was looking into other procedures to further feminize her face.
</p>
<p>
Before discussing options a 3D x-ray was performed to properly evaluate the status quo. Instead of visualizing the reattached sinus plate an uneven-surface bone cement filling was exposed and visible instead - thus giving proof to the fact that this patient had no type III forehead reconstruction - as she had believed - but a type IV forehead reconstruction got performed on her instead without her knowledge or consent.
</p>
<p>
The type IV forehead reconstruction greatly differs from a type III reconstruction. The type IV reconstruction includes the total removal of the mucous lining of the frontal sinus and the complete filling of the sinus cavity with bone cement.
</p>
<p>
The patient, residing in Switzerland, had absolutely no knowledge of this fact.
</p>
<p>
She was wondering why ever since her FFS with 2Pass/ v.d. Ven it was impossible for her  to use her head voice - now easily explained by the fact that the sinus resonance space wasn‘t available anymore. In addition to this fact she also started having problems with situations involving pressure changes such as flight descends/ ascends and quickly changing weather conditions involving drastic pressure changes - yet she never related those problems to her FFS since she believed herself to have received a type III forehead reconstruction, which leaves the frontal sinus completely intact and functional.
</p>
<p>
Regular medical knowledge still has no further insight into what the frontal sinus is good for/ needed for besides the two elements mentioned here.
</p>
<p>
Put onto the spot Dr. v.d. Ven claimed that &#34; the frontal sinus has no function at all and can be obliterated.&#34;
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The surgeon performed a surgical step that the patient neither agreed to nor authorized him to do and the type IV procedure was not explained to the patient.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The 2Pass website explains the type III and type IV forehead reconstruction types here:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://2pass.clinic/en/ffs/procedures/brow-bone-reduction">https://2pass.clinic/en/ffs/procedures/brow-bone-reduction
</a>
</p>
<p>
(Please scroll down to the appropriate term).
</p>
<p>
A thorough evaluation of the patient‘s invoice revealed, that on the procedure list column on the left-hand side of the invoice it says: type III forehead reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The column on the right-hand side which notes &#34;Material&#34; (needed) it says hydroset/ Stryker bone cement.
</p>
<p>
Besides that this can so easily be read over by regular patients - it seems to me it is set up to lure the patient into something that doesn‘t exist: a type III forehead reconstruction where bone cement is being used.
</p>
<p>
The only viable explanation for this mix up of terms, meaning, and content is intentional fraud by the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The Belgian ministry of health already got informed of this incident - measures are being taken at the moment. Dr. v.d. Ven quickly set up a lawyer to deal with the client intended to shut her up from spreading the details of this case - threatening her with legal action should she publish details.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The 2Pass client now aims for compensation and/ or solatium - which the surgeons asked his lawyer to interpret as blackmail.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The response received by the Belgian Ministry of Health contained the following information:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ol>
<li>
​
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Dr. v.d. Ven is registered in Belgium as a doctor for oral cavity and jaw which is generally labeled dentist.
</p>
<p>
2)
</p>
<p>
The Royal Belgian Society of Plastic Surgeons (RBSPS) doesn‘t have a member/ registration  by the name of Dr. v.d. Ven.
</p>
<p>
3)
</p>
<p>
2Pass Clinic is registered to the name of Dr. v.d. Ven‘s significant other: Ellen Defrancq, who is a registered member of the Royal Belgian Society of Plastic Surgeons (RBSPS).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Dr. v.d. Ven rejects any kind of liability or having made a mistake on his behalf denying any form of compensation/ solatium although he performed a surgical procedure that was neither properly explained, authorized, and agreed to by this patient.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Based on the responses received by Dr. v.d. Ven it is highly probable that quite a number of patients were operated that way since he stated he &#34;has performed this kind of surgery for years.&#34; So there is quite a big chance that patients who went to 2Pass/ v.d. Ven were operated with a type IV forehead reconstruction  but were explained, made believe, and promised a type III forehead reconstruction and for that reason now have a fully dysfunctional sinus and maybe even are confronted with further health problems than the ones that this patient suffers from.
</p>
<p>
Type IV forehead reconstruction is a much simpler, faster, less complication prone, and cheaper procedure, requiring less technique, skill and routine than a type III forehead reconstruction - so I guess it‘s safe to say that this was done especially when financial concessions were made - as it was the case with the patient dealing with this situation now.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The response letters of the surgeon are available on PM request - they draw a pretty clear picture.
</p>
<p>
Should there be other patients dealing with the same issue they can contact me via PM so maybe a class-action lawsuit might be filed.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
In case you wonder if this applies to you - a 3D-CT scan or a 3d x-ray will reveal the result of your forehead reconstruction and if a type III or type IV reconstruction procedure got performed. Dr. v. d. Ven states that these scans are completely unnecessary - at the same time using them for his trachea shave procedure. Since these scans reveal the true craftsmanship of the surgeon - and the true results of the bone work done I leave it up to you to interpret this surgeon‘s statement.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
True top surgeons like Facialteam, Dr. Spiegel, Dr. Kaushik or Dr. Keojempa see this as a necessity and also it‘s a huge help in explaining why which procedures are deemed useful and it will visually show you what will be done - and the post-op scans reveal what was done.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Had Dr. v. d. Ven stuck to the original plan and nomenclature used on the invoice/ price quote there would have been no reason for complaint since the targeted passing effect of the surgery was achieved but by using inadequate procedures the patient would have never agreed to had she known.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Now there is because the surgeon performed an unauthorized procedure with negative consequences at the physical  level using terminology that enables this kind of intentional fraud.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I am always ready to forward the respective emails and invoices via PM that verify the statements made in this post.
</p>
<p>

D. v.d. Ven responded to this post here:

</p>
<p>
Turning my post into a v.d. Ven/2Pass  vs. competitor war instead of proving his claims and statements in terms of the patient‘s issues and the current situation is a low-ball effort to discredit what was written.
</p>
<p>
The first email written to Dr. v.d. Ven on November 23rd 2019 is this email (it&#39;s in German - so please use a translator - basically it says that the patient is deeply disappointed and is asking for a way to solve her problems. ONLY AFTER Dr. v.d. Ven responded he will not be willing to provide a solution/ compensation/ solatium did the process escalate - opposed to what Dr. v.d. Ven writes in his post:

<p>
Sehr geehrter Herr Dr. Van de Ven
</p>
<p>
Ich möchte damit beginnen meine masslose Entäuschung hinsichtlich meiner Stirnrekonstruktion im Rahmen der von Ihnen durchgeführten FFS im Mai 2018 zum Ausdruck zu bringen. Ich habe nun den Eindruck, dass ich von Ihnen gezielt in die Irre geführt wurde, was die Stirnrekonstruktion betrifft.
</p>
<p>
Der Begriff Stirnrekonstruktion Typ 3 ist für gewöhnlich mit einer Rückverlegung des vorderen Sinusbereiches mit einem Abnehmen, dem Bearbeiten des Stirngebietes und einem Wiederanbringen der Sinusplatte reserviert.
</p>
<p>
Eine aktuelle 3D - Aufnahme meines Schädels zeigt ein vollständiges Ausfüllen meines gesamten vorderen Sinuses mit einem Werkstoff, vermutlich Knochenzement.
</p>
<p>
In keiner Phase der Konsultationen mit Ihnen, war von einer kompletten Entfernung der Sinusschleimhaut und das Auffüllen des gesamten Sinusbereiches je die Rede.
</p>
<p>
Niemals hätte ich einem solchen Vorgehen zugestimmt und ich habe den Eindruck dass ich von gezielt manipuliert wurde, in dem mir entscheidende Details bei der Beratung vorenthalten wurden!
</p>
<p>
Seit der FFS bei Ihnen ist es mir durch den fehlenden Resonanzraum unmöglich meine bis dahin vorhandene Kopfstimme einzusetzen. Vom Verlust eines entscheidenen Elements meines nasalen Funktionssystems ganz zu Schweigen.
</p>
<p>
Ich erwarte von Ihnen umgehend einen Vorschlag zur finanziellen Kompensation der durch diesen Sachverhalt verursachten Umstände, die auch eine potentielle Schmerzensgeldforderung berücksichtigt
</p>
<p>
Anderfalls behalte ich mir vor juristische Schritte einzuleiten und gleichzeitig auch mit meiner Situation medienwirksam an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen.
</p>
<p>
Zudem ziehe ich mein Einverständnis zur Nutzung meines Videoerfahrungsberichtes zurück und verlange eine Löschung des Videos!
</p>
<p>
Freundliche Grüsse
</p>

Dr. v.d.V en replied to this email on November 26th 2019 - again this text is in German - so please use a translator to verify my summary - which is:
<br>
Dear Mrs XXXXXXX,
</p>
<p>
For years I have been filling up the frontal sinuses with bone cement. During the initial consultation and at the day before surgery I explain this to all of my patients and that the frontal sinus will be filled up with bone cement. Your proclaimed profession is master of crafts and I had no idea that sinus resonance would be so important to you. Had I known I would have told you since the resonance can change performing a type III forehead reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
Besides the frontal sinus has no function whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
I deeply regret that your frontal sinus resonance has changed. I can&#39;t assess the consequences this will have for you. Unfortunately this procedure is irreversible. We cannot reconstruct the frontal sinus the way it was.
</p>
<p>
But you should know that your forehead couldn&#39;t have been turned into a female forehead like you have now without a type III forehead reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
I hope these facts will help you see the situation in a different light. It was necessary (the way it got done)
</p>
<p>
**********************************************************************************
</p>
<p>
Sehr geehrte Fr. XXXXXXXX
</p>
<p>
Seit Jahren schon werden die Stirnhöhlen von mir aufgefüllt mit Knochenzement.
</p>
<p>
Während der ersten Beratung UND am Tag vor der OP erkläre ich ALLE meiner Patientinnen das Prozädere und daß die Stirnhöhle mit Knochenzement aufgefüllt wird.
</p>
<p>
Als Beruf hatten Sie Handwerksmeisterin eingegeben. Deswegen war es mir nicht bekannt daß Ihre Stirnresonanz Ihnen so besonders wichtig ist. Hätte ich dies gewusst ich hätte Sie darauf aufmerksam gemacht daß die Resonanz sich ändern kann bei einem Type 3 Stirnrekontouring.
</p>
<p>
Im Übrigen hat die Stirnhöhle keine Funktion.
</p>
<p>
Es tut mir sehr Leid daß die Resonanz Ihrer Stirn sich geändert hat. Welche  Folgen daß für  Sie hat kann ich nicht einschätzen. Dies ist leider nicht umkehrbar. Wir können die Stirnhöhle nicht rekonstruieren wie sie war.
</p>
<p>
Sie sollten aber wissen daß Ihre Stirn nie so weiblich geworden wäre ohne ein Type 3 Stirnrekontouring.
</p>
<p>
Ich hoffe daß dieses Wissen Ihnen helfen wird die Änderung mit anderen Augen zu sehen. Sie war notwendig.
</p>
<p>
Liebe Grüße,
</p>
<p>
Dr Bart van de Ven

<p>
Dr. v.d. Ven totally misses the point and also admits that he filled up the sinuses - WHICH HE NOW CLAIMS HE NEVER DID.
<br>
BESIDES: It&#39;s true that a type III forehead reconstruction was necessary - but it can be done without filling the sinuses as he did - and the client never got informed about that since to her a type III was the one procedure he explained as type III on his website - which the premier league surgeons all perform - but instead he performed what is type IV on his website.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The last email that was sent to Dr. v.d. Ven/2Pass before publishing this post also included the option for a proper form of compensation/ solatium for the patient AGAIN - which was never replied to.
</p>
<p>
On 21.01.2020 I got this message into my Reddit mailbox:
</p>
<p>
********************************************************************************
</p>
<p>
Dear Mona,
</p>
<p>
In the emails we received was mentioned an actual 3D scan of the skull was made in Thailand. An X-ray is not a 3D scan indeed.
</p>
<p>
We didn‘t get a request of the patient to make a 3D scan (based on the emails we supposed she had one). The only request we have had is money or else… But we are more than happy to arrange for a 3D CT scan for our patient. Our patient coordinator is going to schedule one with her. Don‘t hesitate to contact us for information in the future so we can discuss matters like these rather than enter a war neither of us wishes to be involved in. Our door is open!
</p>
<p>
Best regards, 2pass Clinic
</p>
<p>
********************************************************************************
</p>
<p>
I asked Dr.v.d. Ven to confirm his statements by making and publishing a 3D-CT Scan which could prove what the status quo really is.
</p>
<p>
Why Dr. v.d.V en didn‘t come up with this idea himself remains his secret.
</p>
<p>
This email was sent to him on 20.01.2020:
</p>
<p>
********************************************************************************
</p>
<p>
Dear 2Pass Team, dear Dr. v.d. Ven,
</p>
<p>
I posted this message on Reddit today:
</p>
<h1>
</h1>
<p>
Since the patient and Dr. v.d. Ven were communicating from the beginning of December there was no agreement reached - that is why I published my posts.
</p>
<p>
Dr. v.d. Ven could have easily solved the situation by inviting the client to Belgium and have a 3D CT-Scan performed to clarify the situation.
</p>
<p>
Since that didn&#39;t happen our conclusions were believed to be correct.
</p>
<p>
I do hereby invite Dr. v.d. Ven to do this since a 3D-CT-Scan for his patient which will reveal what is underneath and if a type III reconstruction was actually done as he claims. Judging from the 3D X-ray image done at Kamol hospital (no 3D-CT san) this seemed quite unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Should this turn out to be true I will be ready to apologize for wrong conclusions made based on the 3D X-ray received.
</p>
<p>
But as said before - Dr. v. d. Ven could have cleared the air before all this was coming and he turned it into a competitor vs. 2Pass/v.d. Ven war - which was never the intention - and that is why most of the comments here are void - since that is not the issue.

NOTICE TO CEASE AND DESIST

<p>
We write you as the lawyers of Dr. Bart van de Ven and 2pass Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Our Ref. 00054083/17/10/10/9/SL Your Ref. Date 27 January 2020
</p>
<p>
Our clients refer (non-exhaustively) to your letter on behalf of Ms XXXXXX of 23 December 2019 as well as to the following online publications:
</p>
<p>
-

(see Annex 2).
</p>
<p>
The letter as well as the online publications, the contents of which are entirely disputed, are nothing more than a collection of deliberately false and misleading accusations and statements, damaging the good names and reputations of our clients.
</p>
<p>
Our clients have already extensively demonstrated this in their online response, the content of which should be deemed to be reiterated here (see Annex 3).
</p>
<p>
It is misleading and unacceptable that you use your position in the community to commercially aid (COMPETITOR), without giving transparency in that respect. It is all the more reprehensible that you attempt to do this by putting our clients in a bad light, based on blatantly incorrect statements that are, as you are well aware, without any merit whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
Your erroneous behaviour not only qualifies as a criminal offence (slander and defamation), but also as unfair competition and unfair trade practices.
</p>
<p>
It causes substantial damage to our clients, for which you are entirely liable.
</p>
<p>
You are hereby put on notice on behalf of our clients to immediately and permanently cease and desist from your defamatory accusations. The relevant online publications should be removed and no other such accusations are to be made public in any other way.
</p>
<p>
Non-compliance with this notice after 31 January 2020 will necessitate further legal actions.

Years ago I went for a consultation with 2pass, and I did not enjoy the experience. V.D. Ven was rude and persistent with upselling and ignoring what I actually wanted, it left me deflated for months - I chose to attend more consultations elsewhere and had a phenomenonally better experience.  From my experience and the personal testimonies of former 2pass patients I am not surprised to hear of this situation.

I have heard similar stories, but to be fair in my particular case my consultation with him went well and there was no upselling. He thought I needed cheek implants, but I did not want them (sadly, I am super ugly and no surgery can make me pass, so I wanted to go easier on the things that I think may look less natural). He said he really thought i needed them but did not insist.
</p>
<p>
Among the bad reports, I think it is fair to add that Ven has done some amazing work too, really transforming some people. I had a very difficult time choosing between him and FacialTeam but in the end I went with the latter (mostly because of how amazingly friendly the FT team is).

My friend in Germany says that Facial Team doesn&#39;t have a bone surgeon anymore and all they have is plastic surgeons. If you&#39;re worried about passing I&#39;d highly recommend going to a place where the surgeons are able to operate on bones.

Your friend is misinformed. They are qualified and do heaps of bone work with leading edge technology.

This is the official statement from Dr Bart van de Ven and his team. It is long, but we hope you will bear with us.
</p>
<p>
We want to reach out because we can’t let someone instil fear in people/patients with threats and false accusations. Patients are forever and always free to not be happy with their results and to write about their experience, but this is much more than that. This is a case of someone taking advantage of a patient in order to defame a surgeon. There is so much false information in the initial post that we feel we have to set it straight with the facts, in protection of current and future patients.
</p>
<p>
The first fact is that Mona Maier, the person representing the patient in this case, blackmailed us demanding 12,000 euros or she would slander Dr Bart van de Ven’s name online. We did not comply since we do not have anything to hide, and the claims on which the blackmail were based are false. We consulted with our own lawyers, who advised us to let them send warnings to Mona Maier. We informed her that legal action would be taken for the fact of blackmail and slander, since that is simply not okay.
</p>
<p>
But why would Mona Maier benefit from bringing this out in public? She works for FacialTeam (and other clinics and surgeons), as a liaison for German speaking people to promote their services. As you can see here:
<a href="https://www.srs-in-thailand-begleitung.com/blank-i997o" rel="nofollow">https://www.srs-in-thailand-begleitung.com/blank-i997o
</a>
, for example. A blog post in which she defames 2pass Clinic to then promote FacialTeam, who seem to have people working for them everywhere to seemingly influence patients who are in a very fragile position.
</p>
<p>
Let’s tackle the most important things now:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
1. The patient did indeed get a Type III forehead reconstruction done, not a Type IV
</strong>
. The proposal of the patient clearly mentions they can always use bone cement during the type III procedure (this cannot be overlooked by the patient, since the patient is obliged to read everything before she would be able to agree, sign an informed consent, and go through with the surgery). This is mentioned on the proposal the patient received after her initial consultation.
</p>
<p>
Type IV surgery means they use some more cement (as addition to the Type III) to fill the dent that is present in such patients. This patient did not have this, it was 100% a type III.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, there is an entire paragraph dedicated to mentioning bone cement on the webpage Mona Maier links to, which would be quite hard to miss since it is the first thing that is mentioned when you read about the Type 3:
</p>
<p>
“Type 3 brow bone reduction—Forehead reconstruction =&gt;
</p>
<p>
The forehead recontouring procedure we perform the most (since it is indicated most) is called the ‘type III’ procedure by Dr Ousterhout. During this procedure, the anterior wall of the frontal sinus bone is removed, remodelled and put back. Sometimes it is necessary to use a combination of forehead reconstruction and some filling with bone cement to get the desired forehead shape. Dr Bart van de Ven uses the bone cement more and more often to get the exact result he wants.” Much like Mona advises, please do go and take a look at the website so you can read it yourself
<a href="https://2pass.clinic/en/ffs/procedures/brow-bone-reduction" rel="nofollow">https://2pass.clinic/en/ffs/procedures/brow-bone-reduction
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Dr Bart van de Ven always explains how the surgery will be performed, and with which materials, on the consultation as well as going into even further detail the day before the operation. All patients always know exactly what is going to happen before entering the OR.
</p>
<p>
The patient got very beautiful and naturally feminine results, she had her pictures and testimonial online on our website with amazing reactions for months until now. She chose to agree to have them online because she was so happy. In October she was even requesting a second procedure (facelift) because she was so satisfied with our services. You can see for yourself and hear tell how happy she is in the 4 months postop video:
<a href="https://2pass.clinic/en/before-and-after/detail/8" rel="nofollow">https://2pass.clinic/en/before-and-after/detail/8
</a>
. It is only after she met Mona Maier in Thailand, who works for Facial Team, the blackmailing began. The forehead reconstruction type III she had is the one all patients of Dr van de Ven have had since a few years with good results. There are no patients that now have a “dysphunctional sinus”, and no health problems regarding sinuses can stem from this type of surgery.
</p>
<p>
The frontal sinus in women is generally smaller than the one in men, reducing the sinus does not have any negative effect on the physique of a patient whatsoever. Do not worry, do not let Mona Maier’s message scare you, because that’s the intention. It was sadly not written in the interest of the trans community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
2. Dr Bart van de Ven is a registered Maxillofacial surgeon.
</strong>
If people are wary, we will gladly show you Dr Bart van de Ven’s diplomas and/or refer you to the places he has obtained them. This is a very unfortunate, and even more so, a very imprudent accusation.
</p>
<p>
Even more imprudent seeing as Facial Team actually does have a surgeon (Dr Simon) who is only allowed to work as a dentist in Europe. He has only obtained a diploma as a dentist and after oral surgery in Brazil. He is not a medical doctor, he has not ever obtained any medical diploma, let alone one as a maxillofacial surgeon. He can only perform oral surgery in Brazil, but definitely no FFS anywhere. As their own website mentions, the only degree he obtained in Europe is one in dentistry. He did not obtain any certificate from his presence at the Department of Oral and Craniomaxillofacial Surgery of the Eeuwfeestkliniek in Antwerp and has not performed surgeries there either, because it would have been illegal.
</p>
<p>
That the Royal Belgian Society of Plastic Surgeons (RBSPS) doesn‘t have a member/ registration by the name of Dr. van de Ven is very logic: Dr Bart van de Ven is not a plastic surgeon, but a maxillofacial surgeon. He is a member of the professional association of maxillofacial surgeons in Belgium. In our opinion maxillofacial surgeons are to be preferred over plastic surgeons for FFS, as work on the bone level is at the core of it.
</p>
<p>
Dr Ellen Defrancq has studied general medicine, but has never studied to become a surgeon nor practised that, let alone that she’d be a plastic surgeon. She is simply the manager of the clinic, as mentioned on our website. But what that has to do with the case is not clear to us.
</p>

You are claiming here that you haven&#39;t done what you wrote in an eMail sent to Mona.
</p>
<p>
She cited this mail by you: &#34;For years I have been filling up the frontal sinuses with bone cement. During the initial consultation and at the day before surgery I explain this to all of my patients and that the frontal sinus will be filled up with bone cement. Your proclaimed profession is master of crafts and I had no idea that sinus resonance would be so important to you. Had I known I would have told you since the resonance can change performing a type III forehead reconstruction.&#34;
</p>
<p>
In the above comment you wrote: &#34;The proposal of the patient clearly mentions they can always use bone cement during the type III procedure&#34;
</p>
<p>
Well, isn&#39;t there a HUGE difference between using bone cement at all and filling up the whole frontal sinus?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know exactly what this sinus&#39; functions are. But you simply filled the whole sinus without letting your patients know? OH MY GOSH that&#39;s honestly... unacceptable. In your type III reconstruction you claim that you&#39;d use some bone cement, as stated on your website: &#34;During this procedure, the anterior wall of the frontal sinus bone is removed, remodelled and put back.&#34;.
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t write on the website, that you fill up the whole frontal sinus. And as far as I can tell this, there seems to be a huge difference between having a frontal sinus or not having one.
</p>
<p>
If you really have filled up the whole sinus, then you&#39;d probably not win any lawsuit. Actually I suppose the opposite. This could became very expensive for the 2 Pass clinic!

I had Type 3 done by him and he did use bone cement. But he did specify that he wouldn&#39;t fill the nasal cavity and that he just uses the bone cement to even out some portions of the surface of the forehead.
</p>
<p>
I am super happy with my results but I might have to get a scan now to see for sure 😕

To be fair, Deschamps-Braly doesn&#39;t do scans post-surgery, only pre-surgery. Cause like, what is a surgeon gonna
<em>
do
</em>
with that post-surgical scan, you&#39;re not going to make any decisions based on it, the surgery is already Done. imho they should only do a scan if something has gone wrong enough that they&#39;re considering further surgery

The surgeon is going to use it to verify the results, describe it to the patient, and add it to the patient’s file for future reference. It is standard procedure for Dr. Mardirossian. I appreciated it so much to better understand my body and exactly what was done to it.

But again, here&#39;s my point - what is the doctor gonna do once they &#34;verify the results&#34;; are they gonna re-operate? If the answer is always &#34;no&#34; or &#34;let&#39;s wait and see for the result&#34;, then you don&#39;t need the scan in the first place.
</p>
<p>
And tbh any doctor who saw a scan and said, &#34;I&#39;m not sure if this will cause you any actual issues, but I want to re-operate, right after I just operated on you&#34; would give me some pretty serious concerns

If I’m honest, I wouldn’t recommend a surgeon based off my experience. I went out and tried to get as many in person reviews as I could as I don’t really trust what’s online. Meeting people in person is what sealed it for me but again, my experience was mine, I’m not going to recommend someone a surgeon when I have no idea if it’ll work for them.

I am meeting with him next month though and will be bringing the sinus thing up, as if true, it’s genuinely awful!

Not really — the clinic does not use fake accounts. They do however suggest patients to leave an honest review online (regardless of content) to get a small discount.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s not necessarily an issue, but obviously patients in such situations may feel the need to show loyalty.

Source: lots of irl friends who went there, and are happy with results.

To me, that actually speaks to how euphoric the experience was for someone. When you&#39;re having a great time (despite, you know, having your face re-assembled) every positive experience becomes sweeter still.

Do NOT go to him he botched me. I&#39;m his latest victim please be careful who you entrust your face. You only have one given to you by your parents and nature and you don&#39;t want a lazy surgeon who only sees patients as bags of money and not really care about your well being and satisfaction or safety. He is high risks despite the photoshopped pics he has on his site and the paid reviews on YouTube. If you are not a YouTuber, Belgian or if you go alone he&#39;ll do a half arsed job on your face.

Wow I’m disappointed. After reading every comment on this page including the response from 2pass, plus additional reviews elsewhere, I’ve decided not to go to their clinic to have my FFS...
