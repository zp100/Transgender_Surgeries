I am curious about the visitor policy at both the hospital and l&#39;Ascepiade.  Like you, I will have someone accompanying me to Montreal, and I know they would like to be by my side for as much of the journey as possible.

My wife accompanied me in early February.
</p>
<p>
At the clinic (2 night stay) your support person can be in the room with you from 9am-8am. There is a chair there. I believe it is only one person per patient.
</p>
<p>
At the convalescent home (6 night stay full depth, 4 night zero depth) you are allowed one person to be in your room, otherwise up to 3 visitors in the common area. Visiting hours from 2pm-8pm. This is mainly because a lot more things are happening in the mornings with dressing being removed etc, so it’s easier to not have visitors around.
</p>
<p>
My wife was with me for basically all hours she could, and the nurses don’t have a problem with this :)
</p>
<p>
In the convalescent home I used the time before she could come to talk with others in the common area. Not everyone wants to leave their room or are doing well enough to do so, but it was very nice for me.

We luckily have friends who live in Montreal, so she stayed with them.  Otherwise I believe you can get preferred rates on extra nights at the Holiday Inn in Laval where you will be for 2 nights before anyways. GRS books that hotel for 2 nights, your wife should be able to extend it and pay the extra cost.  Hotels in Montreal itself are very expensive ($200+ per night).

Thank you for this detailed write up.  I was at GRS early February and this was my experience too (minus the COVID part).
</p>
<p>
Thank you as well for the part about zero/minimal depth. I think people need to hear more that it is okay to go with that option. I myself chose minimal depth because I knew I couldn’t commit to the recovery, and I didn’t have any desire to be penetrated.
</p>
<p>
I hope your recovery goes smoothly from here and GRS respond soon with a constructive way forward for you :)

Thank you so much for posting this! I&#39;ve got my surgery in a little less than 2 weeks and I&#39;ve been so nervous for it. Your post really puts me at ease, hearing about the great care you got at the clinic!

This has been such a helpful and reassuring read! You answered a lot of questions about some smaller (but very important) details not outlined in the information packets.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m booked for late August for zero-depth, and I&#39;ve been so worried that a positive COVID-19 test would mean having to turn around and fly home with no surgery - it was pretty strongly implied in the information I was given, so I&#39;m glad they just apply droplet-contact precautions like any other hospital. Big relief!
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for sharing! I wish you all the best with your recovery.

Yikes. Thank you for sharing, I haven&#39;t had my consultation yet and still a month to go before surgery. I&#39;ve been wearing masks to be extra cautious, so this just cements my resolve.
</p>
<p>
I do understand why they reserve to the right to reschedule, but given that PCRs can, in some cases, read positive for upwards of 90 days following infection, it feels unfair. If someone is symptomatic? Yes, I get that... but as a health care provider who has been at the mercy of this pandemic and its restrictions for years, I&#39;ll be devastated if COVID-19 throws yet another wrench into things.
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed! Maybe I ought to see about yet another booster...

Absolutely, everyone at work is asking me if I&#39;m sick, and I have to keep explaining that I&#39;m simply trying to avoid getting sick!
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we will cross paths! August 23rd is my surgery date, fates willing. :)

Thank you so much for your write up! I have surgery at GRS sometime in the next 3-5 months and am very excited, but also starting to get a bit nervous. I have two questions if you have time:
</p>
<p>
1) Is there anything about the dilation process that made it so daunting for you? I’m going to be on short term disability from work for 3 months and living with my mom instead of at home. I sort of figured it would be manageable, like a 6-8 hour a day job. But it seems like it’s maybe harder than I anticipated. I do want full depth, even though I’m gay I think being penetrated sounds awesome 🤭
</p>
<p>
2) Do you know why they don’t form any labia minora?

Some surgeons do, some don’t. There’s differences in skill, and there’s only so much you can do when you performs surgery that fast.

What do you mean about withdrawals? From HRT, or from painkillers? I might try CBD to help with the painkiller withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
Well, the no labia minora thing is a bit upsetting since they do state in their pre-op package that they do form labia minora. I’m quite a bold little shit, might just tell my surgeon the day of that I would very much like them to try. I’ve seen some Brassard post-op results where it looks like he actually bothered to create labia minora.
