Here are my 2 month pictures following my 1st stage Combined Method vaginoplasty with Dr Schaff.  Since last month, the swelling has come down a lot. There&#39;s still a bit and I think at 2 months that should be expected!  Numbness is subsiding, there&#39;s still a little bit but again far less than last month. Sensation is now more defined, it&#39;s like the nerves have a better resolution than before.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure that dilating is much easier than it was a month ago.  Depth is the same, the only downside of sensation returning and swelling going down is that it&#39;s more obvious to me where there there&#39;s scarring, I&#39;m aware of some around the bottom of the opening, and where there is a join in the vaginal cavity.  I was told I could maybe go down to 2 dilations a day from now, but I&#39;m not happy to do that just yet and will continue with three times a day for a little while yet - I&#39;ve found that if I do drop to 2 it&#39;s more difficult to start the dilation off.  I&#39;ve dropped the afternoon-to-evening placeholder that I use between dilations, but still use the overnight and morning-to-afternoon ones.
</p>

My month 1 photos are here:

I went into this a bit in the month 1 thread, it&#39;s not ppt or sigmoid colon, it&#39;s a development of the PI method where they use scrotal tissue at the top of the canal and urethral lining along the front and top, for lubrication.. It&#39;s similar to Suporn/Bank and Chett&#39;s work in Thailand but there are some differences. This is a 2 stage op as well, so I have more surgery to come in September. That way, the surgeon can put less tension on everything making healing easier, in theory!
</p>
<p>
Edit: added what the urethral lining is used for

That detail is different, yes.  The way they construct the clitoris is more in line with a cis one, it is a Y shape going down from the top and inside a bit.  What&#39;s created retains pretty much all the sensate tissue, but without separating it into a separate &#39;Chonburi organ&#39;.
</p>
<p>
With the scrotal skin used inside the canal, I believe it&#39;s processed differently but used in the same place - at the top, rather than at the back of the canal.

Schaff&#39;s is more cis-like but both use as much material as they can, many others will discard some potentially sensate material.

Do you know if this is also the method that Morath and Schöll use?

Wow! This is the surgery that terrifies me the most but honestly that looks astounding! I would’ve never believed that type of realism. I understand this must be very vulnerable to post such pictures but I must say how appreciative I am that you were willing to do that for us others. If medical procedures can accomplish something like that the. that gives me a great boost of confidence that maybe one day I can truly be me. HrT first but baby steps to where you are at.

Much love and thanks making the impossible seem possible ❤️❤️

Hey, do you know and would be willing to share how much time you spend dilating? I recently read in a report by a Suporn patient (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fayd3p/srs_with_dr_suporn_pdf_5th_edition/" rel="nofollow">SRS with Dr Suporn PDF 5th Edition</a>
) that at month 1, she was dilating for 1h 3x per day, then dropping to 2x at month 3, 1x at month 7 and below after month 12. This seems like a lot and is rather off-putting. Is this the same for the combined method or do you require less dilation? Thank you and btw. you look great.

Of course!  I currently dilate 3x per day (usually), for 20-30 minutes at a time.  Occasionally longer if I&#39;m not in a hurry and I get carried away reading something on my phone or listening to music.  I could optionally drop down to twice a day for the same session time now, but I&#39;m going to keep doing 3 a day for a week or so longer.  At 3 months I can drop down to once or twice a week (or have regular penetrative sex) as long as I&#39;m happy with my progress.
</p>
<p>
I normally insert, and move and reinsert every 5 minutes or so.  Dr Schaff&#39;s dilators are different to most, they&#39;re not hard plastic but are made of stiff foam, so they have a bit of give in them, which makes it easier to insert and get around the pubic bone for the last few inches - my depth&#39;s about 7&#34;/18cm, I use the largest 2 that were supplied, the first (3cm/1.2&#34; for about 5 minutes, and the larger (3.7cm/1.4&#34; diameter) the rest of the time.

I have these dilators and they measure approximately 3.1/3.6/4.1cm. What&#39;s your smallest size?
</p>
<p>
Also from week 8 I can reduce to 2 times a day over the next weeks. No speak of reducing to 1 or 2 times a week after 3 months.  This is the information from his &#34;aftercare guide&#34;.

I saw my roommate&#39;s ones that she got a while ago, these were slightly larger than mine as well and if I were guessing, I&#39;d say they were the same size as yours.  I&#39;m now wondering if Merzendorfer sent the correct set, or Dr Schaff has recently reduced the specification? My smallest one is 2.7cm/1.05&#34; diameter, they sent them to me in January.
</p>
<p>
The 3 month reduction to 1-2x a week was from talking to the other doctors in the hospital, and Dr Schaff over email, it can be worked out from the instructions but I only received these a few weeks ago by email, and I had to translate myself:  3x/day for 6-8 weeks, then twice a day for a few weeks (taking it to 10-12 weeks / 3 months approx) and lifelong bougienage/dilation 1-2x/week thereafter.

I thought the full translation might be useful - I&#39;ve Google Translated it and then paraphrased it where it didn&#39;t quite make sense.  Some of it still might not, it&#39;s a bit rough!
</p>
<p>
For the hormone (estriol) cream part, I had Estriol Wolff in Germany and Ovestin in the UK, and also use Sylk lubricant, as that&#39;s what I can get on prescription). Estriol Wolff was a much better cream for me as even though I needed more of it, it absorbed better.

Bougier (dilation) instructions after Gender Confirmation Surgery with combined method
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
After discharge from inpatient treatment, a bougienage of the neovagina must be carried out. This is a suggested plan that each patient can of course vary slightly, so the precise duration of each bougienage session is not of critical importance. The schedule is recommended according to the plan, but can also be varied.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
The aim of dilation is pressure treatment of the scars in the vaginal area, local treatment of the wounds and training of the pelvic floor muscles. A regular check-up by a gynecologist should be arranged.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
For 6-8 weeks this should be done according to following plan:
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
Insert the smallest bougie (dilator) three times a day (covered with a fresh medical condom and smeared with Iruxol and Furacin ointment on the tip). Smear the ointment and slowly introduce. Put on a sanitary napkin and tight girdles.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
After 8 hours, remove the placeholder, rinse with water and start the next session. If the smallest bougie can be inserted very easily, it is possible to use the next larger one, and so on.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
In the case of irritation-free wound healing, the ointments should be quickly replaced by female hormone cream and fatty cream (attention - Furacin and Iruxol can trigger a local reaction after prolonged use!). The placeholder for the night should then be coated with hormone cream (Ovesti / Ökolp). If in doubt, ask a gynecologist!
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
In the next few weeks, bougienage can be reduced to twice a day (with or without wearing a placeholder).
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
Consultation with the surgeon after approx. 3 - 4 months. Then you can already see whether and what should be corrected with a 2nd GA.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
Lifelong bougienage e.g. once or twice a week (or regular sexual intercourse) should be carried out.
</em>

How much time per day do you need to invest into aftercare of the surgery by now? Is working after 2 months a realistic expectation or should one rest more? Got surgery with schaff in october and kinda wanna start working afterwards (fresh graduated from college)

I&#39;ve just started my second full-time week back at work, I did a few hours a week before that. I work in an office, but I&#39;m working from home a 2 days a week at the moment and the rest in the office. Last week I needed the doughnut cushion, this week I don&#39;t. I&#39;m getting exercise - I&#39;ve been scooting instead of cycling though! I did nothing but eat and very little exercise after the surgery so I&#39;ve put a few Kg on...

Aftercare isn&#39;t too bad, each session typically takes me 30 minutes, and depending on my day, I&#39;ll do 2 or 3, if I&#39;m only doing 2 they will be the start and end of the day so the rest of the day you&#39;re not really thinking about it.
