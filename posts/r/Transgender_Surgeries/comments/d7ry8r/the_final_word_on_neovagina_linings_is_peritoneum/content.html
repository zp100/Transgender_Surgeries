<strong>
TL;DR:
</strong>
The lining of a neovagina
<strong>
<em>
does
</em>
</strong>
change and adapt to it&#39;s environment and the type of lining that you have dictates how much adaption happens and how quickly. With a &#39;full-thickness&#39; skin graft it will adapt to
<em>
resemble
</em>
mucosa. With split-thickness it is possible for the graft to completely change into mucosa, but not always. With peritoneal it is a certainty. So in summary the difference between peritoneum and a normal skin graft is really how quickly it adapts to the environment, but some adaption will always happen.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
As some of you may have noticed from all posts I&#39;ve made lately I&#39;ve made it my mission to understand the science of SRS, in particular the always hot topic of the neovagina lining. There is a lot of confusing information out there and I know many of us have a mental picture of a literally skin lined neovagina which is not mucosal and therefore in our minds not optimal. That&#39;s why so many of us are so interested in the &#39;new&#39; peritoneal pull through procedure, which in theory at least is supposed to create a mucosal internal lining rather than a &#39;skin&#39; lining of standard techniques.
</p>
<p>
But there&#39;s a lot about this picture that doesn&#39;t add up. For example -  peritoneal pull through is
<em>
not
</em>
in fact new at all and has been around for many years... but if that&#39;s the case and if it so clearly better than a skin-lined neovagina why don&#39;t world leading surgeons like Chett and Suporn offer it? Also why do the surgeons who do offer it only do so as a back up option when there isn&#39;t enough existing material? Similarly why does everyone (at least every anecdotal story and pic I&#39;ve ever come across) report that the inside of their neovagina &#39;feels like the inside of their cheek&#39;?
</p>
<p>
To try and understand what&#39;s going on I taught myself a bit about the science of skin grafting. I read a medical book for students on grafting techniques, I learned about oral skin grafts (a more common surgery which faces a similar problem) and I read up on MRKH syndrome, which is when someone is born with a vulva but no internal vagina.
</p>
<p>
To cut straight to the point, I learned that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
There are different types of skin graft, including &#39;split-thickness&#39; and &#39;full-thickness&#39;. The latter includes all the layers of the skin whereas the former only includes the top most layers.
</li>
<li>
&#34;It is the underlying stroma  that influences the phenotype of the overlying epithelium.&#34; In other words it is the deeper skin layers that decide what &#39;type&#39; of skin the outer most layer is. [1]
</li>
<li>
In the context of full-thickness skin grafts: &#34;Although it is genetically impossible for skin to change into mucosa, it is possible for the skin to resemble the mucosa very closely. We believe that the skin comes to resemble the mucosa through an initial inflammatory change, followed by regressive changes of the skin-specific appendages.
<strong>
Under the influence of saliva and other environmental factors, the skin can adapt considerably to the oral environment
</strong>
.&#34; So, it is possible for a full-thickness graft to adapt to the environment and resemble the mucosa very closely.  [2]
</li>
<li>
But what about split-thickness, since that doesn&#39;t include all the lower layers? Split-thickness is also the type of graft used for non-penile inversion and for MRKH procedures. It turns out that the adaption is even more significant: &#34;As a result of the adaptation process, the split-thickness skin graft acquires both histological and physiological characteristics of normal vaginal mucosa. Also, neovaginal epithelium was evaluated to be macroscopically similar to normal vaginal mucosa at the 12th month after the operation.&#34; [3] &amp; [4]
</li>
<li>
I also found multiple reports of normal microbial flora in the neovaginas of transgender women, which would not be possible without some kind of adoption happening: &#34;In this study we report the frequent occurrence of lactobacilli from neovagina of transsexual women. Both, frequency and composition were similar to the normal lactic acid bacterial microflora in both women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women.&#34; [5,6,7]
</li>
<li>
And finally I found direct reports of the metaplasia (i.e. transformation) of peritoneum lined and colon-sigmoid lined neovaginas into normal vaginal mucosa. [8,9]
</li>
</ul>

This sounds very nice, but I think people might draw conclusions that aren&#39;t supported by the actual sources. You are right when you say that any graft will adapt
<em>
somewhat
</em>
, but the cited sources stipulate strong limits for skin grafts in neovaginas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Your bolded quote about skin adapting to the oral environment has nothing to do with GCS...different skin, environment, surgery, etc. than GCS. It sounds nice because it sounds suggestive but doesn&#39;t actually mean anything for GCS. This applies to your first two bullet points &amp; sources.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Your third source says &#34;skin grafts used for mucosa replacement become adapted with some alterations in their characteristics
<em>
but they do not undergo a complete metaplasia to become mucosa, but a pseudomucosal metaplasia that makes the wall’s consistency as similar as possible to a real vaginal mucous membrane, since the skin is too highly differentiated
</em>
&#34;.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I can&#39;t see more than the abstract of the fourth paper, so I can&#39;t say anything about that. It doesn&#39;t claim anything interesting anyways.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Your fifth source actually says &#34;The transsexual neovagina is a skin-lined cavity without mucosa...&#34; and such things throughout their paper.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Your sixth source says, in the conclusion: &#34;The penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women can reflect the cytological findings present in biological women.
<em>
However &#39;normal&#39; cervical cytology, with superficial, intermediate and parabasal cells as well as Döderlein bacilli, was found in only 4% of transsexual women.
</em>
&#34;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Your seventh source says, in the conclusion: &#34;Cytological findings of the neovagina resemble normal cervical cytology with superficial, intermediate and parabasal cells as well as Döderlein bacilli in a minority of cases.&#34;. (specifically 10%, or 2/20 cases)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also note that there is way too little research on peritoneal grafts to actually say anything conclusive about the outcome.
</p>
<p>
Also these studies are
<em>
teeny
</em>
, and there&#39;s so little replication/clarification! Most papers didn&#39;t even specify the specific surgeries/grafts that were used.
</p>
<p>
Overall I think these sources support the possibility of proper microflora in standard penile-inversion GCS, McIndoe vaginoplasty, and maybe suporn-style GCS. These sources also say that there are hard limits to skin graphs for GCS. I&#39;m guessing &#34;the final word&#34; was deliberate hyperbole to have a nice title, but this is hardly conclusive.
</p>
<p>
Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong on any of this!
</p>
<p>
EDIT: To address the question &#34;why don&#39;t Chett/Suporn offer it&#34;:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Peritoneal methods require laparoscopy, which requires training (which they don&#39;t have) and equipment. GCS surgeons almost always don&#39;t have the background to perform this stuff.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It also makes things more expensive (equipment, training/people, time). Most people who go to the Thai surgeons pay the surgery themselves, so the price is important.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They don&#39;t have sufficient motivation to change anything. They&#39;re swamped with customers, scheduling many years out. They have no need to change methods unless their business is going elsewhere.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There isn&#39;t enough data on peritoneal techniques - anyone who gets it is a guinea pig. I don&#39;t see why Suporn/Chett would risk it when they have such extensive experience &amp; proficiency with their methods.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The erotic nerves from genital grafts could well be considered a fair trade-off for the lack of mucosa. Trans women getting PI/Thai-style get even
<em>
more
</em>
erotic sensation than cis women get in the vaginal canal. It&#39;s very affirming and fun to be so sensate there, even if it&#39;s not actually biologically accurate.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

Great job going through the studies! I was planning on doing the same but then I saw you already had. For the fourth study,
<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00004347-198805000-00008">here&#39;s a link to the full text.

</p>
<p>
Edit: Just looking through it now, but none of the participants studied were transgender. 18 had Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome and 3 had complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. In any case, in their results, they had 8 people with skin-like, 3 with vaginal-like, 3 with combined, and 7 with mixed epithelium. They speculate that the results may be explained by how much of the stroma was transplanted along with the epithelium.

Your welcome :). Please go through them too! I&#39;d like at least one other person to read through them to (not) replicate my findings. I very well could have missed stuff, misrepresented quotes/papers, or misunderstood the authors.

Oh wow! Very interesting, and I think it supports my analysis of the sources. I&#39;ll read it more and maybe edit the original comment to add stuff from this paper.

Your comment of sensation with the penile skin graft is new to me. My understand is that with any skin graft, sensation is lost since any never are severed.

Hello! I&#39;ve been actually trying to find information about how do they keep sensation inside the neovaginal cavity? Everytime I read a paper about penile inversion vaginoplasty they always mention how do they keep the nerves in the neoclitoris but not actually inside the cavity, so can you explain to me how do they make it possible and  give me some sources (if you have them)? Thank you!!!

Agree about your criticisms for the most part. But its also not entirely the case w.r.t. peritoneal.
</p>
<p>
We actually do have very strong evidence supporting metaplasia in these types of procedures. Mostly because we arent forced to using only postop trans women as the cohort.

<p>
Yep, we don&#39;t have the data to discuss peritoneal results anyways. All we have is a couple papers talking about a handful of MKRH women. Peritoneal methods
<em>
could
</em>
be a concrete improvement towards biologically accurate vaginal canals in neovaginas - and that&#39;s what the little research has shown - but there hasn&#39;t even been a single paper about transwomen &amp; peritoneal techniques yet.
</p>
<p>
Also, I don&#39;t think biological accuracy is what&#39;s important. Why not trade mucosa for more erotic sensation? The additional small amount of upkeep is probably worth the less fragility and the large increase in sexual pleasure.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Are there sources besides the ones given in OP you&#39;re talking about? Because OP&#39;s sources said that metaplasia
<em>
didn&#39;t
</em>
happen, or happened rarely (see my original comment). I see no consensus that skin grafts undergo metaplasia in neovaginas, whether one is cis or trans. Actually the consensus seems to be (from OP&#39;s sources) that metaplasia
<em>
doesn&#39;t
</em>
happen to skin grafts in neovaginas.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I&#39;m not sure that we can assume vaginoplasty results for cis women apply to trans women. There are things that are
<em>
suggestive
</em>
of this but definitely not conclusive, especially since most trans women use skin grafts that aren&#39;t available to cis women (penis/scrotum).

Different people have different priorities and goals. For me, biological accuracy is
<em>
the
</em>
absolute most important factor. I couldn&#39;t care less about increased sexual sensitivity. In fact, I&#39;ve been looking into ways that I can eliminate this extra sensitivity myself if I do end up going to Suporn because I don&#39;t want it at all.

<p>
Yeah, that&#39;s 100% understandable. I should&#39;ve been more clear - I meant that alot of people say they want &#34;biological accuracy&#34; when they&#39;d really be happier with a less biologically-accurate vagina if it gives them better things.  Kind of like how many cis women take BC/IUDs to stop shark week...less biological accuracy but more niceness.

I&#39;m not sure why youre narrowing in on cervical cytology as the central thing here the cervix is at the end of the vaginal canal rather than the thing itself and so it makes sense that a lot of the enviornmental cues encouraging metaplastic transdifferentiation into cervical tissue specifically would be absent but thats more of a side note to the question of whether cell identity changes to match/resemble vaginal mucosa.

So...
<em>
is

peritoneum better than a skin graft or penile inversion, then?

Not really! It just means you don’t have to wait 12 months for the skin to adapt, but the end result is virtually the same as a split-thickness graft.

<p>
Which papers mentioned self-cleaning capabilities? Must have missed that.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re equating &#34;self-cleaning&#34; with &#34;proper mucosa&#34;, I&#39;d agree with you. I&#39;m pretty sure self-cleaning functionality does actually come from the mucosal properties in the vaginal canal but I could be wrong.

Ah okay, I thought you were referencing OP&#39;s sources because you said &#34;

it seems to be the only way to guarantee that your vagina is ... ensure proper pH and self cleaning function&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I 100% agree with your analysis otherwise.
</p>
<p>
A semi-aside, but your surgery is super cool! I think your technique (peritoneal tissue from the scrotum) is brilliant as long as you have enough donor tissue for labia &amp; such.

I apologize for ambiguous wording! I was both referring to OPs studies showing what percentage of women achieved mucosa/appropriate bacterial flora and my prior knowledge regarding what makes a vagina self cleaning.
</p>
<p>
Thank you! And I agree I think it achieves the best possible results with modern technology if you have adequate donor material available. It&#39;s a big reason I chose the program at Sinai, and it&#39;s also why they don&#39;t do abdominal peritoneal grafts unless you&#39;re lacking depth otherwise
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with the results so far. The only complication I&#39;ve had is granulation which seems better than a coin toss that one will get some during recovery.
</p>
<p>
Smooth sailing otherwise, and getting better each day.

I do actually :). Can the non-peritoneal scrotal tissue still be used for the vulva, or can only the penile tissue be used?
</p>
<p>
If not, I don&#39;t get why abdominal grafts aren&#39;t preferred? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard of &#34;too much&#34; labial tissue in GCS, and if scrotal/abdominal peritoneum are the same, I&#39;d assume the risks of laparoscopy are worth the extra labial tissue for most people.

If you watch the video on my profile you can actually see how they do it! They basically cut out a section of the scrotum that will be used for the graft and the rest is left to form the labia. It will be less than with methods that don&#39;t rely on a scrotal graft of course. But there will be tissue left for that purpose.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still very swollen so the details are a bit obscured but I do have defined labia.
</p>
<p>
So the reasons are three fold. First, the secondary surgery required to harvest the abdominal peritoneum requires additional specialisation, additional time, and additional anesthesia. At Mt. Sinai their doctors are not trained in the labroscopic machine so it requires a second surgical team to come in and harvest the graft then change over to the primary team.
</p>
<p>
This all increases risk and medicine does seek to limit risks.
</p>
<p>
The second is that abdominal peritoneum is more fragile and less stretchy than scrotal skin, both of which are concerns for people who enjoy penetrative sex but also just for dilation it&#39;s a bit easier and you&#39;re less likely to cause yourself issues.
</p>
<p>
The third is that the abdominal peritoneum is effectively null regarding nervous sensation, whereas a scrotal graft is erogenously sensate.
</p>
<p>
And the kind of bonus reason that I&#39;m sure factors in is that the use of a scrotal graft is well tested and understood whereas abdominal peritoneum is less tested in trans women. So it is safer/easier for them to go that route.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure the science will continue to improve. I&#39;m sure in 10 years the technology will far exceed what I have access to. But I committed to getting the procedure as soon as I could afford it rather than waiting  for next year&#39;s model because I had intense genital dysphoria for my entire life.
</p>
<p>
It took me ten years to save up which allowed me to access this advanced surgery so that&#39;s a kind of benefit though still I would have preferred being able to get it done ten years ago. But a great benefit is that my insurance changed this year and actually covered it so I just had to pay up to my out of pocket max rather than empty my life savings.

Oh wow! There&#39;s erotic sensation in the scrotal peritoneum? That&#39;s fantastic!
</p>
<p>
Yeah your surgery definitely sounds like the future! Peritoneum + erotic sensation is probably the perfect combo for almost everyone.
</p>
<p>
Congrats on achieving such a milestone! I agree, we can&#39;t stop moving forward just because we are afraid there might be something better around the corner.

Which doc did you use btw? This sounds vastly superior to pmuch every other SRS technique out there. (Also I’m wondering if it can be combined with penis-sparing vaginoplasty, because uhhhh I like my dick.)

But if you want to keep that part you&#39;re going to need more donor material from somewhere. I also don&#39;t think anyone at Sinai does that particular procedure

Apparently, the skin inside the mouth is the same type of skin found in a vagina (and a few other places that aren&#39;t relevant), so I guess that&#39;s a good thing/normal/ideal?

&#34;Non-keratinized surfaces must be kept moist by bodily secretions to prevent them from drying out.

Examples of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium include corneal epithelium, lining mucosa of oral cavity, ... vagina, ...&#34;

Well you left out that the incidences of keratinization occurs very often in penile inversion and scrotal flap techniques although I strongly suspect that it is correlated to their hrt regiment and treatment. This is my stance and it will not change. You&#39;ll notice many who are on a proper hrt regimen, are actually very satisfied with their results following scrotal/penile inversion technique.
</p>
<p>
The peritoneal technique is indeed more adaptable.
</p>
<p>
I had the peritoneal technique as well as the scrotal/penile inversion during the same procedure. It definitely changes in accordinance to my exogenous hormone levels. I can prove this if I could be a lab rat but I am very satisifed with the results and I encourage those who undergo the operation to be on a proper hrt treatment plan.
