My wife had SRS in early December, packing was out around a week ago. Her surgeon gave her very little direction/ support in terms of Post-Op care (eg. Her surgeon didn&#39;t even mention that dilating is supposed to be at least 10 mins, for the first few days she was doing a minute at most) and I&#39;m trying to step up.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s already on the third dilator. None of her dilators have any notches or &#34;dots&#34;. But one thing is that after dilation, the dilator itself smells HORRIFIC.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t smell like a sweaty vagina, or even sweaty dick/balls. It doesn&#39;t smell like feces, but like a weird, sharp smell that almost reminds me of vomit or spoiled food. The smell doesn&#39;t go away with warm water/soap, and we even tried leaving it in boiled water for ten mins, and the smell is fainter but still present.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a silicone dilator if that helps.
</p>
<p>
Since she got very little input from her surgeon, I&#39;m wondering if this is normal, what I can do to help her, if she needs to douche or if there&#39;s some cream or something I should be helping her put on down there. I&#39;m really not sure if this is just normal wound healing, or potentially a sign of some kind of complications.

idk maybe grab soulsource dilators instead. Something like 4x/day with surgilube. They might smell better since its hard plastic and the lube is, well, for medical things like this.
</p>
<p>
A shocking amount of these surgeons do the surgery itself and then just do jack shit for aftercare. Aftercare is the most important fucking part. It&#39;s infuriating. I&#39;ve heard of doctors who just ram the orange dilator in when the packing comes out. They&#39;re absolutely ignorant about dilation.
</p>
<p>
A pt should not be going into this surgery, let alone coming out of it, not knowing how to dilate. You should know
<em>
months
</em>
in advance what it entails.

I&#39;ve seen a few recommendations for those across this subreddit, definitely going to be spending a lot of my free time for the next few weeks doing some research and asking questions.
</p>
<p>
This particular surgeon has been a nightmare to deal with. Repeatedly forgot to prescribe things, put the wrong discharge date on her papers, often forgot to meet with her before leaving at the end of his shift... His skills seem good from what little knowledge I have but the bedside manner and aftercare? Woof.

Surgeon is Dr Opoku, trained under a guy called Sherman Leis. Operates in Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
His actual &#34;knife work&#34; seems good from what I can tell, but he seems REALLY scatterbrained. From what I understand, my wife&#39;s main other option was Dr Rumer, who seems to have a terrible reputation among local trans people.
</p>
<p>
Again, the actual top and bottom surgeries seem to have been done well (no complications yet), but in terms of Post-Op care etc he&#39;s pretty laissez-faire.

I use McKesson sterile lube... it&#39;s SUPER cheap, and my surgeon said it&#39;s no different than sergilube... packets are a terrible waste, and ive only had to buy 2 of these boxes in 2 years.

I disagree with the commenters suggesting to douche. Vaginal malodor is typically caused by the wrong microflora establishing itself inside the vaginal cavity, often due to a pH imbalance. The medical term for this is Vaginal Dysbiosis. Douching can further disrupt the pH, thereby worsening the problem. My surgeon (McGinn) recommends using a pH-balanced lube for dilating, specifically Almost Naked by Good Clean Love, and *not* douching. This will promote the growth of lactobacillus (&#34;good&#34; bacteria) in the vaginal canal, which in time should give it a healthy, yoghurt-like odor.
</p>
<p>
This early in your wife&#39;s recovery, sloughing tissue and serosanguinous fluid could also be contributing to malodor, but that will resolve in time as the tissue heals.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, make sure she&#39;s practicing good hygiene with the dilators, cleaning them with antibacterial soap after each use. There should be no need to boil the dilators. Also, whenever she pees, she should use a peri bottle to gently spritz her labia clean with water, then pat dry. And if she doesn&#39;t already know: wipe front to back after bowel movements (ie, away from her vulva).
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

What surgeon is this? A minute at a time? Your wife needs to get seen by another doctor ASAP or this surgery is going to fail. If I sound concerned, it’s because I am. This is the critical healing stage and lack of dilation now is going to cause permanent problems. I cannot imagine who would send her home with no instructions and dilators that didn’t have any depth measurements. Depending on the technique, most people need 3 to 5 sessions a day for about 30 minutes each. However, I am not a doctor and I’m only recommending what most people have. She needs to see an actual physician or talk to her surgeon and I am hoping this is not one of the two American doctors that I know are high-risk and not recommended.

Dr Opoku in Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. My wife and I had to be apart for about a month due to me needing to stay where I am for work. For the weeks leading up to and immediately after her op, I would message her asking if she&#39;d been given some big handout yet, what I should prep for, and each time she relayed that &#34;the doctor says he&#39;ll go over it once the packing is out.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I found out about the dilation time/issues, where a few days after she&#39;d had the catheter/etc removed, she messaged me with &#34;Can you double check how long I&#39;m supposed to leave this in for? When he demonstrated at the appointment it was removed after about a minute.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Since then I&#39;ve been frantically Googling trying to figure out WTF else this dude never told her.
</p>
<p>
The dilators themselves, there are four of them. They&#39;re in like a little drawstring bag, and tbh kinda look just like silicone dildos with flat bases. Except that the &#39;tip&#39; is a little more pointed/tapered than on a dildo. They&#39;re completely unmarked, just solid colors in different sizes.
</p>
<p>
When I expressed surprise that she was already on the second biggest one, she told me that the surgeon claimed he &#34;gave her a wide vagina for easy dilation.&#34;
</p>
<p>
You are completely allowed to be intense or concerned. Right now I just need as much help/guidance as possible.

I&#39;ll be doing that, for sure.
</p>
<p>
Opoku is apparently a protege of Sherman Leis, but I can&#39;t find much on here about either of them except that Leis has/had a comment of making inappropriate comments.
</p>
<p>
But yeah I&#39;ll do everything I can to look into this and make sure she recovers as well as possible.

To add to what others have said, yes, she should be douching. Every surgeon (should) have their own douching instructions i.e. frequency, whether to use soap or not, etc.
</p>
<p>
My personal instructions for at least the first few weeks post-op while you still have open wounds, were to do a rinse 3x a day (I usually just do it after I dilate) and after bowel movements. I was told to first rinse with water with Johnson baby shampoo in it, and then a plain water rinse.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen some surgeons instruct patients to use distilled water, or boil their water (and then let it cool before dilating) if the local water has issues.

That makes a sense. Apparently the surgeon just said &#34;you should probably douche&#34; which is an infuriating lack of detail. When I call the place up I&#39;ll be speaking directly with the surgeon to get as much info as possible.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, it&#39;s been about a week since the packing was removed and no douching yet. Supposedly, the only other recs given were that they said she should wear some Depends for a few weeks and then eventually switch to pads. Going to double check THAT now because it seems increasingly likely that her GRS surgeon is a goober.

Im just curious but is it possible that the dilators are absorbing something in the material or somehow having a reaction and thats causing the smell? Maybe try a different set of dilators and see if the same still happens?

It&#39;s certainly possible! I know sex toys can have similar issues, so maybe the specific type of silicone and lube might be an issue. (The lube is water based, I do know silicone+silicone is a no-no).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll definitely have her try other dilators and see what happens.

She&#39;s using the third dilator (blue/aqua), and putting it in up to the base. Usually 10-12 mins but if it needs to be 30 mins I&#39;ll certainly let her know. I want to make sure this goes as well as possible for her.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the surgeon said he gave her a &#34;wide vagina&#34; to make dilation/healing easier, which...in retrospect and after doing some research, I&#39;m a little skeptical/ambivalent as to what he meant. (Like, yeah, okay, a wider cavity. But how? And is that advisable? Will a &#39;wide vagina&#39; have side effects? )

The whole thing? o.o? Did she get a sigmoid canal?

Just penile inversion. No orchiectomy or anything beforehand. Apparently no need for a a sigmoid canal.
</p>
<p>
Still concerned by the doc telling her he made the vagina &#34;wider&#34; for easier Post-Op care. He apparently said it&#39;d make dilation easy, but now that I&#39;m looking into this more, I&#39;m wondering how this would have been achieved and whether there are any potential side effects we should keep an eye out for.

Well, then it could be the lube.
</p>
<p>
I use MedPride lube jelly.  It&#39;s water solubile and a bacteriostatic (inhibits the growth of bacteria)
</p>
<p>
They could benefit from douching, especially if they are still in the early healing stages and had a traditional PIV, but they would want to consult with their surgeon to make sure it&#39;s OK. Mine told me it was OK around week 2. Did they have a traditional PIV or a hybrid (the difference is mostly long term maintaince)

As for it being wider, I can&#39;t see why it would be a problem, sounds cool to me.

Given that it sounds like your wife may be experiencing bacterial vaginosis, I would highly recommend avoiding cheaper glycerine-containing lubricants and instead getting something which is pH balanced. Ideally with a pH around 4. I used OptiLube for the first couple months and a 150ml tube lasted me.. maybe 6 dilation sessions at best. I&#39;m now using Yes WB Lube which costs 5 times as much, but it lasts me 25 or so dilation sessions. It&#39;s about the same cost overall.
</p>

Lubricant brands which are pH balanced will usually be raving about the fact. If you have to dig for it beyond looking at the manufacturer&#39;s product page, chances are they aren&#39;t pH balanced.
</p>
<p>
If going the pH balanced route, you may want to look into vaginal microflora supplements to accelerate the process. If not going the pH balance route and instead using SurgiLube or other glycerine lubes, then don&#39;t bother with this.

I have used many different dilators (I own about 20). Silicone dilators are fine, but if they&#39;re retaining a smell then that suggests to me that they are poorly made and that the silicone was not degassed during the manufacturing process, meaning that the surface of the dilators will be covered in teeny tiny holes that harbour bacteria. Bien Australia do high quality dilators, though they have an aggressive shape. CalExotics do tapered dilators which max out at about 32mm (they said 35mm but my calipers disagree), which can be useful up to a point but if you&#39;re already on larger sizes than this then I would recommend looking at alternatives. Soul Source dilators are excellent, though they are completely solid and have no &#34;give&#34;; this still works for the majority of people, silicone is just slightly more comfortable (although some silicone types require a bit more lube, as lube seems to kind of.. pool on the surface. Not much of a problem if dynamically dilating or on a comfortable size, just difficult if you&#39;re sizing up really).
</p>

Note that the lubricant brands I have listed are only really available in the EU/UK. I&#39;ve heard good things about Almost Naked by Good Clean Love which GenderRebellious recommended, and google tells me it has a pH of 4.2-4.7.
