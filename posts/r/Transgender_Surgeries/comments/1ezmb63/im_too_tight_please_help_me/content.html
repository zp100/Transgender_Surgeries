So a lot of things could be contributing to this but it&#39;s hard to say without much information. First, DO NOT SIZE UP IF YOU&#39;RE NOT READY, this can cause a lot of damage. Also positioning is important! You should be at a 45 degree angle when dilating, not fully upright or fully laying down flat. Also you shouldn&#39;t be forcing it in, what I do is I will push it in until I get some push back then leave it there for a bit, maybe a minute or so then push some more. The important thing that my doctor told me is that dilating isn&#39;t &#34;get to max depth and hold it&#34; it&#39;s a slope. When I dilate, I start with 4 dots showing and after 20 minutes I only have 1 dot showing. If you aren&#39;t already, I highly recommend seeing a physical therapist. It&#39;s also important to know what kind of pain it is, is it pressure? Is it a sharp shooting pain? Soreness, or like when you press on a bruise? If it is pressure then that doesn&#39;t really go away it just gets easier. If it&#39;s the others it&#39;s possible you could have granulation. I had a similar experience to what you&#39;re describing and it was actually due to having granulation down the entire length of my canal. After it was treated everything seemingly went back to normal. If it&#39;s too painful don&#39;t hesitate to size down. As long as the space is being dilated that&#39;s what matters. I would talk to your doctor and maybe schedule an appointment about this as well. Hopefully this is helpful to you. Also probably the most important is that this is a marathon not a sprint, it&#39;s a major surgery and can take up to a year to fully recover.

Thank you! im basically doing everything you said, except for the 45 degree angle. i lie down flat but have a pillow supporting my head but next time i dilate i&#39;ll see if that helps. also, i&#39;m not forcing it in as my post made it seem, i can get my dilator in easily, and reach the 2nd dot, then over a minute or 2 with some pressure i can reach final dot without any problems. the pain isn&#39;t coming from inside my canal as i might&#39;ve implied? it&#39;s more the vulva/ first little bit of my canal. as in when i the dilator is reaching its widest point and it&#39;s stretching the entrance? it&#39;s kind of hard to explain. i&#39;ve been using the blue dilator for a week now, and holding it for 15 minutes, but it only hurts while dilating. it&#39;s like a stretching type of pain but it hurts a little more mainly cuz it&#39;s my coochie. i feel as if i&#39;m ready, and i do have a slightly higher pain tolerance. i have my 1 month appointment in like 4 days so they will likely be able to help me, i mean it might be just because im also swollen but idk girl

Oh gosh, the 45 degree angle might be just what you need. I tried dilating while laying flat a couple of times and it was hell. Also, while inserting it, I’ve found it helpful to do like a mini crunch and curl my back up. Idk why but when I engage my abs, I relax my pelvic floor - it’s weird.

Lol I feel you. And I had mine June 10th so I&#39;m not that far ahead of you but I know the feeling, I have the stretching feeling with the green. You may just need time, and unfortunately dilating won&#39;t always be comfortable but it shouldn&#39;t be painful. The only thing I can think of is that you could have granulation, that&#39;s what caused me a lot of the pain you&#39;re describing. After mine was treated it&#39;s just pressure I feel now.

Hey, reading this,  do you mean your body is 45 degrees or the dilator? Because I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re fine to be flat, and the dilator needs to be 35-45 degrees. At least that was my surgeons advice.

Find a pelvic floor physical therapist and be patient with yourself. My wife went through similar issues. She actually had to size down and start with the petite dilators in the beginning bc her pelvic floor was so tight.

I was going to say angle the dilator but it seems that’s been said. Who was your surgeon?  They can usually give you an idea as to a depth you had after surgery. Also…and this is key with PPT…Are you absolutely certain you aren’t going into your urethra?  Especially if you weren’t angling the dilator, this can be what’s happening.
</p>
<p>
Have you spoken with your surgeon about this?  You’re just about at the month mark so are you not seeing the surgeon for follow ups?  Ask them and maybe show them what you’re doing and they can help.
