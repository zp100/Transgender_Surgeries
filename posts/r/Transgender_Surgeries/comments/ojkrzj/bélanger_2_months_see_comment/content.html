Just past two months post OP, SRS with Dre. BÃ©langer. Still a little swollen and scarred, but aside from that I&#39;m able to walk and run and jump etc just like before surgery, without any pain. (DW though, I&#39;m making sure not to push myself too hard or do anything stupid). Just had my first orgasm. It kind of came out of nowhere tbh. A lot of women have said that clitoral stimulation is the way to go, but I personally found I got a lot more out of penetration with a vibrator (and a few neck kisses). Pretty in line with orgasms before SRS but after HRT. Logistically a lot simpler and less dysphoric though. Lemme know if you have any questions ðŸ™‚

Sorry for the weird way Iâ€™m responding (Iâ€™m kinda an old man when it comes to Reddit/technology) Iâ€™m a trans man whoâ€™s been on hormones for a little over 2 years.  But, what you described as your orgasm sounds exactly like the orgasms Iâ€™d have before I was on T.  Cis female orgasms, I guess is how youâ€™d say it. (Iâ€™m trying to be politically correct without being offensive iâ€™ve got quite a lot of learning to do coming from a transphobic and homophobic family even though all their kids are lgbtq+) but yeah, your vagina looks great and healthy and Iâ€™m super excited and happy for you that you are able to achieve good orgasms and have a beautiful vagina!

Yeah, BÃ©langer has really good recovery. I never had to take the narcotics they gave me either. By the time the ketamine and tap wore off after surgery, I never needed anything stronger than acetaminophen; and I&#39;ve heard a couple of my friends who had her say the same thing.

Trans man here, may I ask how your orgasm differs post-op as opposed to pre-op?  Iâ€™m hoping to get phalloplasty eventually and realized that Iâ€™ve done loads of research on FTM surgeries but none on MTF.  I feel itâ€™s good to learn about both.
</p>
<p>
P.S. Looks like youâ€™re healing nicely!

Thanks! The orgasm itself post-op and pre-op are essentially the same tbh. The only real difference is that the technique for achieving it is a lot more natural, feels a lot more right, and requires far fewer hands (basically there used to be two places that needed stimulation, and those two places have now been beautifully merged into one single vaginal cavity that does it all).
</p>
<p>
The real difference has actually been HRT, which basically flipped everything on its head. Pre-HRT was really a lot more straightforward. I had a lot more of a sex drive, which could be activated by visual stimulation. And when I&#39;d have sex or masturbate, it&#39;s kind of like everything was there to build up to this final moment of climax. It was also very easy for me to get myself off. In fact, it was much harder to abstain for too many days in a row.
</p>
<p>
After HRT though is completely different. I really need to be in the mood for anything to work at all, and especially now, there&#39;s not a lot I can do without a partner. I can easily go for months without even thinking about sex (the clinic does ask for a bit of celibacy before and after surgery). Achieving orgasm is a lot more of a challenge, and it definitely had its learning curves (both in the first year of HRT, as well as now post surgery), but I think the orgasms are better in a lot of ways. It&#39;s a lot more of a full body experience, and in fact for it to work, my entire body really needs to be stimulated (hence my comments about neck kisses in my post, and part of why I need a partner). My vagina and my breasts and my neck etcetera feel a lot more inextricably connected if that makes sense. There also isn&#39;t the same big moment of climax. Like blueballs aren&#39;t really a thing anymore. Orgasms come on a lot more gradually; they last a lot longer; and rather than &#34;finishing&#34;, they just sort of start to become too much after a little while. It&#39;s definitely more powerful. I can&#39;t really help but moan and whatnot. And afterwards, there&#39;s kind of this lingering state for a few moments, where I can barely move from exhaustion, and yet touching me anywhere on my body makes like all of my muscles contract.

Glad to hear recovery is going well for you too. I&#39;m also two months post op from BÃ©langer and am back to doing physical activities as well. It&#39;s great to be back to normal.

Aw man, what a coincidence. I wonder if we ever bumped into each other at the AsclÃ©piade. Were you there for that random really cold night? I&#39;m glad you&#39;re recovery is going well too! BÃ©langer seems to have pretty consistently good results from everyone I&#39;ve talked to. But then again I suppose that could be that there isn&#39;t the sample size yet.

I had my surgery on May 10th so it&#39;s very likely we could have bumped into each other there. I do remember that cold night and making the mistake of keeping my room window open during it lol. It doesn&#39;t seem like a fluke that BÃ©langer has multiple good results, she seems to be good at what she does.

Lol, true. Well with COVID and all I unfortunately didn&#39;t get to meet whole a lot of people. But there was a few, including one woman about my age who used to go to my university. I hope her recovery is going well. And I hope that, thanks to all the bioinformaticians who&#39;ve brought us these brilliant mRNA vaccines, that the job market opens up a bit and she&#39;s able to find something better suited to her qualifications ðŸ™‚
