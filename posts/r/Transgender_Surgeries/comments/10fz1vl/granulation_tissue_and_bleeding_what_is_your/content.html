I had granulation tissue treated inside the neovagina due to some bleeding the last two weeks. How long have you ladies experienced bleeding? I resume dilation today but woke up with a pad full of blood and it‚Äôs just freaking me out. Reassurance from some surgery sisters is needed today. üòû

Just an aside, ‚Äúgranulation‚Äù is what happens during normal healing, ‚Äúhyper‚Äù granulation is what we‚Äôre talking about here.
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôll experience granulation until about month 4 ish with normal healing.
</p>
<p>
With granulation. You‚Äôre not usually actively bleeding, but you‚Äôll see blood as the nitrate shrinks the granulation, forms scabs that then expel themselves from your canal.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, you‚Äôll have a scab over the internal granulation that will peel off during dilation and you‚Äôll see really dark blood expel itself.
</p>
<p>
Granulation itself can definitely cause bleeding from it being pulled and ripped during dilation.
</p>
<p>
In the days to 2 weeks after being treated, you‚Äôll see like strawberry jammy type substance come out of you either on a pad, douching, or after dilation.
</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôre actively bleeding, I‚Äôd consult a gyno, your primary care, or a wound specialist.

I have a small spot of granulation near my urethra that still spots a bit if I get overly ambitious with my dilators or a toy. I‚Äôm 14 months post and the only reason the spot is still there is because the last time I saw my surgeon (9 mos post), he had changed practices and there wasn‚Äôt a molecule of silver nitrate to be had).

You can try a wound specialist! They‚Äôd be able to see you more consistently than your surgeon- i needed weekly applications of silver nitrate for a month or so at the end of my healing because the granulation kept granulating.

Is granulation an unavoidable step in the healing process of all surgical techniques?

My friend who has had both stages of colon vaginoplasty has had this, and it‚Äôs easily fixable with silver nitrate. That‚Äôs what they used on her and the bleeding stopped and she was fine. It did obviously scare her the first time she saw it, but her surgeon told her it happens during the healing process.

Thanks. I had the silver nitrate treatment on Wednesday and that day it was just a bloody mess. I was bleeding until yesterday evening. Blood on the pad was extremely scary. Luckily my team is great was really just looking for support and seeing others experience. Today the bleeding is minimal and only occurs during dilation.

I am glad that it has resolved itself finally. I must admit that is the part that scares me the most about having my bottom surgery where I am able to get it done

Thanks! It has definitely gotten better since my last silver nitrate treatment. But that Wednesday was rough. And my dehiscence area is getting much better. She still looks like she‚Äôs been beat up but but it is still only week 8.
