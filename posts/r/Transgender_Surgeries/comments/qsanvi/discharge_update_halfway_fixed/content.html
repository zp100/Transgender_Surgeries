I had the same exact issues. Dr recommended douching regularly, had metronidazole like 6 times (both oral and gel), even was given stuff for a yeast infection. Found those suppositories on Amazon as I was desperate (I also had extreme pain caused by this), and I used em once a day for 5 days and haven&#39;t had a problem since. I also take pro-biotic supplements too that have cranberry and supplements for vaginal health and I haven&#39;t had that discharge or pain in over a month. Like total life saver

I am pre-op, so... take as just knowledge from a bunch of reading.
</p>
<p>
But, that seems like an excessive amount of douching - especially if you are using anything more than just water regularly.  While your body is - hopefully - trying to establish a healthy environment in there, you are flushing away its progress.  Not saying you don&#39;t feel the need to keep clean, but even a CIS vaginal possessor douching that often would likely have issues.
</p>
<p>
just a thought. üíúüíú

hey, i agree in theory, and i have tried to stop douching a few times.
</p>
<p>
but in practice, it&#39;s not just tenable to stop douching, especially while dilating so often and having recurring b.v./infections/discharge. it gets to the point where if i don&#39;t clean it out, the smell can be smelled through my clothes and everything. douching (and now boric acid) are the only things that have made any kind of effect on the discharge.

I mean aside from the discharge issue I don&#39;t mind my results. Like the other issues I had were kind of my fault but he&#39;s been supportive through my recovery even talking to the drs directly at the hospital I was in when I ended up septic (the hospital I went to wanted to cut me back open and wouldn&#39;t take my word for it and I was like noooo you won&#39;t put it back together even halfway as nice.) But I mean my labia minora is a touch lacking but I can live with that and everything else looks and functions ok. Granted the tunica graft that they use now I&#39;ve kind of noticed may not be as effective as like ppt for internal lubrication.

I‚Äôm incredibly late to this conversation, but I‚Äôm about 6 months post-op from Dr. Pang and around 2 months ago I developed case of BV. I was instructed to use a probiotic douche every few days by the office but after close to a month with no improvement of symptoms (swelling, general pelvic discomfort, and foul smelling discharge) I was seen by a GYN and was diagnosed with BV officially‚Äîthe visit was actually pretty traumatic because the GYN‚Äôs commentary during the exam reiterated to me that my vagina was incredibly different from ones she‚Äôs seen, mostly cis. I went on vaginal clinda for about a week, and 4-5 days after stopping I noticed a slight resurgence of discharge; this time I didn‚Äôt wait for things to get any worse and did another week of it. I‚Äôm currently on the second course and when I finish I‚Äôm going to attempt the boric acid suppositories‚ÄîI‚Äôm praying for this to finally be overüò©.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm definitely not satisfied with my results aesthetically, although sensation is amazing and sexually the canal is functional and patent. I‚Äôm currently pursuing ffs, but I‚Äôm guessing when I‚Äôm recovered and settled from that I am going to look into a revision, definitely for aesthetic purposes, but also to see if I can incorporate the peritoneal lining to some degree. I‚Äôm also not happy with how poorly this issue was addressed‚Äîwith pang moving his practice it seems as if they kind of washed their hands of things, which left me scrambling to find a provider that has at least some knowledge of neovaginas.  Do I regret choosing mt Sinai? Kind of, but I also wasn‚Äôt interested in waiting years upon years to get this surgery.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope you‚Äôre doing better!‚ò∫Ô∏è

that was my experience too. he claimed that he&#39;d only ever seen this one time before (obviously false from the other pang patients i&#39;ve talked to), and then prescribed ineffective treatments. the boric acid is the only thing that helped -- please try it! it fixed my issues permanently. when i told him about it he laughed it off and said he&#39;d never heard of women putting acid in their vaginas before in a shocked tone of voice ,,, i was like ,, bro. vaginas are literally acidic.
