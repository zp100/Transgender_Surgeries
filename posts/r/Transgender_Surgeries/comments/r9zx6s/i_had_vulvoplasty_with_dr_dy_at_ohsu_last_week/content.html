I have nothing but free time at home during recovery, so I wanted to outline my experiences last week. First of all, Dr. Dy, and the staff at OHSU, were all amazing. Dr. Dy has a radiant, highly experienced bedside manner. The other staff at OHSU Urology, from the PAs to meal service folks, were also similarly awesome. From the pre-op appointments until chatting the morning after surgery, Dr. Dy was fantastic.
</p>
<p>
I was in the hospital for two nights, and was able to get up and walk around a handful of times without too much issue. Just needed someone to help stabilize me when I felt dizzy. It took me a long time to properly &#34;wake up&#34; while I was in the anesthesia recovery area. Memories are hazy, so I mostly remember someone putting me on supplemental oxygen (via nasal cannula), and drinking apple juice. I had zero nausea from the general anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
On the third day, I was sent home with my dressings and catheter still in place. That was a struggle to deal with, even for the short period of time. The dressings really restricted the catheter, so minor bumps or tugs would cause a lot of pain (normally such minor movements are uncomfortable and weird, and much less actually painful). I was sent me home with a stack of bed pads, so I laid it on top of my bedding, grabbed my favorite blankets and pillows, and slept that way.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, bright and early, I returned to OHSU for dressing and catheter removal. I was provided a mirror to help see the initial results as staff were walking me through it. I liked what I saw! We weren&#39;t able to determine how much depth my &#34;dimple&#34; ended up having.
</p>
<p>
Before the catheter was removed, my bladder was filled with a saline solution to accommodate the &#34;pee test.&#34; No dice for 20 minutes. Staff were kind and incredibly patient. I drank more water, tried to calm my nerves, and eventually had to push through the anxiety. Literally. Pushing that much, so soon after the surgery, was intense, but it did eventually provide results. I popped my first sanitary pad into my underwear, and left the building feeling really positive.
</p>
<p>
Since then, I&#39;ve had a hilarious amount of swelling and bruising. Labia majora and mons are so swollen that I often laugh when I see them. Poor girl! Medications and wound care keep pain well controlled, so I&#39;m just dealing with the discomfort (and chafing) caused by the swelling.
</p>
<p>
Incisions and bodily functions in the area are doing great. Lots of discharge from the incisions, but pads take care of that. When I can move around the swollen bits, I&#39;m pretty mobile. Friends have been stopping in to check on me, and help out with the tasks I&#39;m unable to do right now. With one week of recovery done, I&#39;m anxiously waiting for the worst of the swelling to start subsiding.
</p>
<p>
Pro tip: if you have pets that like jumping on your lap--watch out! First night I was back home, my cat jumped directly onto my surgical site, and it felt like my soul left my body for a moment. Keep a pillow handy to protect the area if you have pets that might attempt the same.
</p>
<p>
My only other advice is about dressing properly if you know you&#39;re going to leave the hospital with a catheter still in. I brought loose sweatpants, but things would have been MUCH easier if I&#39;d worn a dress or skirt (although I own neither due to my personal style and presentation). If I&#39;d worn a skirt, the catheter line would&#39;ve been much easier to deal with, prevent kinks/snags, and move around with.

Thanks for sharing! I have my consultation in May with the team to (hopefully) get the ball rolling on vaginoplasty with Dr Dy, there is just not a lot of information out there on her right now, especially her aesthetic results.

Good luck with your consultation! OHSU does have photos of Dr. Dy&#39;s work, but you won&#39;t see any of it until your consults. OHSU takes a lot of photos, but keeps them close to their chest until you&#39;re in a seminar or consultation setting.

Thank you! And yeah that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard, I can understand why they do it that way. I&#39;m very much looking forward to meeting the team and getting to see something that will give me an idea of what I might be able to expect :)

My consult was finally scheduled about two weeks ago for May, it took almost a month of me constantly checking on them (I called about twice a week) to get it scheduled after my PCP sent over my referral and my therapist sent over letter # 1. Stay on them, they are understaffed and overworked and stuff gets dropped.

I&#39;m not sure what robot she uses for PPT, but I chose vulvoplasty for 100% personal reasons. I wanted low maintenance and less risk. I know many folks say they selected vulvoplasty due to their sexual preferences--and that was a part of it for me as well (I&#39;m a lesbian), but not the biggest factors. PPT vaginoplasty has been around for awhile, and is really safe and well-researched, so don&#39;t get me wrong about vulvoplasty somehow being dramatically less risky or something. It&#39;s all personal choice, and I made my choice based on factors that mattered most to me. And the fact that I chose vulvoplasty isn&#39;t an indictment of vaginoplasty.

Are you going to add a vaginal canal later or are you sticking with zero depth?

For me, if I&#39;d wanted a canal, I would have elected for a vaginoplasty from the get-go. While PPT provides a method to add a canal with less visible donor tissue, going for vulvoplasty was a personal choice that I made with confidence. My decision to not pursue vaginoplasty is not an indictment of the surgery, or anyone who selects it.

I have been considering Dr Dy and I am glad to hear good things. I just had an orchi the day before Thanksgiving with Dr Chouhan and had a similarly nice experience with the staff and facility.

Hi there!  I had an orchi done with OHSU a few weeks ago, and am following up to get vulvoplasty soon.  Can I ask, how has your healing come along?  Did the recovery get easier week by week, or were there any complications?  For how long did you need a caretaker at home?  I have so many questions, and you’d be the perfect person to answer them.  I hope you don’t mind.

Hello! I need to write a follow-up post for this sub eventually. For now, I&#39;ll do my best to answer your questions! And congrats on the orchi! I&#39;m a little over eight weeks post-op currently. Early on, healing definitely improved weekly. It&#39;s currently a slower progression from week to week, but continuing nonetheless. I&#39;m doing good, but still need a donut pillow for long periods of sitting, have random minor discomfort throughout each day, and some stubborn, slow to heal spots along my outermost incisions.
</p>
<p>
Only complication has been granulation. A lot of my discomfort in the first month was caused by granulation, so I saw a big boost to overall comfort after the first in-office treatment. I had another treatment a couple weeks ago, and am now only just keeping an eye out for any other spots that might pop up. If that&#39;s cleared up, I won&#39;t be seeing Dr. Dy again until my six month checkup. Fingers crossed!
</p>
<p>
I never had a caretaker at home. Instead, I created a Slack with 10-12 of my friends who wanted to help out. Including one or two I knew would be able to help me with more delicate matters, should the need arise (it didn&#39;t). When I needed something, usually on a weekly basis, I post a message, and then said friends would volunteer and coordinate. For example: weekly grocery run person would get sent my shopping list, recommended store, and then be in touch if there were any substitutions or things missing. They&#39;d drop off the groceries, hang out for awhile, and take care of any household tasks that they had time for (take out trash, empty cat&#39;s litter bin, pick up packages from parcel lockers, etc). You&#39;ll want to limit your activity as much as possible, and depending on healing and pain levels, even simple tasks like checking the mail, if it&#39;s a short walk through your building, may be uncomfortable. I&#39;ve been able to resume almost all of my household chores and errands in the last few weeks, but still pay close attention to what my body/surgical site is telling me.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to reply here, or DM me, if you have any further questions! I&#39;ll try to condense all of my experiences, recommendations, and thoughts into another post on this sub eventually.

I’m really happy to hear that your experience went so well. This is one of two options for me and I really like what I’m seeing and hearing.
</p>
<p>
Did you decide to work with the physical therapist (specialized in pelvic floor)
</p>
<p>
How was the pre op experience ? I expect a certain amount of hoops to jump through, but are office staff helpful in this area?

I&#39;m not required to see OHSU&#39;s in-house pelvic floor PTs for vulvoplasty. I believe that&#39;s a big part of the vaginoplasty recovery process at OHSU.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op was good! It took awhile to get the initial consult, but then things went smoothly from there. Timeline was shorter (less waiting) for vulvoplasty due to shorter hospital stay, less complicated surgery (AFAIK), and not electrolysis/hair removal requirement for surgical site.
</p>
<p>
I have Kaiser Permanente NW for insurance, so Kaiser&#39;s Gender Pathways clinic(s) work closely with OHSU for affirming surgeries in my area. So the two organizations were often talking or passing along data, paperwork, and such without too much input from me.
</p>
<p>
The folks at OHSU Urology who do these surgeries are awesome! All my questions were fielded really well, responses were quick, and I never felt like there was something I couldn&#39;t ask about, or focus on.

I read through their info booklet, which was really well done. I did see that working with the PT is optional. I’ve worked with a few PTs over the years and usually in my opinion it’s a good idea. I was just wondering if you had any opinions on it. That’s cool.
</p>
<p>
I’m pretty well settled on OHSU doing my procedures now. Thank you!!
