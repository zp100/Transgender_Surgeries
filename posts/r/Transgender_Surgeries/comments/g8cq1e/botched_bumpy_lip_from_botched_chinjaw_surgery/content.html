Ever since having the procedures with him my lip remains messed up. It is bumpy, crooked, asymmetrical and has rolled in. Can&#39;t eat without it seeming to want to move inside my mouth. I would urge other transwomen here to take more notice of the negative reviews of the surgeons that they are considering.

Thank you. I hope this serves as a warning to many transwomen out there. Without us as patients they are nothing. They are really ought to always ensure our surgeries are done right. No excuses.

Thanks. It&#39;s what it is now. Whilst Bart can sleep, eat and wake up the same, my life has turned upside down. Please do not go to him. It is always safer to see a more experienced and conservative surgeon. Like you I thought, his negative reviews were isolated cases. I was wrong. Go somewhere else even if they are more conservative and expensive. And please warn others. I wouldn&#39;t want more of my trans sisters to experience what I have.

I do have this extreme cold and hot sensation to my chin when I lay down that&#39;s is so intense it hurts. It&#39;s like someone is squeezing the tissues inside my chin so hard. My chin feels like it is twitching from pain. I take some pain killers which helps a little for a bit. It&#39;s strange cause I&#39;m over 2 months post op.

Hopefully it isn’t nerve damage and just nerves reconnecting. 2 months is super early. I am post op srs 2 months and it’s still not quite there at all.

It&#39;s hard to say. I may get some sort of scan and ask a local surgeon if they can look for signs of nerve damage.

I haven&#39;t seen a local surgeon cause of lockdown and laser clinics are also closed. I plan to see one once all is back to normal. I wish COVID came before my surgery to be honest, it would have probably saved me from having this surgery as I would have had additional info here from Reddit.

What did the clinic you had surgery from say though? Of course you can’t go back right now but they can tell you to either be patient or come back after corona for a free fix. Surely this isn’t their ideal outcome.

Nothing useful they kept saying it is all normal. Like anyone with a brain can tell it isn&#39;t. I won&#39;t go back to Bart to touch me. His revisions are known to be worst. I&#39;ve read both Lana and another girl&#39;s posts here who went back to him to fix the botched job and they both said wished they never did. If he can&#39;t do it right the first time, how can he do it right the second time? Heck it is bonework yet Bart who likes to refer to himself many times as an OMFS fucked me up so bad. He doesn&#39;t even know what the bump under my chin is. How could he not know when he was the one cutting my bones during the op? Add to that his clumpsy lipo that left me with scarring. I&#39;m broke and will probably end up using all my savings to fix his mess.

I wish I had known sooner. I only read Realself and was lured by the recent reviews on YouTube. I removed him from my list 2 years ago but then I forgot. My first choice of surgeon was hard to have a consult with and so ended up going to him. When I was there, I saw like 10 girls for that week and the week I came back there were new ones. Some were also very young. Imagine if mine went wrong someone sometime this year and the next and the next will end up in my situation adding to the list. Before the community realises he is terrible, it will be too late. I even had people who despite what I said still want to go to Bart. He is cheap because he is inexperienced. I thought he would do a good job on me since he refers to himself as a OMFS but I was very wrong. I also think that if you go alone, not Belgian or a Youtuber, he is likely to do a half arsed job. I doubt he cares if you die.

No no procedure done to my lip but since the surgery everything about my lip got messed up. From the size, the way it looks and its movement. It&#39;s asymmetrical and loopsided at times. And it moves high and my upper teeth sit on it when I smile big. I have no idea what happened. After lockdown is lifted I do plan to see a local surgeon.

Nope. I honestly wouldn&#39;t let him touch your forehead if I were you. If you search the posts about MONA and a former patient of Bart started suffering from some sinus and breathing problems because her forehead was overfilled with bone cement. If you also take note of his credentials he doesn&#39;t have training in plastic surgery yet he performs them. An OMFS, ENT or craniofacial surgeon does not give them the ability or license to perform plastic surgery unless they&#39;ve received extensive training. Bart only took 8 months of training in PS according to Wikipedia which is nothing. Why only 8 months? Go figure. Yet he performs facelift, lipofilling, nosejob etc.. which are all plastic. He is an OMFS meaning his areas are the mouth, jaws and chin. But look at me I had my jaw and chin done and he still messed up badly.
</p>
<p>
In some of his patient videos if you watch them from beginning till end some of them mention pain in their forehead or something. Like I said in my posts here and on Realself, most if not all his patients have some lingering issues. Whether they maybe sagging jaws apparent on their Youtube testimonial or if they mention it themselves.
</p>
<p>
You can email them individually also and ask them they will tell you.

<p>
Not to minimize your experience in anyways but,
</p>
<p>
Can I ask how old you are?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in a Facebook group with alot of girls who have been to him and I&#39;d say 90% are very happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
Especially his forehead and orbital work, they look very good.
</p>
<p>
There are 2 I recall with negative things but they were much older in age.

Of course there will be those that are happy and so what? Should I just be happy with a botched result cause most are happy? If you want to go to him then go ahead. Those happy patients don&#39;t matter to me as my life is now ruined. This experience is about mine what does all these other patients&#39; results have to do with mine? Are my issues invalid cause most are happy? I wonder how these patients will feel about chewing on their lip everytime they eat. What does age have to do with my results?

I&#39;m sorry I think that came out wrong.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t mean to minimize your experience but I just have bigger case study in the Facebook group and can kind of hedge my bets more accurately since there are alot of reviews.
</p>
<p>
There are some negative ones in the group too and most of them are older. Theres some issue with their skin elasticity and even they say hes good on younger patients but older theirs alot of soft tissue unfavorable changes.

I&#39;m young enough. Not a single wrinkle on my face. Skin is clear and no acne. Eats healthily, takes multivitamins, uses clinical skincare. Need I say more. I&#39;m also from an ethnicity that can look much younger than their actual age. Parents are 50 years old and minimal wrinkles and look late 30&#39;s. Both have full head of hair. Need I say more. Like I said if you want to go to him then do it.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re desperate to worship Bart as your ideal surgeon go ahead. But don&#39;t tell me your hedges are more accurate? Have you experienced the complications of his botched patients? If not, then you don&#39;t know better.

I&#39;m not worshiping dr. Bart, I could care less as long as I find a doctor who fulfills my needs regarding my forehead. That could be him or someone else.
</p>
<p>
What I&#39;m saying is basic science.
</p>
<p>
The larger your pool of patients are the more accurate your good to bad reviews are and the more accurately you can hedge your bets.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what I mean when I say hedging my bets, cause there are multiple dozen of reviews on the Facebook group, which have negative ones as well mind you, but it&#39;s a more accurate portrayal of how many he gets right vs how many he fucks up.
</p>
<p>
Even suporn has patients who consider themselves botched, doesnt negate his positive results which overshadow the negative ones.
</p>
<p>
Just saying.

So what was the end goal of you &#34;just saying&#34;? I don&#39;t see how it is relevant? Also if you&#39;re talking about positive and negative reviews, have you not noticed Bart has the highest number of complications and negative reviews on realself, reddit and perhaps somewhere else compared to other FFS surgeons? Or do we need more botched cases under Bart&#39;s hands or an equal number of ruined lives to his happy patients?

You call complications bad results? Bad results could simply mean unsatisfactory results not complications. Those few that you refer to as simply bad results are people who have both functional and aesthetic problems since having surgery with Bart. Most are even with permanent damage not just &#34;BAD&#34; results.
