Thank you so much, it’s been hard trying to express my feelings about it. I never heard of medical tattooing but will look into it!

I too have a very similar outcome. I had VFS and tracheal shave at the same time and my surgeon said that if he took any more off it would likely damage my voice because my vocal cords were attached. I was not aware and neither was he until after surgery, but he did warn me it might not be super flat. I feel that mine is a little more raised, I think I went into surgery thinking it would be more flat. Ive had some microneedling and going to have some medical tattooing but the lady who does it said it will help camouflage it but it will never look like how it did before. I think I should have done a bit more research as it’s possible to get it done internally or below the chin which is more hidden, but he had good reviews. It causes me a lot of dysphoria because I know it is a reminder. Other people don’t notice it so much or at least don’t comment or ask. I am super envious of girls who are flat and have no scar.

Get scar gel and then use Tretinoin every night and eventually the scar will disappear. Tret is pretty awesome for that.

I went to Dr. Courey also in 2021 and he did the same thing with the same justification. I deeply regret that I didn&#39;t know any better. at this point 3 years out the scar is barely noticeable (i see it but others tell me they can&#39;t) but i also think the scar is a little bit adhered to the underlying cartilage which looks/feels a little weird.

Im so glad im seeing this comment. I truly think he was trying to gaslight me into thinking it was because my LARGE Adam’s apple, but it really didn’t tell me much. It doesn’t explain why he close that placement.

I had my VFS with him. It’s too early to tell if he did a great job, but I almost did not want to do the surgery with him because of his bedside manner. Won’t share the full details (maybe I’ll make my own thread about it later on when I’m fully recovered), but long story short, I realized I hated his personality during my pre-surgery appointment. Most of the time, I was working with the vocal therapist and didn’t really spend much time with Dr. Courey until before the surgery. I felt like it was too late to back out by then and just went on with the surgery.

Get some MedermaPM and use it every night for the next 5mos. That scar will disappear.

I am sorry your results were not what you were expecting. I would recommend looking into having the scar reduced with laser or speak to a plastic surgeon who can reduce the size of the scar as well.

I went with Dr. Courey for both the trach shave and VFS, and he did mention that certain Adams apples require different suture placement. I was lucky that, despite having a monster Adams apple, he was able to put the suture where you can&#39;t see it.
</p>

Sadly, not much you can do aside from getting the scar lasered to decrease its prominence. The thyroid cartilage horn can also only be shaved down so far before the vocal fold structure integrity is compromised. He took a TON off mine but I&#39;m still left with a slight point if I pull the skin taut. He warned me that skinny people tend to show the horn more. For the rest of the apple, you can ask a plastic surgeon to do a CT of your neck to get the exact depth of what they can take off, but Courey is pretty good at getting what he could.

I actually think you have a great result! There are many scar treatments available, especially scar-tatoos are a very good option, if you don’t want any laser near your throat.

I got medical tattooing for my scars but regret it in some areas because it looks weird when I tan but the neck area I liberally apply sunscreen on and limit sun exposure so this would be a ideal area for medical tattooing to hide it

Hi! Just stopping here to say that I have that same scar from c4 neck surgery. It’s a pretty common scar from that surgery. I know three other family members who also have that same scar from cervical spinal fusion surgery. I just wanted to tell you so that you know that scar doesn’t necessarily out you for the surgery you had.

I had my thyroid gland removed which left a similar scar (albeit a bit lower on my neck) it took a few years, but the scar faded and is not noticeable anymore.
