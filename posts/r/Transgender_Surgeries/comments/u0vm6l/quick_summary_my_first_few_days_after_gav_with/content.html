Well y&#39;all, I finally did it. After a ton of waiting, therapy and anxious trips to go get tested for covid, it&#39;s finally happened. I woke up at 3:30 in the morning on April 7th after a long day of pooping my brains out and drove 15 minutes down the road from my hotel to have my GAV with Marci Bowers. After an absolutely excruciating 4 hours, they hauled me off to start the next chapter of my life. The moment I felt the cold of the operating room it all sunk in, it was really happening. During a wonderful conversation with one of the doctors (who was also a trans woman) about her upcoming bottom surgery, they started administering the anesthesia and I dipped off into snooze land. Fast forward about 5 and a half hours later, and my world was forever changed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been beyond lucky so far, my pain has never gone above a 6, and has (for the most part,) been hovering around a 2 ever since the anesthesia wore off. They had me on toradol for the first day which never really allowed the pain to get too bad, after that they moved me over to a rotating schedule of Ibuprofen and Tylenol. I took one oxy before they removed the dressings and one oxy before bed that same night, but besides that it&#39;s just been Ibuprofen and Tylenol which have been keeping the pain at bay nicely.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure if I just have a high pain tolerance or if I set my expectations for the pain unrealistically high, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s been more uncomfortable than it has been painful so far. It also might be the 50 hours of electrolysis that prepped me for pain in the nether region. I&#39;m not going to lie to you, the catheter feels like absolute hell. It&#39;s like the feeling of fullness that you have after an extremely long car ride without a pit stop, but it never goes away. I literally can&#39;t wait to take this thing out of me. But besides that, everything just feels tight and a bit sore. Most of the tightness comes from the internal packing which will be removed at the follow up along with the catheter.
</p>
<p>
As far as the team, my experience couldn&#39;t have been better. Kimi, Abi and Una were standouts but I can&#39;t speak highly enough of the rest of the team as well. If I had a problem, you bet your booty that they were there at the press of a button to make me feel better.  They were always more than happy to explain things until it made sense to me, even if that meant repeating themselves multiple times. They also did an amazing job of making an uncomfortable experience feel safe and non judgmental.
</p>
<p>
As far as complications go, so far things have been smooth sailing. My only scary moment was passing out when I got up in a hurry and took my first poop. I had a successful poo but then the dizziness caught up with me, luckily between the nurses and my mom, they caught me, cleaned me up and we were right back on course for my afternoon walk that day.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read a lot of posts about Bowers &#34;lack of bedside manner&#34; and honestly, I don&#39;t see it? She&#39;s been nothing but lovely every time I&#39;ve seen her. Sure she&#39;s not swinging by to talk for hours or anything, but she&#39;s a busy woman with a lot on her plate. Besides the constant surgeries, working with WPATH, her work with FGM victims and having a family, shes got a lot on her plate. I don&#39;t expect her to talk for ages. She briefly checked in for a couple minutes every day just to see how I was doing and take a glance at how things turned out, and today she dropped by to remove the drain (which hurt a shocking amount less than I imagined in my head.) I just wanted to really emphasize how sweet she&#39;s been and how a lot of posts don&#39;t even come close to describing my experiences with her.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to leave y&#39;all with some highlights.

Meeting my fellow bottom surgery buddy was amazing. The nurses arent allowed to disclose information about other patients and they do an amazing job of respecting that, but she saw me at the pre op and then again at the hospital and requested the opportunity to meet. We went on a stroll around the hospital and talked about our stories and it was so so so refreshing. She&#39;s an absolute doll.
</p>

I had a midnight conversation about Minecraft and valorant with one of my nurses and it put such a massive smile on my face.

Looking between my legs for the first time after waking up. I was covered in dressings but holy moly, it was a life changing experience seeing my body without a penis sticking out.
</p>

<p>
The first time I got to lay eyes on my body after the dressings were removed, it changed my life. I saw my body for the first time, sure it was a bit bloody and bruised, but it was my body and that&#39;s a feeling I&#39;ll NEVER forget.

EDIT:  she does a heavily modified version of the penile inversion technique. She said she got me between 5 and 5 and 1/2 in of a depth and I ended up with pretty good labia definition even though I only had about 3 and 1/2 to 4 in to work with and I was circumcised. I am very impressed.

I think your right about Marci, she can only juggle so many things in 24 hrs and has her own life and family ties,.I think some patients expect her to be at their beck an call after the Trinidad, Colorado, tv series. She&#39;s a beautiful human being who champions standing against fgm, she gets my admiration all the time

Yeah she&#39;s been extremely attentive over email as well. I had a little bit of a rash and she responded to us within about 15 minutes, she&#39;s excellent at everything she does.
