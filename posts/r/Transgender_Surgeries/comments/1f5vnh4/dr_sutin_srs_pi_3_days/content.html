<strong>
Surgery date:
</strong>
-3 days
</p>
<p>
This morning I flew to Bangkok to meet the wonderful people at
<strong>
PAI Clinic
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
I arrived with my wife at Bangkok airport and there we were met by a PAI clinic driver. The car was very comfortable and the ride to the hospital was comfortable. At the clinic we were met by a wonderful receptionist named Bune, we had to wait 2 hours to see Dr. Sutin because we arrived very early, at this time we were invited to a rest room with soft chairs, a blanket and coffee. A very welcoming and friendly welcome.
</p>
<p>
Bune made a very positive impression on us, he is friendly and very active, he explained in detail the plan of action before the operation, helped us to fill out the forms and complete all the necessary paperwork. By the way, be sure to indicate in the questionnaire your allergies, it is very, very important for anesthesia and your safety.
</p>
<p>
Before meeting with the surgeon, I had my blood and urine drawn for testing and was invited for an initial consultation for a future SRS PI. Dr. Sutin is a very personable surgeon, he explained in detail how the surgery would go, what kind of skin he would use and what complications could happen. He answered all my questions and gave me a lot of his attention to make sure I understood what he explained.
</p>
<p>
I was accompanied throughout the whole process by an interpreter in my native language. A wonderful woman who helped not only with the translation but also supervised me every step of the way on the first day. I am very happy to know that the PAI employees care about your comfort. They also provided a personal driver for my entire day.
</p>
<p>
After blood tests and clinic consultation with Dr. Sutin:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Passed the consultation and approval of two Thai psychiatrists at an independent clinic
</li>
<li>
Had x-ray lungs.
</li>
<li>
Made an advance payment.
</li>
<li>
Check in to a hotel near the clinic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first day was very difficult, I did a lot of things to prepare.
</p>
<p>
Psychiatrists are not to be feared, they are very frendly and ask standard trans questions. Their aim is to diagnose you with F64. Yes, some countries have abolished this diagnosis, but nothing wrong with that, it&#39;s normal procedure for Thai laws. I went through them quickly, no longer than 1 hour for both visits.
</p>
<p>
I had my lungs x-rayed at the PAI clinic that will be performing my surgery. Don&#39;t be intimidated by this building, your surgery will be in the new state of the art building of this clinic. The x-ray was the fastest, it took no more than 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Then we checked into one of the wonderful hotels that the PAI clinic provides. This hotel is within walking distance from the clinic and it is very convenient for post-operative care. The hotel is comfortable and not expensive, the room has everything you need, including two separate beds and a large TV and refrigerator.
</p>
<p>
At this stage I am very happy with the way the preparation for SRS is going, the clinic team are as attentive as possible and always want to make sure you feel comfortable. I received lots of positive vibes and compliments on the day and look forward to having surgery soon with this team.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
As a bonus
</strong>
I am attaching answers from dr Sutin to my questions about the surgery.
</p>
<p>
<em>
1. What is the difference and which is better scrotal surgery or inversion only?
</em>
<br>
This will be a combined technique. Both scrotal and penile skin will be utilized to create full depth and function.
</p>
<p>
<em>
2. Can the clitoris be made smaller?
</em>
<br>
Dr. Sutin does not recommend making it smaller, there are risks that its sensitivity will be significantly reduced after surgery. (I&#39;ve seen pictures of his surgeries on reddit that the clitoris is very large, but the doctor assured me that it&#39;s swelling and in 6-12 months it will return to normal and be much smaller, which is what I want).
</p>
<p>
<em>
3. Do they give medications for nausea and constipation, which can be a side effect of anesthetics?
</em>
<br>
Yes, the clinic will provide everything.
</p>
<p>
<em>
4. How many free consultations and checkups do I have after surgery?
</em>
<br>
2-3 consultations within 15 days after surgery. If I stay in Thailand for a few months, I can visit their clinic for consultations further.
</p>
<p>
<em>
5. How long does the surgery last?
</em>
<br>
4-5 hours approximately.
</p>
<p>
<em>
6. How can I avoid the possibility of my surgery stitches tearing?
</em>
<br>
This complication occurs in 20% of cases. It is important to move very slowly during the first month, all movements should be as careful and smooth as possible, including dilatation.
</p>
<p>
<em>
7. What about the size of the clitoral hood?
</em>
<br>
Dr. Sutin creates a hood size as large as possible, depending on your skin.
</p>
<p>
<em>
8. When can I go back on HRT?
</em>
<br>
HRT can be continued 4 days after surgery
</p>
<p>
These were my main questions. Also, I showed him examples of his cases that I liked to give me an idea of what I wanted in terms of aesthetics, he took that into consideration and promised to do his best for the best results.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s how my first day went. Next I plan to buy my list of things for rehabilitation and stay in the clinic, and then start preparing my stomach for surgery, but I will tell you about it next time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Don&#39;t forget to ask questions in the comments,
</strong>
I&#39;ll be happy to share all the information I know. I am very happy that these people will help me transform my body!

For example, about the size of the labia minora or whether he can make them surround the entrance to the vagina completely or if he creates a clitoral frenulum

Did you encounter any difficulties while getting two psychiatric reports? I live in Europe and I will have to travel a long distance to go to Thailand. After going there, returning without getting two psychiatric reports would be devastating for me. Were there people who could not get this report and could not have surgery at the clinic?
