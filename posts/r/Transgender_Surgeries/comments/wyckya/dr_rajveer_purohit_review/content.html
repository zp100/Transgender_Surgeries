Just had a revision srs with Dr Purohit with the assist of Dr Wiklund in NewYork. He did not do my initial srs. He fixed the outside and inside by making it look more realistic and more deep with the colon sigmoid method. I think he did an amazing job. I’m like 9 days out from surgery and I feel great. I have no complaints I’m still getting used to the dilation routine again but I would think that’s normal. It’s my second day dilating and I can get the purple size past every dot all the way to the dent at the end of the dilator. I also already tried using the blue size and I can fit that in the same amount it takes alittle longer tho. The colon part doesn’t need dilation but the entrance part where the skin and stitches does. The appearance part what he did was transfer fat to my outer lips and also created a labia minora (the inner lips) which is what I wanted the most. My clit always looked normal so I didn’t have to do anything to it. I have feeling still and can orgasm since I’m healing tho I don’t feel like masturbating at the moment. Also the rumors of colon vagina smelling isn’t true at all it doesn’t smell at all. Anyways no complaints here I just wanted to give a review in case anyone was curious about going to him or getting colon sigmoid.

Did your labia majora get a fat transfer initially that didn&#39;t take?

I&#39;m glad to hear your recovery is going well. Would you mind sharing pics (maybe on dm, if you feel comfortable)?
