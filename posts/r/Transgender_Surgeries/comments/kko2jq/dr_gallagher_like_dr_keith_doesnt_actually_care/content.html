Dr. Gallagher, like Dr. Keith, doesn&#39;t actually care at all

Back in October, I posted about how Dr. Keith in NJ had strung me along and really didn&#39;t care:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jjakz9/jonathan_keiths_team_will_string_you_along/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jjakz9/jonathan_keiths_team_will_string_you_along/
</a>
</p>
<p>
It never ever mattered that his partner urologist kept failing to make a simple consultation.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Gallagher is now doing the exact same thing. The consultation was supposed to be on the 23rd, she missed it, and I&#39;ve been left hanging since.
</p>
<p>
This was after they showed a ton of sympathy about what I went through with Dr. Keith -- and turned around and did the exact same.

I think that things happen for a reason, and i really think that these 2 surgeons were not the ones for this special moment in your life, this is clearly a red flag, do not get surgery with surgeons that see their patients as paychecks and that do not care for their patiens

You&#39;re absolutely right. I&#39;ve heard both surgeons go above and beyond for their patients, but they consistently fail to do so for me. Entirely convinced a lot of that is planted reviews at this point.

I feel like this is unfortunately not all that uncommon.  I’m kind of going through the same thing with PAI right now. They keep running me around and I’m just trying to secure a date and put in a deposit!
</p>
<p>
I think a lot of these surgeons and offices suck at communicating well when it comes to getting the ball rolling for surgery.

It&#39;s really infuriating how surgeons string you along, and I got reassurances up front from Gallagher&#39;s people it&#39;d be different. Of course not...
</p>
<p>
Dr. Keith didn&#39;t so much give me the run-around as much as Dr. Bhalla, his partner urologist, who missed so many damn consultation appointments, and each time, it delayed everything by weeks.

I’m sorry to hear that. Especially with since you were initially reassured. I think a lot of them don’t understand our eagerness and desperation, this is something many of us have been waiting for for years!

Yes, it&#39;s so hard dealing with those waits. I&#39;ve been desperate to make this happen for years and had employers really string me along with false promises, and now that I finally have insurance coverage for it again, I&#39;m caught in a hell of bad communication issues and pandemic problems.

I don’t know why you got downvoted. There’s no way I could trust her at this point, but I know you mean well.
</p>
<p>
My mental health is in an extremely bad state, and even if a lot of that isn’t on her, they really dropped the ball when I needed things to be different.

Still nothing today. Tomorrow will make 6 days since the missed consult.
</p>
<p>
This is so utterly ridiculous. I&#39;m losing it worse than I ever have over here. There&#39;s no way I can forgive this.

Dr. Keith is new in the game.  I’ve seen one of Dr. Gallagher’s results and I think you dodged a bullet.  Try the NYC city surgeons who all seem to be getting good results with less complications and Dr. McGinn in Philly.

I&#39;m done pursuing things. I tried Dr. Keith, Dr. Selph, and Dr. Gallagher all this year and everything just always turned into a run-around about everything. I know COVID complicated a lot, but so much of it was people missing friggin appointments.
</p>
<p>
I attempted suicide on the 22nd because of how bad the stress was getting. I&#39;ve been supposedly within a couple of weeks of this happening for the better part of this year, and it&#39;s absolutely destroyed me. I can&#39;t take it anymore.

I had a similar problem with her. Had a consult back in August 2019, was working on sorting out insurance when I get a call in October that it&#39;s too late, she&#39;s moving to a new practice and it won&#39;t take your insurance for probably a year.
</p>
<p>
After a great deal of crying I found another surgeon. In the end it worked out, since the surgeon I ended up finding was great for me. But the experience with Gallagher did leave me a little bitter for sure.
