</p>
<p>
Now the story
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 0
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Going into surgery at 9 am, took first selfie round about 4 pm with everything done
</p>
<p>
Was waking about with an oxygen mask and tbh it was really nice, felt really powerful with it
</p>
<p>
I was mobilised directly in the evening after I got the injection to prevent thrombotic events
</p>
<p>
I was able to walk around quite good already
</p>
<p>
Pain only on the bandage and my ass üòÖ
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 1
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was waking up every our since 2 am, but i would still say I&#39;ve slept quite good
</p>
<p>
Pain is okish and still mostly on the bandage
</p>
<p>
What was done  1. I had a fistula to my bladder which they closed 2. They thinned out the labia majora 3. They made the labia minora more visible 4. They widened the opening of my vagina 5. They cut the connection between my labia minora out 6. They redirect my urethra slightly lower
</p>
<p>
Now i need the catheter for 9 days and the bandage in my vagina 3 days
</p>
<p>
Also i am able to move around and get up alone, but i need to do it slow
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 2
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doctors said it looks good, my surgeon might be able to see it next week
</p>
<p>
Nothing really new
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 3
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Bandage got removed it was really hurtful for me, especially the bandage in my vagina and when the nurse cut the stiches open where they sew the bandage on my skin
</p>
<p>
Also the head surgeon (markovsky) has looked at my kitty and pressed around which also really hurt
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 4
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It still looks good and I shall cool it more and don&#39;t move around as much
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 5
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nothing really new, the doctor just was surprised that i am that sensitive down there
</p>
<p>
Also i had a wet dream in the night to day 5 üôà so everything working i guess
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 6
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Was on the gynecological chair, what they found 1. It&#39;s really swollen 2. I have a wound healing problem (again) 3. Overall it looks good  4. I&#39;m really sensitive down there
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 7
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Still everything looking great, according to Dr. Klemenz the healing problem is definitely visible
</p>
<p>
Have Lavanid to counter the problem
</p>
<p>
I really have the feeling I need to pee üò¨, gladly i got a medication against it in the evening cause the Cather will still be in for 2 days
</p>
<p>
As everytime if you have any questions just go ahead and ask them :3

Hey! Thank you sooo much for sharing. üôèÔ∏è You said they fixed a fistula. Tbh i was a bit surprised. I couldn&#39;t find anything like this on the list of planned things for the revision. Did they only found out during surgery? Haven&#39;t you had any symptoms?

I had symptoms but it wasn&#39;t 100% sure that i have one.
</p>
<p>
They have done a cystoscopy and then found it. It was very very tiny and that&#39;s why I had very mild symptoms.

I know it&#39;s been a while but what kind of symptoms did you have that led you to believe that you might have an urinary tract fistula?

I needed to wear pantiliner all the time, cause i always had something coming out of my vagina and turns out that was urine.
</p>
<p>
But that was like the only thing that made me question it, cause still needing them months after surgery was not common.

Ah okay. Great that they were able to fix it.
</p>
<p>
I stopped wearing pantyliner altogether from day 20 because I had no discharge or bleeding at all. I guess I just got really lucky with how fast my body healed.
