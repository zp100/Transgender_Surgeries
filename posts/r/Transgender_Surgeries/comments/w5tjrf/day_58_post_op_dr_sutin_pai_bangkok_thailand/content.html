What made you choose PAI over the other surgeons in Thailand? I&#39;m seriously considering bottom surgery, and I hear the surgeons here in Canada are... not great. I liked what I heard about Dr. Suporns&#39; (sp?) technique, using mucous membranes from the urethra etc. to produce a more cis-looking vagina that lubricates. But good god-*damn* I am very envious of your results!

I chose PAI because of the technique they used. As u can see I have the urethral mucosa going down the front of my vagina and also it&#39;s used for the vaginal lining. I saw we the healed results of PAI and not mention I couldn&#39;t find 1 single bad review for them in reference to be ottoman surgery. All the others had multiple bad reviews about care , results etc. PAI was also the least expensive which told me 2 things 1. It wasn&#39;t about the money. 2. They are humble I on paid $10,230.00 USD.  and the care was top notch they treated me like an a queen and they also were very friendly and communication was key. I love my results I have no regrets at all about using PAI and super happy I didn&#39;t choose anyone else. I e heard of people using all kinds of issues with the other surgeons in Thailand and VA absolutely refused to have long healing, painful dialation etc. My stitches we healed after 5 days externally and I wasn&#39;t in alot of pain it was very mild even after surgery, and they give u everything u need to clean it and it care for it after cc surgery they walked in on with a huge bag of stuff and a donut to itse that I am still use lol it&#39;s comfortable. Anyway take my review for what it is. Good luck.

Thank you so much! I only recently started seriously looking, so first-hand accounts are invaluable! I&#39;m glad Suporn isn&#39;t the only clinic that uses the urethral mucosa, and that&#39;s actually a *lot* more reasonably priced than I was expecting! Good luck to you too :)

I have a girlfriend who used Canada and needs tons of revisions she has no outer labia definition no inner labia definition and no clitoral hood and honestly it looks like a 2nd booty hole. I would steer far away from that place. A 90 minute surgery is not enough time to do a great job. Mine was 6.5 hours and was done perfect in my opinion. So take that for what it is. I am think results in the USA or Canada are total shit especially the aftercare and it&#39;s subpar in my opinion, I figured if I&#39;m doing this and I have to look at it every day then it&#39;s going to be damn near perfect and I didn&#39;t want multiple revisions. I was wanted to do it once and never touch that area again.
