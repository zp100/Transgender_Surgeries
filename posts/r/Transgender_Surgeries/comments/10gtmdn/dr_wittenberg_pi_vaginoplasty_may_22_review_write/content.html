<p>
I had PI vaginoplasty with Dr. Wittenberg in May of 2022. This reddit was invaluable to me when conducting my research on bottom surgery, and I was hoping to give back with a write up discussing my own experiences! Also, I’ll preface this by saying I’m not a regular reddit user, so apologies in advance if I make any faux pas-es.
</p>
<p>
Leading up to the surgery
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most of my research was done here on reddit, surgeons’ sites, realself, and a little on susans.org (but honestly I visited those sites pretty much exclusively from links from here). I had been doing casual research for a while, but I only seriously started looking into surgeons early 2020.
</li>
<li>
Top picks were Dr. Rachel Bluebond-langner and Dr. Wittenberg. I liked their aesthetics and reviews the most! I had a mild preference for RBL, but ended up going with Wittenberg because her waiting list was roughly two years shorter, and because I live in San Francisco where her office is. Being able to recover in my own apartment greatly reduced the expense, challenge, and discomfort of recovery.
</li>
<li>
Getting letters was not that complicated. I went on psychology today and emailed a dozen therapists, asking if they would be willing to provide a letter in support for bottom surgery in one session. No one promised a single session, but several said something along the lines of “I would only expect it to take a single session”. I went with them! And sure enough I only needed one session with each. All of these appointments were virtual (but it was back when more people cared about the pandemic, so I don’t know if that’s still an option).
<ul>
<li>
I only had the letter from my HRT provider at the time of the consult, but I did let them know I was already in the process of obtaining the other letters. I did have to get my hrt provider letter renewed because the consult to surgery timespan was more than a year. Thankfully the therapists’ letters just squeaked by.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
There was a fair amount of other paperwork required, mostly medical forms, financial agreements, arbitration agreement, etc. They also provided me with a number of pre/post op checklists. I’d be happy to figure out a way to post them if anyone’s curious!
</li>
<li>
I had my consult in May 2021 with Dr. Bonnington. It definitely helped put my mind at ease about the process. Most of the information they gave me was fairly standard: 13 cm depth, labia meeting below the vaginal opening, 1 year before revisions, BMI &lt; 35, no smoking before surgery, etc.
<ul>
<li>
I was surprised by several pieces of information they gave me which differed from what I’ve read online. The parts that stood out most to me were Dr. Bonnington saying that there was nothing meaningful they could do to influence the final aesthetics of any part of the genitalia, besides general requests around size of the labia and clit. He also told me they only had a 4% revision rate. When asked, he argued it was because they give patients realistic expectations for their aesthetic outcomes, and realistic understanding of what cis vulvas look like.
</li>
<li>
With regards to reducing estradiol before the surgery, they require you reduce your dosage to &lt; 2 mg / day for the 6 weeks before the surgery. Presumably those numbers are calibrated for oral / sublingual delivery. I was on 3 mg / week injectable, but they let me keep my regular injection levels because technically I was well under the 2 mg/d threshold. Kinda silly, but I’ll take the win.
<ul>
<li>
If you’re not familiar, the reasoning behind reduced estradiol dosage is that it’s believed to pose an increased risk of blood clots. The degree to which the concerns are legitimate vs overblown is somewhat contested.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I asked them about complication types and rates which I figured I’d post here for reference! I had the first 3, but not any of the ones listed after that.
<ul>
<li>
100%: Sterility, swelling, bruising. Pee will spray. Sexual sensation / orgasm will change.
</li>
<li>
90%: Granulation tissues, which is blood vessel overgrowth. more often inside the vagina. Largely resolved by the 1 year mark.
</li>
<li>
60%: Have parts of the labia detach from swelling. Wound separation. Doesn’t reattach itself.
</li>
<li>
3 - 4%: Vagina scars closed. Complete loss of the vagina. They can do PPT revision if you get PI first, can’t do revisions if you get PPT first.
</li>
<li>
2%: Recto-vagina fistula. Occurs at the time of surgery or within a few weeks. Repair area is very delicate, so we can’t dilate, which results in the vagina scarring closed.
</li>
<li>
&lt; 1% urethra or bladder fistula: Less serious, often heal on their own.
</li>
<li>
(?%) Vaginal stricture: Vagina getting smaller in length or depth. Many potential causes, skin graft not taking, issues with dilation.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
PI vs PPT. I was given the option to have either, although my perception is that Dr. Wittenberg favors PI in situations like mine. I don’t think I have anything novel to add to the debate between the two, but the main factor in me deciding to go with PI was that Dr. Bonnington said they could use the peritoneal tissue for revisions if I went with PI, which they would not be willing / able to do if I went with PPT first.
</li>
<li>
Insurance and medical leave. As it always is, insurance was kinda a colossal pain in the ass.
<ul>
<li>
In calling my insurance company I realized the reps didn’t actually know how to answer questions like “is vaginoplasty covered” or “My doctor requires hair removal before surgery, can I file a claim for that?”, so don’t expect help from them unfortunately.
</li>
<li>
At the start of this process I was on two insurances: My job’s Cigna, and my mother’s BCBS. Dr. Wittenberg was in network for my mothers but not my job’s insurance. Her office said to be covered, though, I’d have to cancel my insurance through my job. This caused some headache with getting insurance switched over to my mom’s with other medical providers, but it wasn’t
<em>
that
</em>
bad.
</li>
<li>
My out of pocket max was $3.5k.
</li>
<li>
The hospital required me to pay half my out of pocket max, then later went and refunded me half of that half. Dr. Wittenberg’s office requested the same amount, then sent me a bill for another $1.5k last month.
</li>
<li>
I’m still getting random bills from random medical organizations for sums between $20 and a few hundred dollars. No idea who they are.
</li>
<li>
It’s a real mess, and I’m fortunate enough to have enough money set aside that the uncertainty wasn’t a huge financial burden for me. All in all I’d say I was charged a net amount of $4-5k. Of course, every insurance is different, and your experience and cost may be pretty different from mine!
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Hour by hour, most of the prep work was in hair removal. I got laser hair removal at the California Skin Institute in San Francisco.
<ul>
<li>
It was mildly painful, but not worse than facial electrolysis. Each session was ~30 minutes of topical anesthetic application / marination, and then ~15 minutes of laser blasting.
</li>
<li>
I spoke with another provider about getting genital electrolysis, but she said it would be very painful, costly, and time consuming and encouraged me to check with Dr. Wittenberg to see if the hair removal I had already done would be sufficient. Dr. Wittenberg’s office confirmed via photograph that the laser alone was enough.
</li>
<li>
I think the hair removal I did was sufficient with regards to aesthetics. My labia minora and vagina are free of hairs. There are a handful of light hairs on the labia majora, especially towards where it meets my original skin at the top, but nothing I find especially bothersome.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I had breast augmentation surgery with Tanya Judge in March. Big fan of her work! Originally they told me to leave 3 months between the surgeries, so I planned for BA in February, but there was an issue in the operating room and we had to reschedule the BA. I was worried I’d have to pick between BA and bottom surgery, but when I explained the situation Dr. Wittenberg said it would be fine to only leave a 2 month gap.
</li>
<li>
I was actually glad I had BA first. It let me chain all my surgeries and get them out of the way. BA also only takes a few weeks to get back up to regular ability, whereas bottom surgery was more like three months, so it was a good trial run.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Week before
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Had my last laser session about a week before. I thought it would be an issue having it so close to the surgery date, but they said it was fine!
</li>
<li>
A few days before I had to go to the hospital to get a PCR covid test. They might not still be doing this.
</li>
<li>
Bowel prep… was no fun… It was like peeing from my butt… Required a more complete clean out than my BA, presumably because they were rearranging stuff down there.
</li>
<li>
My mother flew into town the day or two before the surgery! She was my support person helping me recover.
</li>
<li>
Got all my meds together and was asked to bring them into the final pre-op the day or two before, just to make sure I had all my ducks in a row.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Day of
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drove to the hospital with my mom super duper early, ~5:30a.
</li>
<li>
Checked in, got taken to the prep area, stripped, loaded up on the rolling hospital bed. They had a locker to hold the recovery supplies I brought, my ID, etc. Over the next couple of hours I got checked in on by medical staff from the hospital, the anesthesiologist, Dr. Wittenberg’s nurse Megan (She’s been the MVP of this experience by far, the warmest and most patient person in the office 😭), Dr. Wittenberg, and I thiiiink Dr. Bonnington (It’s been a few months 😅). They let my mom into the prep area to chill with me during that period.
</li>
<li>
They wheeled me into the operating room, and helped me hop up onto the operating platform (super narrow). There was so much hustle and bustle! Like 10 doctors / nurses all rushing around moving things from point A to point B. It felt like a drama where a main character gets shot and all the doctors are rushing around trying to save their life. I tried to count backwards from 100, just for my own curiosity. I think I got to roughly 85 before they knocked me out, and the next thing I knew I was in my hospital room.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hospital stay
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Got strapped up with the fun anti-blood clot leg squeezers. I forget how often they squeezed me, but it was at least a few times a day.
</li>
<li>
I got woken up constantly. You know how meds will say “take every 4 hours for two weeks”? Well, they follow that to the letter, and I was on a dozen different things 😂 I don’t think I got more than 3 consecutive hours of sleep.
</li>
<li>
Dr. Wittenberg’s office sent me a picture of how I looked right at the end of the surgery. I was completely un-swollen at the time, so it actually looked surprisingly presentable, less the giant incision scars and wound vac tube coming out of me.
</li>
<li>
They had me do a lap around the floor on my last day there. It was pretty hard. I met another person who’d gotten the same surgery as me, that was cool 😊
</li>
<li>
My mom got sick so my roommate visited me instead one day instead! Brought me boba. He’s a real one.
</li>
<li>
Played a lot of phone games.
</li>
<li>
Getting the catheter to drain was surprisingly tricky and required playing around with the angle my body + the tube were at. Sometimes I wasn’t sure if I felt like I had to pee because the tube wasn’t draining properly, or because I had a tube shoved inside my bladder. That was true even in later weeks when I was back home.
</li>
<li>
They gave me a fun breathing device (incentive spirometer) that, as far as I can tell, is pretty common for any recovery in which you spend a lot of time horizontal. Essentially, your lungs are doing less work than they’re used to, and they can get inflamed as a result which makes you feverish. The device provides resistance to your breathing so your lungs can get a workout. I was pretty good about it for the first week or two, then kinda trailed off.
</li>
<li>
Discharged after 3 days!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rest of first week
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Felt either nothing, or… tight? Like there was way too much
<em>
stuff
</em>
jammed inside my body. Which, in fairness, is kinda how bottom surgery works 😂
<ul>
<li>
I had a weird “phantom limb” type sensation where I would experience pain in a part of my body that I knew had been moved or removed, but my brain still interpreted it as in the original location.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Sitting, like during the car ride, was very hard. I kinda used my arms to hold myself up. The donut pillow never ended up making sitting more comfortable for me, actually! Different strokes for different folks.
<br>
</li>
<li>
My mom got pretty sick and for a day in there I think I was actually doing more for her than she was for me 😂 luckily she got over it relatively quickly.
<ul>
<li>
Asked my roommate for help with changing my ice packs. You do a lot of changing of ice packs. Get several sets of them.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Watched a lot of tv, played a lot of slay the spire. I didn’t really want anything in my lap, so typing wasn’t as feasible, but moving the mouse was fine.
</li>
<li>
I don’t remember exactly when I had my first poop, but I think it was towards the end of the first week, so don’t stress if it doesn’t happen for a while. You’re supposed to take a pretty steady diet of laxatives to avoid putting strain on the abdominal area while passing anything.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
2nd week
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Switched from couch to bed. I was on the couch because we were quarantining my sick mother in my bedroom.
</li>
<li>
Relied on arms a lot for getting in and out of bed. Pretty taxing on them. Would’ve been in trouble if I had left less time between my BA and this surgery.
<ul>
<li>
Got this big ole costco wedge pillow that was a real lifesaver when it came to sitting up in bed
</li>
<li>
Around here I got the ability to sit up more and thus do more complex tasks on the computer. Not as much energy to do so, though, so some of the creative endeavours I had hoped to pursue while recovering didn’t pan out.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Packing out!
<ul>
<li>
They fill the vaginal canal with gauzey packing to keep it from scaring over. Getting it out wasn’t that bad, really. Weirdest moment was when the very last bit came out, felt like a piece of me had been tugged out. Accurate to describe it as being unzipped.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Started dilating! Kinda painful against the back wall (where the cervix would be if I had one)
<ul>
<li>
The dilation schedule I was provided is as follows. Sessions are 30 minutes long.
<ul>
<li>
Initially: 3 times a day
</li>
<li>
3 months: once a day
</li>
<li>
6 months: every other day
</li>
<li>
9 months: two to three days a week
</li>
<li>
1 year: once a week
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In general, I was told to make my dilation sessions longer if it felt like the dilator was “tight”. I assume this is the sign you aren’t forcing the muscles back well enough.
</li>
<li>
Sometimes I’ve left it in for longer, up to 90 mins, then it starts to get pretty sore
</li>
<li>
Advice wise I’d just say use lots of lube and don’t force things. One of my earlier sessions I was using the wrong angle and it was painful and I got myself all worked up. Upset = muscles tense = harder to dilate. It’s okay to take a break and try again later!
</li>
<li>
It does take a fair amount of pressure to get the dilator in there, and to keep it in place.
</li>
<li>
The dilator didn’t go in super straight at first. I was told that it’s good to keep it mostly straight, but that it wasn’t cause for concern if it wasn’t straight. The swelling inside your body can be uneven, which results in a tilted dilator.
</li>
<li>
I’ve mostly been watching TV or reading while dilating! Holding the dilator takes a hand, and it’s pretty impossible to do from any position besides lying down, so that limits the activities I can do concurrently with it. It’s been a kinda nice way to work through my backlog of shows and keep up with whatever anime is airing that season though!
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I was told to douche for the rest of my life. My research showed surgeons are divided on whether or not this is a good idea. I kept up with it for the first month or so, but have become pretty inconsistent about it. I haven’t noticed any negative effects of my lax schedule.
</li>
<li>
Leading cause of pain was the catheter. Didn’t get that out until the end of the second week.
<ul>
<li>
I had this really horrible sensation of the balloon bouncing inside my bladder whenever I finished peeing. They put me on UTI painkillers that turned my pee orange. I don’t feel like they helped with the pain that much, but I took them just in case.
</li>
<li>
The pain was bad enough that I kinda tried to limit how often I peed, but at the end of the day it’s not really an option. I think it was made worse by the fact that I could anticipate it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
My mom went home after ~2.5 weeks. I definitely missed having her around, both for emotional and practical support! I was able to manage fine on my own, though.
</li>
<li>
I spent a ton of time on discord calls with friends! More than anything, talking to people all day kept me sane. I think I would’ve struggled a lot more mentally if it was just me, my roommate (working most of the day), and the four walls of my bedroom. Watching cheesy disney movies with friends, spending long hours playing rhythm games together, what have you.
<ul>
<li>
My local friends came over a few times too, but it’s a little awkward socializing when you’re lying down and everyone is just sitting around you. I think they were also worried about tiring me out while I recovered. It was still very sweet of them, though!
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One month mark
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sitting in a chair for a few hours becomes feasible. Still couldn’t do a full day of work from the chair for sure. I did a lot of leaning or kinda sitting on one cheek? Not entirely sure why, but it was less painful.
</li>
<li>
Sized up around here. Dr. Wittenberg refused to give any firm suggestions for sizing up dilation, citing a lack of research. She did mention that some patients first sized up around 1 month, so I decided to go for it.
<ul>
<li>
The sizing up technique you’re “supposed” to do is to do a normal dilation session with your current dilator, and then at the end of the session get the next biggest size in as deep as it’ll go. I didn’t really have the patience for that, so I just cold turkey cut over to the bigger size. It was somewhat painful, definitely slower getting it in and out for the first week or so, but after that it felt basically the same as the smaller size.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
For a recovery timeline reference, I didn’t feel comfortable going to an all day music festival at the 4 week mark, but I moved apartments 5 weeks after the surgery and was ok to help pack and carry boxes! I took frequent breaks to lie down.
</li>
<li>
I went back to work at the 6 week mark. Dr. Wittenberg wanted me to go back after 3 months, rather than 6 weeks. There was a little bit of disagreement over it, but her office agreed to sign the medical leave papers for 6 weeks if I signed some documents releasing them from liability for my going back early.
<ul>
<li>
I needed a reduced schedule for the first couple of weeks back. Low energy.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Peeing. This might be a hot take, but peeing is way grosser to me now. I’ve always been a bit of a stickler for cleanliness and I take a bit of psychic damage at the knowledge that I can’t really get all of it off of my body. I’m sure I’ll get used to it eventually :b or maybe i’ll join #teambidet
<ul>
<li>
I was warned that I would get UTIs more frequently now that my urethra is shorter. Iirc Dr. Wittenberg threw out “a few per year”. I have yet to experience one. My mom says she never really gets them, though, so maybe I just have strong genetics?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Today (8 months later)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I had some granulation tissue! Got blasted with silver nitrate, which made the granulation tissue kinda gross and black for a while. The treated tissue on the outside healed up, but I still have some granulation tissue in the vagina. We hit it with silver nitrate again, and I was instructed to dilate with a steroid cream for a month or two. We’ll see how it’s doing at my 9 month appointment.
</li>
<li>
Again for recovery reference, at the 2 month mark I was well enough to travel for a convention spending all day on my feet in relatively uncomfortable cosplay boots. I also averaged like 3 hours of sleep a night and my body didn’t give out, so I’d call that pretty much recovered. I don’t think Wittenberg would be thrilled to hear I did that tho lol
</li>
<li>
I didn’t have success switching from diapers to pads, liners, etc for the first 6+ months. I found they stuck to my labia a bit and pulled at the stitches, to the point of bleeding :(
<ul>
<li>
I used diapers because I still have a significant volume of discharge. It wasn’t huge, but enough to go through cotton underwear. At my last appointment Megan suggested it was in part because of the lingering granulation tissue.
</li>
<li>
I’ve purchased some period underwear which was a relatively effective solution! The purchase was recent, though, so I’m still feeling it out. The underwear is kind of expensive too, like $20 per.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I’ve sized up to the largest dilator!
<ul>
<li>
I’ve only lost ~0.5 cm of depth throughout the healing process. The dilator will go in roughly halfway, and then over the next few minutes things will “loosen up” enough for it to reach my max depth of the last dot. The dilator definitely doesn’t stay at the last dot without pressure.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
My sutures came out pretty gradually over the first few months. They looked like weird pimple-esque bulges under the skin. The only one that bled was one right under a primary incision scar.
</li>
<li>
I was told to avoid being submerged for… 3 months? I forget the exact length of time, because it wasn’t something I planned on doing either way. I haven’t yet gone swimming or even taken a full bath, but maybe someday soon!
</li>
<li>
People talk about post-surgery depression? I never really felt it. I was a little worn emotionally and physically due to the challenge of taking care of myself, but I never got into a slump that felt how depression feels. I’ve also heard people say post-surgery depression can make you regret your choice to get the surgery, and I didn’t feel that either.
</li>
<li>
I presently do not plan to have a revision for aesthetic or functional reasons! Perhaps that will change as I continue to heal, but at the moment I’m happy where I am.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Appearance
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sorry, I don’t plan to share pictures along with this post. It’s hard to describe in words comprehensively, but I’m happy with how it looks! There are specific points I’m happy about (labia minora meeting below the vaginal opening, labia definition), specific gripes I have (a new weird bulge at the top of the perineum), but all in all I’d say it falls comfortably within the fat of the bell curve of all labia out there. Things are a bit asymmetrical! As all people are.
</li>
<li>
The labia majora is more defined than I expected it to be. I think this might be lingering swelling, though. They say it takes a year before your body is totally back to a steady state.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sensation, sexy times
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Defo comfier, before i didn’t even really wanna get totally nakey (#dysphoria hoodie stays on during sex)
</li>
<li>
Still lots of numbness on my labia. It’s somewhat hard to tell when touching it with my own finger, but when someone else touches it I can feel disappointingly little.
<ul>
<li>
There is a sharp sensation boundary on my mons between original and moved skin which is painful to touch with more than light pressure.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I was able to orgasm again at around the five month mark! The wait was not for lack of trying. My sex drive, while not especially high, was about the same as before, and five months is a decent amount of time. For ~3 months the relevant nerves were too numb or painful to interact with productively for more than short periods of time.
<ul>
<li>
I was told that was ahead of schedule, 9 months is their benchmark.
</li>
<li>
Everyone is different, but I found that using toys or having sex with a partner were both too distracting to get in the right headspace. There’s a ton of new sensations, angles, healing pains, etc. What did the trick was a very relaxed experience more similar to what had worked for me pre bottom surgery. Which sounds kinda obvious once I type it out, but :b
</li>
<li>
People talk about your orgasm changing, but honestly mine is pretty similar to how it was before.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Scaring
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Primary incision scars are definitely there, but not as bad as I first envisioned them being.
</li>
<li>
Started applying silicone scar cream, I feel like it’s helping (but also I don’t have a control, so maybe it’s regular natural healing).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Am I happier?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Yes! Loads!! It was definitely the right call.
</li>
<li>
There used to be a bunch of things I wasn’t comfy wearing, like leggings, some shorts, some skirts, etc. Those’re totally chill now!
<ul>
<li>
Wearing just leggings out in public for the first time was wow! Felt very liberating!
</li>
<li>
I haven’t been swimming yet, but I think I would be able to now. I do miss it! I swam competitively before I came out, but I haven’t been in a pool since.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Day to day tucking inconveniences are gone. No uncomfortable itchyness, no awkward / gross resetting a tuck, no stressing about bulges.
</li>
<li>
Sex is less dysphoric. This one is kinda a gimmie, but I feel like I gotta mention it 😂 it was always kinda awkward dancing around certain body parts, deciding exactly which clothes I was comfy removing, etc. Also not an issue anymore!
</li>
<li>
General dysphoria with my body is reduced! I describe the parts of my body that make me dysphoric as sort of “mentally censored”, as though there’s a staticy mosaic blur around them in my head, and although logically I know they’re there, any thoughts about them kinda glance off and are redirected. That was how I felt about my genitalia before! I didn’t want to see it, I didn’t want to think about it. That’s all gone away, though 😊 it’s like getting a piece of myself back!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That about wraps up my thoughts! It’s quite a bit longer than I expected, but I hope the detail is helpful. If you have any questions about any part of the process I’d be happy to answer them!

Thanks for sharing. I’m considering Wittenberg or Min Jun…

Min Jun has a very, very long waitlist. They weren’t even going to see me for a consultation until November
<em>
next year
</em>
. So keep that in mind…

Wow. Thank you so much for the writeup! I’m actually just in the process for scheduling with either Bonnington or Wittenberg. I just got my final letter so we can begin scheduling. This post came just in time for me. A lot of what they told me at the consultation tracks with what your reality has been so far.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure what to hope for in terms of waitlist time; I’m actually afraid to ask. I’m definitely sure I want a PIV. Electrolysis is already coming along nicely for me and I think it’ll be all done by early summer, if I keep going at the rate I have been (about 4 hours/month). Insurance has been a huge headache for coverage of at least
<em>
some part
</em>
of the electrolysis — luckily, my provider
<em>
says
</em>
they’ll cover the surgery, and the electrologist should be able to get them the itemized bill they want. Just so that it can go towards out of pocket maximum if nothing else.
</p>
<p>
One thing that will be much different with my experience is that I’m traveling from the Eastern timezone to get this done. So I’m going to need to find a caretaker (prefer to have a professional—my brother is in the area but not close enough; most of the rest of my family is very unsupportive, sadly). That’s what has me anxious—I’m sure I’ll be able to find something, but I do want to secure it very shortly after I get a surgery date. I’m definitely not looking forward to the flight back—if I have the money I’m seriously considering flying first class just for the return trip, simply because I know they get a little bed thing.
</p>
<p>
While there’s a lot about this I’m not looking forward to, I know in the long run it’ll be worth it. Thanks again for sharing your story!

Thanks for this! Hoping to see Dr. Wittenberg later this year, thanks for the thorough writeup. I&#39;ll need to read this more thoroughly when I have more time!

I&#39;m looking into BA surgeons in the SF area, and Dr Tanya Judge is on my shortlist. Is it ok if I ask you some questions about that? Either here, or dm, whichever works for you!
