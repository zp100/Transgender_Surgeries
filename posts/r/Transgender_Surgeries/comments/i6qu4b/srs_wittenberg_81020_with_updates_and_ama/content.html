I&#39;m just going to keep adding to this as long as I can. I hope it&#39;s helpful for others.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
8/9 13:42 - I just finished my bottle of magnesium citrate, lemon flavored.  Very sour, kinda sweet.  Tastes like rocks too.  Stomach feels warm, tingly.  I know what&#39;s going to happen, just not when or how bad.
</p>
<p>
8/9 15:23 - First bowel movement, was actually three in a row 😒
</p>
<p>
8/9 21:19 - Third trip, probably my last since all I&#39;ve had tonight is coconut water.  Hasn&#39;t been too bad tbh.  Just took dulcolax before bed per Dr instructions.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
8/10 5:23 - Woke up at 5, showered and got dressed.  Slept really well, but super thirsty.  Omfg it&#39;s really happening 😬🌮
</p>
<p>
8/10 13:55 - All done.  Feeling good.  A little yucky from anesthesia.  Blood on my finger, was I that thirsty?
</p>

<p>
8/10 16:07 - Ok, so I&#39;m fine.  I feel tired, no pain.  Just a little like I have a full bladder and something on it.  No complications I was told.  Care team is amazing, great nurses.  Really good view of the city.  Icing still.  Had some apple juice and lip balm.  We&#39;ll eat in an hour or two, try walking after
</p>
<p>
8/10 17:41 - I had nausea and could feel the pain starting.  It&#39;s like having a very hard bowel and having to pee badly, yet you know it&#39;s none of those things.  My pain went to a 5 from a 1 very quickly, and it&#39;s increasing.  Nurse gave medication for both nausea and pain.  Food looked amazing.  I took a tiny bite just to feel food, but was unable to eat.
</p>
<p>
8/10 19:37 - I woke up in pain.  My back, abdomen, and what really feels like a hard dildo stuck up here.  They gave me dilotid.  I feel better, heavy.  No appetite. Hiccups suck
</p>
<p>
8/10 20:12 - they just had me walk for five minutes.  Some pressure hurt.  It was good.  I need some sleep.  I think I can feel it almost to my belly button.  Seriously excited to hear about initial depth
</p>
<hr>
<p>
8/11 4:35 - I&#39;m up.  I can&#39;t really just sleep more than a few hours.  Someone is always going to scream or slam a door, or check my vitals.  That&#39;s not a big deal, it&#39;s very easy to fall asleep.  My pain has been like a 3 most of the night.  I only had one incident where my pain was 8-9, and it&#39;s bc they messed with the catheter and I had to pee, but couldn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
8/11 7:36 - I went for a good walk around the floor.  No pain or dizziness.  I saw Dr Wittenberg and she was very happy about everything.  She said I got 14cm.  A little less than I was hoping, but good.  I&#39;m hopeful that I can eat today.
</p>
<p>
8/11 8:34 - just ate bacon and eggs, little coffee and cranberry juice.  I&#39;m feeling the area a little more.  Besides feeling pressure, I now feel the crackling from nerve repair.  Still at a 3-4.
</p>
<p>
8/11 12:44 - ate lunch, which again was very good for a hospital.  I also walked unassisted for two laps.  Not much pain, and it was good to have longer strides.  I can see the golden gate bridge from my bed now that it&#39;s less overcast.  Pain is 4.  Coffee from nurse&#39;s station is way better than the cafeteria.  I keep thinking it will get more difficult later, but fingers crossed.
</p>
<p>
8/11 16:11 - finished another walk, but this time was harder.  Feeling nauseous and increased pain.  Was given zofran and oxy.  Pain is a 5-6
</p>
<p>
8/11 18:56 - The catheter has become an issue, it&#39;s constantly placed in an area where it won&#39;t drain, causing unnecessary pain.  I slept very hard after my walk, feel much better, and ate fajitas with no tortilla.  A tortilla would have been so yummy.  Pain is down to a 4.
</p>
<p>
8/11 20:25 - sleep, sleep, sleep.  Might try to use the bathroom.  Pain is a 3.  I&#39;m bored.
</p>
<p>
8/12 4:06 - floor has been completely silent, but night shift hasn&#39;t checked on me once.  I&#39;ll go back to bed then.
</p>
<p>
8/12 8:53 - very small breakfast, walking more.  Pain is a 2.  Dr Wittenberg said I could go home today or tomorrow.  It&#39;s a little boring but I&#39;m super comfortable, so idk which to choose
</p>
<p>
8/12 12:53 - this is the best part of my stay so far.  Coffee and a chocolate chip cookie 😋. If you as for coffee when it&#39;s not from the cafeteria, you get nurse coffee, which is way better.  I walked no problem.  I&#39;m in no pain.  Just slight discomfort.  I&#39;m sleeping way more today.
</p>
<p>
8/12 16:51 - I continue to walk and sleep.  I have no pain or swelling.  I&#39;m staying till tomorrow bc I do feel a bit nauseous and the care here has been excellent.  The 180° view of SF, including gg bridge, definitely helps.  My room is the size of a studio, shame I couldn&#39;t have had guests :(
</p>
<p>
8/13 4:02 - I slept most of the night after dinner. The night shift does not check on you, which is disappointing.  I walked again, still no pain unless I&#39;m sitting or bump my catheter.
</p>
<p>
8/13 8:22 - just another hour until I get my last dose of meds, and I&#39;ll check out.  Really, the extended release oxy plus gabapentin has been great.  I say my pain is a 2 but sometimes it&#39;s zero.  Overall, my stay in the hospital, and the whole experience has been excellent.
</p>
<p>
8/13 16:32 - I&#39;m running a decent fever at 101.8. No other symptoms so it&#39;s likely an inflammatory response.  I had my first bowel movement, and the worst part was sitting down.  I wish I had a high chair for the toilet.
</p>
<p>
8/14 5:32 - ok, so without the extended release oxy, I&#39;m feeling more pain.  I woke up feeling more tender in my abdomen, more pressure and some slight burning around the packing.  My stomach is also joining the fun with cramps.  Overall, it&#39;s a 5, so either it clears up or I&#39;ll start crying :&#39;(
</p>
<p>
8/14 15:50 - ok, there&#39;s an amount of pain that meds can&#39;t limit.  I have a constant, low grade fever.  Energy is lower.  Overall it feels like it&#39;s a lot of pressure and a little burning.  I hate it.
</p>
<p>
8/15 6:17 - I swear I have an inflamed bolster stitch, but caretaker says it looks fine, just sensitive.  I was never scared of pooping before, now all I think is contamination.  Pain is still low, but I wish walking was easier.  I don&#39;t do laps, but I do a lot of cooking and cleaning.  Rn I feel like I&#39;m whining a lot, but I&#39;m super happy, actually. I just feel like saying what the worst has been, helps prepare others the most.
</p>
<p>
8/15 17:40 - by far and away, the worst part of all of this  has been pooping post op.  Mostly bc it&#39;s impossible to sit on a toilet without pain.  I&#39;ve been lucky to have gone early, and they&#39;ve been soft.  Bc pressure there hurts.  Clean up is a horrible chore compared to before, and my wet wipes cause the skin around my stitches to burn.  I cry the whole time.  Second worst part is a month without hormones made me lose a cup size :(
</p>
<p>
8/16 7:08 - last night and this morning have been the worst pain so far.  I have lost so much strength, that I can&#39;t get out of bed to ambulate as often.  When I do, the pain is an 8.  And I used to be able to lie back down and feel fine, but no, I was still feeling so many different kinds of pain, and just cried myself to sleep.  I hoped it would be better this morning, but it&#39;s the same thing.  Once my Percocet wears off, it&#39;s over.  I&#39;m only taking one every 8 hours.  It&#39;s a very small dose.  I&#39;m also very concerned with how much blood my bolster has.  It&#39;s purple now.  It always leaks onto my pads, but not my bed.  I&#39;m terrified when they take it off, I&#39;ll just keep bleeding forever

Congratulations!  I have a consult with Wittenberg this week, so I&#39;m really interested in your experience:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Did you have PPT or PI or vulvaplasty, or something else?
</li>
<li>
If PPT, did you consider other surgeons (e.g., Avanessian, Bluebond-Langner, Ting) who also perform peritoneal surgeries?  If so, why did you decide on Wittenberg?
</li>
<li>
What do you wish you had asked at the consult that you didn&#39;t?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks!  And again, congrats!  Feel better soon!

It will be PI.  I thought really hard about PPT, but I can&#39;t see any worthwhile advantages, but some very big complications that are possible.  So many women before me are so satisfied with PI, I had to go with it.
</p>
<p>
I have never considered another surgeon, and I did no other consults.  She&#39;s my favorite surgeon and working with her so far has given me more reasons why.  She&#39;s brilliant, dedicated, and personable.
</p>
<p>
I asked so many questions.  I had a running list and a second consultation to go over PPT and other things.

I’m interested in contacting Wittenberg and I have to ask, what complications with PPT? I’m kinda interested in it for the self lubrication aspect but I’d like to know more. Does she accept insurance btw?

She accepts blue shield, that&#39;s what I have.  The others are listed on her website for mozaic care.
</p>
<p>
To me, extra lubrication was a complication.  So many women need or want lube for sex.  Most don&#39;t need a panty liner every day.  I think the push for having a wet pussy is probably driven from male, misogynistic pressure.  (That&#39;s my feeling, others are free to want lubrication for their own reasons).
</p>
<p>
There are additional scars, I think small dots along the lower abdomen.
</p>
<p>
There are more unknowns, especially around the long term.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I couldn&#39;t see what was so bad about PI to deal with all that.

Yeah I just had my consult, Im going for PPT, I will add that the PA said that it just generally increases stress on the body and makes the surgery couple hours long, which inevitably increase the risk of ALL complications. Also there technically is a risk of intestinal rupture or organ rupture because they&#39;re going into your abdominal cavity (didn&#39;t seem like it has happened before when I was talking to her). I personally am going for the PPT with Wittenberg though, understand how people might not want to deal w all the extra issues among possibly too much lubrication (constant panty liners).

First, thank you so much for answering! I filled out a consultation request right after I posted earlier. I have Anthem Blue Cross through my employer.
</p>
<p>
As follows is my utterly dumb opinion for PI vs PPT. I learned the origin of PI came from plastic surgeons trying their hand at vulva design, while PPT derives from the Davydov procedure developed in Soviet Russia for women born without vulvas. So I felt that I wanted PPT because it seemed to me derived from trying to make cis women whole as opposed to a bunch of rich plastic surgeons making vaginas with no idea what they’re doing. To me, the need to dilate for the rest of my life because the vagina doesn’t properly lubricate to prevent closure seemed like not good enough. And it struck me that PI felt more like it was an afterthought if life long dilation was necessary - cis women don’t need to dilate to keep their vaginas working.
</p>
<p>
I’d like mine to be as close as possible, annoyances and all, to a cis woman’s.

You need to dilate PPT for life.  That&#39;s what Dr Wittenberg has said on her videos on YouTube.  If someone is saying that dilating isn&#39;t necessary, that&#39;s dangerous advice.  Absolutely, lubrication will not prevent closure.
</p>
<p>
Her origin is as a gynecological urologist.  I feel comfortable with her knowledge of cis vaginas, for both vaginal health and aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a preference for what other people choose, you know body best.  But I strongly urge all information used when making your decision to come from doctors.

I’ll look for her videos. Must admit, it’s
<em>
extremely frustrating
</em>
to hear the harping on “doing your research” when literally it’s randomly google and pray you get enough information, which
<em>
simply isn’t good enough
</em>
. I mean, try even evaluating surgeons - do you have all the case data? Can you do the probabilities of who does the best work? Are there objective criteria for their work published?
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I’m happy you’re helping correct my misunderstandings, but please for gods sake recognize there’s literally no comprehensive approach in this topic. Looking at the failures/not good results are useless unless you can gauge it against the successful category to try to figure out your odds.
</p>
<p>
It’s extremely annoying, like mosquito in your ear annoying, because it presupposes a magical threshold for knowledge that not even supposed experts can give a holistic view despite being experts! I’m sorry, it’s just so frustrating to feel like I’ll never get good enough information to make an educated guess and that feels awful

It can be frustrating, especially with the pressure of feeling like it has to be perfect.  And it doesn&#39;t.  There is no perfect vagina.
</p>
<p>
What I would recommend is hearing from your surgeon regarding dilation schedule.  If they say you don&#39;t need to, then do what they say.
</p>
<p>
I personally take losing depth very seriously.  If in a half a year I need to dilate for ten minutes to keep hopefully 7&#34;? That&#39;s an easy decision for me in
</p>
<p>
I think stories like mine and others can only help raise questions to bring to a consult.  Write them down if the organization helps.

There’s unfortunately no alternative to doing your own research and hoping you get it right, apart from blind trust and I’d not reccomended that.
</p>
<p>
Look at photos. It’s the one thing you can judge for yourself.

I’ve seen some incredible results from PI, though. It really depends entirely on the skill of the surgeon. I wouldn’t write it off. And if I had to choose between a well-practiced PI surgeon and a less-practiced PPT surgeon, I would choose PI. Surgeon’s experience is a more critical variable than method, IMO.
</p>
<p>
But, you do need to dilate for life with PPT. I think that peritoneal tissue is slightly more “rigid” and less prone to contraction than skin grafts, so it may make dilation slightly easier - but it definitely doesn’t eliminate the need.

PI is a reliable method, especially when it’s performed by a great surgeon. And Dr. Wittenberg has some incredible aesthetic results with her approach.
</p>
<p>
It’s gonna be great, you’re in good hands! Please keep us updated on how everything goes!!!

Yes it does! I’ve seen Wittenberg result timelines and once the swelling goes down it’s going to look absolutely perfect!
</p>
<p>
I think a lot of people hunting for vaginoplasty results see a photo from week 1 or month 1 of recovery and get spooked because of swelling and stitches. but honestly it takes like 4 months to a year for the swelling to reveal how it will actually look. And your result looks like it’s going to heal beautifully. Congrats!
</p>
<p>
And side note, Wittenberg and Bluebond-Langner are both really good at hiding scars in the groin crease. Your scars are placed in a great position to lessen the visibility.

Oh, I didn&#39;t know people were frightened by earlier post op pics, lol.
</p>
<p>
I chose Wittenberg immediately.  Since my decision, there are quite a few really talented surgeons giving great results too.  And good point about hiding the scar!
</p>
<p>
None made me rethink my choice, tho, lol.

You made a good choice, no doubt!
</p>
<p>
I think early recovery pics are somewhat “gory” by nature (e.g. blood, swelling, stitches), which can scare people. But it takes time to settle and heal. And the people who study other people’s experiences get good practice at seeing how an early post-op result can change DRAMATICALLY between the first few weeks to a year later. And no doubt your result will look better and better as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
Congrats again! I’m super jealous right now 😅 and thank you for the detailed updates. It’s a good resource and we’re thankful!!!

I hope this isn&#39;t an insensitive question, but how did you get a picture so quickly? Did they take it for you from the operating room?

Thanks for the updates!   Sounds like you&#39;re doing about as well as can be expected for the day after.  How long will you be staying at the hospital vs. elsewhere in SF?

If this is as bad as it gets, I&#39;ll be so lucky.  If it heals perfectly? I think I&#39;ll love my vagina more than anything in the world.  Like, guys will have to wash their sticks in holy water, kneel and pray to St Wittenberg, and build an altar from ice packs and dilators before they come inside.

Mine was my good friend.  But she definitely worked her butt off for me, as if it were a job.  Kinda was.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;ll never do it again, lol.  If you need help, there&#39;s housing with help for trans patients but seriously can&#39;t remember the name.
