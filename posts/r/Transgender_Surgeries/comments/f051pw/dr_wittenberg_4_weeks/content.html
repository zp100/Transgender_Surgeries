Can&#39;t speak for OP, but I had surgery with Wittenberg December 10th.  I&#39;m going back to work Tuesday, at 9 weeks, and that&#39;s three weeks ahead of schedule.  At one month I could barely drive the 6 minutes to the grocery store without being in moderate pain from sitting.  The 5 hour flight back to Chicago was brutal, and that was with the percocet I&#39;d saved.  IMO there is no way anyone would be ready to return to work 4 weeks after GRS.  For comparison&#39;s sake I was back at work 14 days after FFS and 3 days after breast augmentation.

I want to get a general idea. I have the summer off and will get 6 weeks to recover before work starts. I have the option for taking sick leave but I really dont want to leave my coworkers hanging of I can avoid it, even if im on light duty

Did you have an orchiectomy before GRS?  I just had my orchy almost 2 weeks ago and now and I feel like having the orchy at the same time as GRS will make GRS recovery just a little bit more of a struggle than having GRS post Orchy.  There was a good level amount of pain above the whole area for me (low abdominal - getting kicked in the nuts feeling for days, and then swelling just behind the pubic hair area from where the cords were cut for over a week - that swelling made any movement hurt pretty bad) and I feel like not having the orchy at the same time when the GRS is done will make that just that much easier.
</p>
<p>
I never had any pain below though, at the surgical site.  That part when perfectly üòä

I didn&#39;t, but my wife is next to me on the couch, and she had an orchie prior to GRS and she doesn&#39;t think it made a difference.

Notes!
</p>
<p>
Reminder this is penile inversion, and I&#39;m 33 years old.
</p>
<p>
I was planning to wait two weeks instead for this next post, but I&#39;m quite happy with how things are starting to look. I&#39;ll post again next week then every two weeks thereafter.
</p>
<p>
I started taking Arnica finally, and I noticed a couple changes. All of my labia are much softer and squishier to the touch now, and my labia minora jiggle cutely when I pat them dry.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also started feeling a bit more sensation down there. I had some pulsing spots of pain randomly and some dull pain from around the staples (the white bits in the photo). In contrast to the new pain I started feeling a bit of pleasure too. There are spots inside my vagina that feel great when inserting/removing the dilator: about an inch or two from the full depth plus right inside the vaginal opening. I&#39;m really looking forward to playing with this in a few more months.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise everything seems to be going as expected. I&#39;m back home now, and perfectly able to roam my own apartment, make food, sit awkwardly, etc.
</p>
<p>
Edit: The icky grey area under the hood is my clitoris. I&#39;ve been hesitant to wash up inside with soap and water beyond just patting it on. That&#39;s all dead skin that should clean right up once I don&#39;t have to worry about damaging anything. Dr. Wittenberg never had any complaints or warnings about it during my post-op visits, so I assume it&#39;s perfectly safe and normal.

Big changes since last week. Definitely looks like the healing is speeding up.

Looks like everything is healing nicely. You mentioned being able to roambyour apartment - what about beyond that?  How long are you able to walk for comfortably, able to go out if needed?

Um. I was able to drive, but I would hate it if I had to do that everyday. My walking distance is still only about 3-4 blocks. Limited by swelling rather than energy.
