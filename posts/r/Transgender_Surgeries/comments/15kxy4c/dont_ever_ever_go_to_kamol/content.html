This is what they say naw about ppv with kamol and they don’t propose ppv like the first option like before and tel that ohhh its the best technique they propose colon because we are to much girls loosing deep and struggling with ppv . they dont want to help us to fix that   They take our money and let us struggling like shit
</p>
<p>
This is haw they answer about information for srs with kamol now :
</p>
<p>
All techniques look the same. PPV is limited to 6 inches. also ppv needs religious dilation or depth can be lost.  Skin graft is good but requires lifetime dilation and isn’t self lubricating or wet. The depth depends on how big your current hardware is to a certain degree. Over 5 inches is typical though.  Skin graft with mucosa is good and is a little moist too. It&#39;s more comfortable and natural but it doesn&#39;t lubricate in the same way as PPV or sigmoid colon. The sigmoid colon with a laparoscope is deepest at 7-9 inches, it&#39;s strong, doesn’t lose depth like other techniques, it can handle rough sex (PPV cant) it self lubricates and it doesn&#39;t smell. The rumour it smells is a rumour and nothing more. I did PPV myself and if I could choose again I&#39;d go for sigmoid colon. Skin graft is also good and a lot cheaper but no lubrication and needs lifetime dilation. The initial risks with colon are slightly higher than ppv but still extremely low. Also the recovery for the colon isn&#39;t so nice. no food or water for 3 days - you will be on IV drip. diet has to start slowly but it all depends on what you want. PPV is good if you date asians as penises are generally smaller. but still the sigmoid colon is better for most people. It doesn&#39;t smell. at all. its a rumour that everyone spreads but it&#39;s untrue

So you&#39;re unhappy with PPV but here you say they propose colon so... I&#39;m confused. Why didn&#39;t you take the colon procedure?

I sometimes hear about disappointments after surgery. Well, just the other day I was thinking about Kamol but let&#39;s just ignore it. So can someone tell me if Yanhee is ok?

Worapon at Yanhee is a younger surgeon and is very promising. Definitely worth consulting, I have met him and he is a really nice man

No problem. Also Yanhee is a very organised hospital and more affordable. They do all have an entire VFS unit. If you visit, stay at the tree Rio condominium, just 2 minutes from the hospital.

I hate where he places the vaginal opening underneath the entire vagina with all his techniques. I’m sorry he did this to you, many surgeons are having to fix his work. So Many girls lose depth and cannot have sex, some have digestive problems also. You’re not alone x

yes this is strange. Kamol patients are the only ones that complain about constipation and need laxatives long term. Maybe he is destroying the pelvic floor structures

I ws shocked a while ago when I asked about Kamol because the website shows plenty of reasonably good imo after results. I was shocked because links to a long list of posts from dissatisfied customers was provided.

What is your dissatisfaction with Kamol? He does a hybrid PPV, and I know other girls who have lost depth and vaginal sex is impossible.
</p>
<p>
FYI, I spent last summer with Kamol having FFS.

sorry if its a bit OT but how did the FFS go?  I&#39;m pre much just choosing between kamol and chett at this point. Both of them don&#39;t really show much result or the results arent really available online (kamol only has sponsored ffs results and chett has almost none).

Below are two links showing the before and after FFS. FYI,  it will be one year this week since I had the last procedure at Kamol.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/zApUWRUl4puZ" rel="nofollow">Before FFS
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/mw9dkUy7Z3e3" rel="nofollow">After FFS
</a>
</p>
<p>
I had three operations, 12 procedures done; basically the entire FFS list.
</p>
<p>
The forehead scar is fine. It&#39;s very thin and hidden by my hair. It was extremely itchy while healing, though.
</p>
<p>
The trachea shave incision is not in the neck fold like it&#39;s supposed to be and is very noticeable to me. It&#39;s a keloid scar. Silicone ointment and tape haven&#39;t done anything to improve it.
</p>
<p>
None of the objectives of the SMAS face-lift and neck lift were achieved. The nasolabial fold is still very noticeable. The corners of my mouth are still frowning, and my jawline is not well defined.
</p>
<p>
The biggest peeves of all is that I have chipmunk cheeks and a thick chin that feels like it&#39;s pulling my mouth downward. I have to dig food out of there when I eat now.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, revisions are in my future.
</p>
<p>
However, to give some credit to Kamol, the 12 procedures I had done would have cost more than $300 thousand in the states. I spent slightly less than $50 thousand at Kamol. I do think I look a little more feminine. He charged me neither for the three revisions nor for the extended stay in his hotel.

Thanks a lot, I was mostly focusing on forehead and potentially a sliding genioplasty and minor contouring if I find the surgeon good enough. though tbf I don&#39;t really put much trust in thai surgeons for that part.

Are depth issues a fairly common thing with that procedure?  Shame though cause from an aesthetics perspective it looks super good.

About 2y post op ppv by kamol, the post op is not good, they don&#39;t advice well, they don&#39;t care about us ! Got only skin left, about 6cm depth, all peritoneal is gone, closed. Just do skin graft in your own countries, hear us sisters. Don&#39;t make the same mistake...
