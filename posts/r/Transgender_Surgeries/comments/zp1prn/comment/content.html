Thanks for sharing!  You look great. I&#39;m just over two weeks post-FFS, so it&#39;s really helpful to see such wonderful long term results.

Congrats! =) Hope you will share your results ^_^
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can clearly see swelling in the area of the chin implant on the &#34;Day 18th&#34; photos, but eventually, it has gone =)

A year ago
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/facemakerffs/">Anna Sluzky
</a>
performed #facialfeminizationsugery surgery and this is my face now :)
</p>
<p>
Before - October 2021, after - December 2022.
</p>
<p>
Bonus: after the 18th day/after the 368th day: January 2022 vs December 2022
</p>
<p>
<strong>
N.B.
</strong>
As requested: prices are there
<a href="https://www.facemakermd.com/services/">https://www.facemakermd.com/services/
</a>
(no hidden fees, just sum up).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I wanted:
</strong>
EVERYTHING!
</p>
<p>
After consultation with Anna, she convinced me that I only need 2 options (and then we added 3rd one).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I had:
</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Frontoplasty and brow arch reshaping $3200 (USD)
</li>
<li>
Upper lip lift $750 (USD)
</li>
<li>
Custom-made individual chin implant $2350 (USD)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
Total: $6300 (USD)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I am going for VFS (FemLAR) in late January 2023 (
<strong>
she is now operating in Yerevan/Armenia
</strong>
).
</p>
<p>
You can find more details in my previous posts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
P.S.
</strong>
No Makeup, No Filters (obviously :)
</p>
<p>
(Except: makeup: eyelashes tint a month ago, and eyebrows tint couple of weeks ago.)

😱 It&#39;s that cheap?;?!?!?!?!? OMG my wife is gonna flip when she hears this. Her facial structure is similar to yours pre-ffs and she is just horribly dysphoric.

<p>
Edit, nevermind.... It&#39;s in Russia. Ain&#39;t nobody going there unless they want to die. War and all that. * Sigh* Back to the drawing board.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic for anyone to go to Russia right now. It just isn&#39;t safe there anymore. I mean Ukraine is currently striking back against Russia. Getting ffs in Russia may mean dodging crossfire.
</p>
<p>
Edit: My wife just said she just might dodge bullets for a chance at ffs. Lol. Yeah she is that desperate, but I can&#39;t blame her. She is 90% German and as such has a masc facial structure.

Being a foreigner in Russia is safe, even now:
<a href="https://youtu.be/0jqngu0GzaQ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/0jqngu0GzaQ
</a>
</p>
<p>
But, again, she is not there. She lives in Israel and operates in Armenia.
</p>
<p>
So, plz, stop being xenophobic.
</p>
<p>
P.S. Will be happy to assist your wife in reaching out to Anna. And share my experience in Armenia.

It is xenophobic to suggest that all the Russian-named surgeons based in Russia support the war and try to kill you pretending there is a cheap FFS.
</p>
<p>
You were the only one who mentioned &#34;Russia&#34; in this thread, ignoring all the details about where Anna lives and operates now, bringing this triggering and painful topic here as a joke, it is not a joke.
</p>
<p>
Ask your wife how all the Germans outside their country felt in 1943..1945 (and after); why you are contributing to the same experience for others?
</p>
<p>
This is how all the Russians outside their ex-homeland feel now. More than four million people left their country (and all their belongings) to protest. (What should happen in your country so four mln people used the only life-non-threatening way to protest like this?)
</p>
<p>
Russians are now a nation without their homeland, and you are continuing to trigger their pain. Not to mention triggering everyone&#39;s pain related to this war: Ukrainians and all the ex&#39;USSR-ppl.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s stop?
</p>
<p>
I will be happy to assist you and your wife, and to share the Armenia experience (how does it feel like to travel to Armenia, with male-passport and female face =)

Please re-read my first comment with the details.
</p>
<p>
1) She left Russia immediately after the war started, as no one in their mind would support that war (and leaving the country - is the only life-non-threatening way of protesting there).
</p>
<p>
2) She is based in Israel and operates in Yerevan/Armenia (and yes, Armenia is NOT Russia), as I have already clearly stated.
</p>
<p>
Please keep these lighthearted &#34;Russian&#34; jokes and discourse away from this thread. As it may be triggering and it is triggering for some people, and it is off-topic.
</p>
<p>
Now, back to the topic.
</p>
<p>
It is not &#34;cheap&#34; but more affordable than US/EU prices.  This is why: medical service is just
<strong>
yet another service
</strong>
there (CIS/ex-USSR) in a very competitive environment.
</p>
<p>
So all the clinics actually compete for clients. (And since it was built on top of developed medical USSR&#39;s culture, there are plenty of them.)
</p>
<p>
So it is just a fair price.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s why people across the world travel there for medical tourism. (and neighbour countries, i.e. Türkiye).

She can operate in Armenia without any pre-requisite because her Russian license is accepted in Armenia. She is working on recognizing her license and experience in Israel, but if she will operate there the price will increase by x factor.
</p>
<p>
(in Ex’USSR medicine and healthcare is just yet another service, so the sphere is very competitive + the cost of living in Israel will be higher + less competition)

I wasn&#39;t joking about anything. I saw the website was a Russian site and the address was in Moscow (on the site) and thought that meant she was in Russia. I never suggested that the doctor would kill the Patient. I suggested that a person traveling to a war torn country could be killed in the crossfire. I&#39;m sorry that Russian history is such a trigger for you. Honestly Jewish history is a big trigger for me (my grandfather was a Holocaust survivor) so I get it.
</p>
<p>
Now when I said cheap I meant affordable, not that the care was not as good. In the US, it is around $30,000 for facial feminization so a difference of $24,000 is significant! I hadn&#39;t heard that Armenia was a great place for medical tourism but it sure sounds like it is with how affordable the prices are.

Yes, sorry for being too sensitive to triggers =) I did not mean to be rude or anything like that. Thank you for understanding ^_^ (And sorry for my stupid jokes =)

<p>
Yes! Until mid-2021, I had US/EU prices in mind and already &#34;gave up&#34; — I thought I would never be able to afford FFS. That is why my mission now — is to be open and transparent and show everyone interested that there are much more affordable options from the top-5 world-class surgeon. (Just check her profile — she has been into reconstructive facial 3d-printing and 3d-modelling since 2005.)
</p>
<p>
But then, in mid-2021, a friend of mine had FFS with Anna — and it was amazing results (she is open, so I believe it is ok to share her results before/after).
</p>
<p>
So by the end of 2021, I had my FFS done ^_^
</p>
<p>
I hope it will work out for your wife as well =)
</p>
<p>
(I hope will be able to share VFS results soon ^_^)

Its entirely up to you ofc ... concerning FFS trying a few optimizations of HRT first, and giving it a few months may be an option,

may be more. Many may not need it.
</p>
<p>
And there is a service called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ucqeo/virtual_ffs_experiences/e93gg97/" rel="nofollow">virtualFFS
</a>
and consulting them in case may be a good idea. They also know surgeons. It may be necessary to discuss with them the kind of approach though. A standard may be a moderate approach. Be aware that with a more aggressive approach results can look more mask like, and less individual.
</p>
<p>
They could make a few suggestions including a minimal one. More details are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/ffs/introduction#wiki_virtual_ffs" rel="nofollow">here

Thank you,

You could find prices in RUB on her .ru site. But I am not sure if these prices are still relevant, it is better to ask her directly (via Instagram).
</p>
<p>
VFS/FemLAR price in USD: $2400.

I love my new voice, but it’s a bit too early to judge (I was told by those who had this surgery not to judge your voice for 2…5 months — it will evolve :)

Daaamn. I&#39;m honestly considering FFS with Anna as well. Just need to finish off my invisalign treatment and then wanna get the FFS done. I though it would be better idea to get my teeth sorted before having something done with my face.
</p>
<p>
May I ask you. How long did you stay in the hotel or wherever you stayed post op? How was the post op care?

Thank you.

How do you feel she did with the orbital rims and how was the actual hospital stay and bedside manner. What about the incision was it at the hairline?

Sorry for all the questions. I’m looking at going with her

Coronal incision (zig-zag to avoid scars visibility), she usually never does the hairline cut -&gt; cause it might be too visible (only in case you will make hairline adjustments + hair transplant later to make it invisible).
</p>
<p>
I am happy with all the orbital rims.
</p>
<p>
Hospital stay was one night: early morning -&gt; surgery, and discharge was the next day around 12:00 noon.

Hello. It&#39;s been a few weeks since I sent her my CT scan, but she still hasn&#39;t told me when she will consult with me. How long did you wait until she consulted with you?

Please note that she has no assistant (she works alone), so the best strategy is to keep her posted/pinged via your communication channel until you have your consultation scheduled.
<br>
Also, in case of no-reply, pls let me know your nickname / account name and the communication channel - I will ping her as well ^_^
<br>
Good luck!

Hello, how did you choose a hotel in Armenia? Is it okay if I stay a little far from the hospital, like a 10-minute taxi ride away? I probably won&#39;t be able to walk after surgery, so I&#39;ll need to take a taxi either way.

I have chosen based on the Hospital Address.
</p>
<p>
It was 2...5 mins walk from the Clinic.
</p>
<p>
And what do you mean &#34;won&#39;t be able to walk&#34;? You will be able to walk home from the hospital the next day =).
</p>
<p>
But Taxi is also OK - it is cheap in Yerevan (Plz use Yandex.GO or
<a href="https://Yandex.TAXI" rel="nofollow">Yandex.TAXI

app).
<br>
Another point - I have booked on
<a href="https://booking.com" rel="nofollow">booking.com

, apartments from
<a href="https://hyurservice.com" rel="nofollow">hyur
</a>
(
<a href="https://hyurservice.com/en" rel="nofollow">https://hyurservice.com/en

Can you explain what is type 1 forehead?
</p>
<p>
Frontoplasty / brow arch reshaping is rebuilding/reassembling your forehead bone (sinus) to for the more flat appearance. Brow arc reshaping - shaving under-eyebrow bones for the same purpose.
</p>
<p>
You can find this explanation: &#34;Forehead and the inscriptions shape changing surgery.

Implements by anterior wall of frontal sinus moving and orbits upper edge and frontal bone remodelling&#34; here:

Basically, if they remove and shave down your frontal sinus before putting it back it’s type 3. If they shave it down from the front it’s type 1. I can’t really work out from Sluzky’s description which it is because it isn’t translated very well

You can subscribe to her Instagram (facemakerffs) — she has some posts explaining how it is performed on 3d models.
</p>
<p>
But, as I just said: she takes out the frontal sinus, cuts it into pieces (as it was already modelled in 3d based on your CT) and reassembles the puzzle as a flat surface, and puts it back, using self-dissolvable threads (her own technique) — so no titanium pieces in your head, just your own bones, reassembled.

I had no breast surgery, just HRT.  But my [cis]-wife had BA with Anna Sluzky (she did it via areolas, so no visible scars. You can check her pricelist:
