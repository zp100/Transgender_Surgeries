I&#39;m trying to limit this sub to trans people only, plus partners and carers with a legitimate interest in surgery.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s some people who treat this as some kind of porn sub, and certain types of posts attract them in quantity. When I look at their post history its full of posts complimenting women on how they look, and all over trans and/or porn subs, and nothing much else. I ban these.
</p>
<p>
Obviously I&#39;m not against trans people complimenting one another, but there&#39;s a gray area where I have to go far back to see that someone might be a partner (or very rarely are trans themselves), and I&#39;m left wondering should I ban them or not? Are they chasers? What are they even doing in a surgery sub?
</p>
<p>
This is a total waste of my time, and I personally prefer the sub have a more serious tone. There&#39;s plenty of other subs where people can post these kinds of things.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking at tightening up rule 5 and being a lot stricter on what people post if they are not trans, or how much time I&#39;m going to spend working out if someone should be posting here. I prefer to ban people and if I make a  mistake let them back in later.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Edit: It&#39;s not solely about about porn and chasers, all cis people will be banned with limited exceptions. Cis people generally have limited understanding of our issues and its much easier to moderate the sub this way.
</em>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also been thinking of adding a plain flair to people I notice are not trans (and not banned). Currently I&#39;ve done this under rule 6 for people with a commercial interest in posting here. Flairs in this sub can only be set by moderators.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone have any opinions on this, or any suggestions about how I should phrase the rule?
</p>
<p>
<em>
Edit: I&#39;m going to experiment with adding the flair &#34;cisgender&#34; to cis people that I don&#39;t ban, white text, green background.
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
Edit: Changed the rules to allow posts by intersex people who have related surgical interests. See
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/khl9fz/we_passed_20k_subscribers_today_lets_talk_about/gglvrib/">here

Edit: Rule 5 currently states
</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>
5.
</strong>
This sub is by and for trans people.
<em>
Partners, carers, etc,
</em>
with a legitimate interest in surgery may post if its of clear benefit to a trans individual or the community.

people who have related surgical interests may post. Do not post otherwise. Others can post on

I too would like this sub have a more serious tone. However, I have absolutely no problem with those who come here out of curiosity as long as their posts are not intentionally offensive. I truly believe that the flow of information allows for better understanding and, possibly, acceptance. There is still was too much transphobia in the world and there needs to be far more normalization. This can only come from the free flow of accurate information. I do believe  this sub would benefit of the removal of chasers, fetishists, and haters along with all the fluff that does not contribute to the  information presented and the ensuing dialog.
</p>
<p>
I do not have any opinions on how to accomplish this and wish you the best of luck in finding the right balance. üíÉüíû

I may be going a bit overboard with this moderating thing as I&#39;m spending quite a lot of time on it and its probably not sustainable if/when I stop. However I like what we have here, it helps people, and I&#39;d like to continue to explore making this community stronger. I&#39;m not entirely sure what I&#39;m doing either, I&#39;ve never done this before, so its a gradual process of learning.
</p>
<p>
So, I agree in principal that we should educate others, its just that I don&#39;t have the mental energy to do it and there&#39;s other subs where that&#39;s part of their mission. It might be argued that I shouldn&#39;t let my personal views influence the sub like this, but to some extent its the price you pay for moderating. No one gets paid for this and its a fair bit of responsibility - if I wasn&#39;t happy with the way the sub worked I&#39;d not be able to continue with it long term.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve looked at other online forums that discuss surgery, including Facebook, and I think this is by far the most informed and useful. We&#39;re doing something right.

I think you are absolutely right about this sub being the most informed and useful online forum discussing trans surgeries. Please do whatever you feel you need to do for yourself and this forum to keep it going. Whether I agree or disagree with your choices, I will support your decisions 100%. This sub is too important to let fall by the wayside. You have been doing great and the most important thing I have to say is Thank you, I truly appreciate what you are doing here! ü•∞‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíÉüíû

I like the idea of having a ‚Äònot trans‚Äô flair, I personally can view the same thing said by a cis person vs a fellow trans person very differently.
</p>
<p>
I think however you tackle this though will be the right move. Like the previous commenters I have absolutely no reason to distrust your judgment.

There&#39;s plenty of trans people who watch porn, post porn, do sex work, drugs, whatever. It&#39;s not my or anyone else&#39;s business. The issue here is typically cis men who come to this sub and treat our posts and discussions as porn.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll typically see a comment saying how beautiful someone is, and if you go back through their post history that&#39;s all there ever is, across multiple trans and porn subs. I think most of us view that as fairly creepy and not something we want to see on our surgery sub, and for those that don&#39;t there&#39;s other subs where that kind of attention is intended.

I&#39;ve banned 10 accounts in the last 1 day.

</p>
<p>
I have to admit, I&#39;ve mulled this over quite a bit since I first read your post. I do see the other side as suggested by
<a href="/u/CesaCyn" rel="nofollow">u/CesaCyn
</a>
concerning the flow of information. Then I reflect on the many people I&#39;ve observed in the course of this life
<em>
who only place value because of the way someone looks
</em>
. Every time they open their mouth, they begin the conversation with a comment about a woman&#39;s looks because that is all that matters to them and it turns my stomach. Have to admit, every time I hear or read these statements, I wonder, &#34;Who the Hell made them God&#39;s Gift . . . ?
</p>
<p>
I support your position to ban them. If for nothing else, the simple reason they do not contribute to the community. Those of us who put ourselves out here in our desire for sharing, learning, education and support, do so at the risk of some level of exposure. While I like to think we are all here for the support of each other, that is apparently not the case and there are those who come here strictly for their personal jollies . . . I would rather see them gone from the sub. If nothing else, I support the Flair idea and concur that by being able to tell the difference between &#34;lookie-loos&#34; and actual members of the community,  I can take in consideration in the value of what they have to say. End of Rant . . .
</p>
<p>
Edit:   &#34;People that only or primarily post compliments on this and other trans subs are likely to be banned.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I suggest changing the wording to read:  &#34;. . . and other trans subs  should expect their access to these subs permanently banned.&#34;

I have a masculine face, but was born as a female and would like to get a feminization surgery for my face, and maybe some body surgeries. Is there a sub that would be better for that?

I‚Äôm confused by this rule and efforts to box people based on how you may identify them. I want to stay up to date in advancements in the science they use for these procedures and the end results. I‚Äôm not fully comfortable discussing why with all my personal details. Yet. I am gender fluid and non binary, I like women, and don‚Äôt tend to self identify to others. I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt fit into a box really. So am I not allowed here?

Hey, thank you for not banning me, I read this post just now, while searching for the wiki again (mobile view is confusing me).
</p>
<p>
Although I&#39;m cis, trans issues are very dear to my heart because of the way I do my job and past students (I&#39;m a singing teacher [no commercial interest, I don&#39;t do online lessons]), and I love to learn about the journey people take, and what it can teach me about my own identity.
</p>
<p>
I also like to think that sometimes people can benefit from a cishet perspective.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, I probably won&#39;t stick around this place for a long time, as my main interest mainly lies with voice training etc., but I&#39;m still interested in hearing more voice surgery examples, and reading about peoples stories.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t stress yourself too much, I think you are doing a great job moderating this community, from what I can tell.
</p>
<p>
If I do anything wrong, let me know, please don&#39;t just ban me, I&#39;m mostly here to learn.

Perhaps, but there&#39;s plenty of others subs. I thought your knowledge of voice might be helpful.
</p>
<p>
I believe lots of voice therapists are against surgery saying training works better and safer.

Yes, I mostly still think that training works better, depending on the teacher/therapist, but I also know, that I don&#39;t know enough surgery results to have a reasonable opinion.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard some really good voice surgery results already , though.

In general not allowed, although a few exceptions have been made on occasion. See Rule 5
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
5. This sub is by and for trans people. Partners, carers, etc, with a legitimate interest in surgery may post if its of clear benefit to a trans individual or the community. Intersex people with related surgical interests may post. Do not post or comment otherwise. Others can post on
<a href="/r/asktransgender" rel="nofollow">r/asktransgender
</a>
. People that only or primarily post compliments on this and other trans subs are likely to be banned.
