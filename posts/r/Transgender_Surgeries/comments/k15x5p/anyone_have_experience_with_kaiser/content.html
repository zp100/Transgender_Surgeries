Generally, it&#39;s easier to get things covered in Norcal, from what I&#39;ve read. Socal seems to be more restrictive. Speaking for Norcal, all forms of top and bottom surgery offered are covered, along with FFS, HRT and hair removal (laser/electrolysis for face and prep for bottom surgery), and voice training.

Hey!
</p>
<p>
Have they been resistant in approving your surgeries? And how long has it taken to get a response from them?
</p>
<p>
Did you have many options when it came to finding doctors to work with, or did you find their coverage limiting?

Hey! First off, I&#39;m a trans woman and thats the basis of my experience, not sure if this applies everywhere.
</p>
<p>
So for getting surgery I think there&#39;s an amount of time to be on HRT that is required, I think its 1-2 years depending on the surgery. Barring that it was fairly easy to get approved. I basically just talked about being dysphoric to 2 therapists, and they approved me pretty easily. The process of getting these therapists was quick (2-3 months) and relatively easy. I had a few appointments with the first and only 1 appointment with the second, to get what I needed.
</p>
<p>
I explained in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/k1g9ju/got_breast_augmentation_from_kaiser_southern_ca/gdpc9lm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" rel="nofollow">this thread
</a>
about the process for getting approved and scheduled for top surgery. For bottom surgery, they approved me quickly (which involved a couple appointments over a week)  but required complete hair removal by electrolysis before they would schedule me. I&#39;m still in that stage. They said it would take 8-10 months but its taken more like 2 years. Apparently they&#39;re still learning too, considering that oversight.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser feels like a one-stop-shop sort of program. That is, they have 1 bottom surgery clinic (its in LA, so quite a drive for me), but they do have a small variety of top surgeons, endocrinologists, and general practitioners. The issue is that to get a different one you might have to go out of your way. The choice aspect never really factored in for me. When I came to this region they assigned me doctors and I&#39;ve stuck with them. Its been fine so far.
</p>
<p>
They do talk about allowing surgeries and trans healthcare for nonbinary folks, but they only seem to give treatments that would be used by a binary trans person of the same assigned gender at birth. So the level of customization IMO is very limited.

Thank you for taking the time to respond!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m Transfem non-binary, but just went by &#34;she/her&#34; in my paperwork because I didn&#39;t want them to take my indifference as a sign of non-commitment.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only interested in bottom/FFS.
</p>
<p>
Not having options bothers me, because it&#39;s a very intimate procedure and I want to make sure I have the option to chose who I want based on their history/results/aesthetics. I&#39;m in LA, and already have my letters, which is good.. but hearing a &#34;one-size-fits-all approach is a little annoying.
</p>
<p>
What have you heard about this clinic in LA? How many doctors do they have to chose from?
</p>
<p>
I just started this job this week, so while I&#39;m not eligible for insurance get, I&#39;m excited to have a general direction to look in.

Good questions. The surgery clinic has 3 surgeons that all work together. That is the only option, to my knowledge, for bottom surgery in Southern CA.
</p>
<p>
They do give the option of zero-depth vaginoplasty alongside full-depth. You might be able to try for a non binary SRS. I haven&#39;t asked about that, but it might be possible.  I would reach out and ask if they do more custom work.
</p>
<p>
The clinic in LA is good though, its shown the highest level of competency in working with trans people, compared to any doctors I&#39;ve had in Kaiser before. It&#39;s their specialty, and they do it ok. Their surgical practice has a really good track record. Very low complication rates, good representation in medical literature, a system for on-boarding new patients, etc.
</p>
<p>
My gripe is that they put on very stringent requirements for getting scheduled for surgery, and don&#39;t put much effort into helping you through them. They need to work on educating and supporting patients, because there was a lot of important info that they never told me (a lot of it pertaining to electrolysis, which is required before bottom surgery),
</p>
<p>
So, you&#39;re more or less on your own for electrolysis (though it is covered by insurance), you have to control BMI and substance stuff too. Looks to me like this is intentionally being used to narrow down the eligible population as to not overwhelm their clinic, which is probably too small to meet the demand otherwise.

I&#39;m non-binary in presenting, with me desiring androgyny. But in sexuality I&#39;m female. So full depth is
<strong>
important
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
I have a BMI of 25 and while I drink alcohol socially, I don&#39;t anything else. So no worries there.
</p>
<p>
Do you mind outlining these other requirements?
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;ve followed the breadcrumbs and have seen another post you were in about a year ago with a lady that mentioned they didn&#39;t have any post-op result photos. While I won&#39;t be helping them with that, it&#39;s worrisome hearing that there is none.. are we just supposed to blindly trust their aesthetics?! Or were you provided with pictures of results?

Yeah, they have no pictures to show. I would honestly volunteer pictures of mine if it meant they could show people. It makes a difference. They recommended I look on transbucket, but I haven&#39;t been able to get that site to work on my computer ever. Maybe there are some posted there. They do also have a couple medical papers where they detail the procedure they use, so if those kinds of specifics are important to you I can give more info for that.
</p>
<p>
I did do some research and learned that their technique is similar to the OSU and Northern CA Kaiser practices, so you can look up their practices and see some after pictures. But yeah, not much to go off of.
</p>
<p>
The requirements beyond BMI and ending all substance use is of course the year of hormones, the hair removal, the 2 letters from therapists, attending a class + a consult at their LA site. As for electrolysis, you have to stop and wait a month and they do whats called a &#34;hair check&#34; - and if you have few enough hairs they&#39;ll schedule you.
</p>
<p>
They also expect you to line up rides and a stable place to stay, to certify your finances are in order. Basically guaranteeing you&#39;ll be taken care of. The issue with that is that they require these without even giving you a surgery date. So its like, sure I can find a driver and a caretaker, but
<em>
when?
</em>
</p>
<p>
I also think they will de-prioritize you if you have a &#34;bad attitude&#34;, etc. I had a friend going through who self-medicated depression, pain and anxiety with weed, and they got really mad at her when she told them she didn&#39;t want to stop. Totally lacking understanding, gatekeeping stuff. I&#39;m not trying to make them sound evil, they&#39;re definitely one of the most advanced trans healthcare programs, but they&#39;ve got a lot of work to do to make it actually trans friendly.

I&#39;m trying to contain myself, but hearing that
<strong>
really
</strong>
upsets me. What
<em>
other
</em>
people do with a similar technique/method says nothing about their competence/ability/skill level and results. To me, not having
<em>
any
</em>
pictures whatsoever is
<em>
not
</em>
a good sign. I feel uncomfortable taking
<em>
any
</em>
type of photo, so I understand why many people haven&#39;t.. but the fact that there is absolutely
<em>
nothing
</em>
to show? That&#39;s just crazy. Simply crazy! No one is ever expected to blindly buy a home, a car, or anything else that&#39;s extremely expensive/valuable/permanent and life altering. This just tells me they&#39;re preying on the fact that their clients often have no other options. The woman also mentioned that if there was any bad news, we&#39;d have heard about it.. that&#39;s simply not true. That&#39;s invalidating the fact that things like Medical NDA&#39;s exist. Medical NDA&#39;s should not even be a concept! If someone botches or butchers you, you should have the full right to warn others. The apparent
<em>
lack
</em>
of negative reviews shouldn&#39;t be taken as a sign of no negative experiences.. that&#39;s lazy thinking. And if their pre-surgery treatment is any indication of their actual practices, then well.. I just–I failed to contain myself.
</p>
<p>
You mentioned &#34;attending a class&#34; as a requirement? What &#34;type&#34; of class? And how do they perform this hair check?
</p>
<p>
How do they verify your rides, place of stay, or finances?
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t have a bad attitude, due to the vulnerability required during this experience and retaliatory human nature. But I would acquiesce with anything suggested/required for my health and optimal recovery. Them getting &#39;mad&#39; is
<em>
highly
</em>
unprofessional. A simple, &#34;These are our requirements to proceed,&#34; is all that&#39;s truly necessary.

FWIW I haven’t been asked to sign an NDA.
</p>
<p>
The class was like an hour long lecture on the prep, recovery, possible complications, scheduling details, etc. stuff they should really put online
</p>
<p>
They don’t verify ride or income. They do ask but I don’t think there’s any follow up. In retrospect I would have just told them “yeah I’m good” instead of complaining to them how unreasonable it is to ask us to have that lined up so far in advance.
</p>
<p>
The hair check is an exam where they closely look at the area, probably feel it for hairs too. I doubt it would take super long but I haven’t had it yet.
</p>
<p>
I agree 100% it could and should be a lot better. I’m gonna make some formal suggestions after I get bottom surgery.

When is your surgery?
</p>
<p>
What will you writing formal suggestions really matter to them after you&#39;re in and out of their door and they already have your money?
</p>
<p>
And I thank you again for detailing this information.
