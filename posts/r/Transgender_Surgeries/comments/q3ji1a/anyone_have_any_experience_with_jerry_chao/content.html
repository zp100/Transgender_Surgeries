I have met with Dr Chao and he seems like he knows what he’s doing and is plenty capable. Truthfully in the area I’ve been more impressed with results from Dr Ramineni in DC or Del Corral in Baltimore.
</p>
<p>
I will say that while Dr Chao is very qualified, and very nice and thorough in person, his front office absolutely screwed me out of surgery any time in the immediate future. My insurance had denied FFS, like they do, but I called them and badgered them until they agreed to a peer to peer consult which is a genuine chance to get things picked up. They gave me a phone number to give to the surgeon’s office, which I did, and when I hadn’t heard anything for a few months I called Dr Chao’s office back and they just hadn’t call my insurance. The clock ran out on the peer to peer and my insurance refuses to schedule another one. Dr Chao’s office just balled that number up and threw it away and now I have no shot to get FFS covered.

That&#39;s great to know. I&#39;ve had a run in with Del Corral and personally wouldn&#39;t recommend him. His consults are vague and refuses to do anything that insurance won&#39;t cover at the same time with something insurance will cover, which just adds months and additional trauma to me, and for what? because he does&#39;t want to file paperwork a certain way? gtfo
