Dr. Christine Mcginn in Pennsylvania. She is one of the best vaginoplasty surgeons in the country and a trans woman herself. She was originally my first pick for myself, but the logistics of getting there and back won&#39;t work out for me.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Devin Obrien-Coons in Boston is ultimately who I am going with. He has a great reputation also.

Dr. O&#39;Brien coon was the one botched me here at Hopkins back in  2017. He did 5 failed revisions. I finally got fix by Dr. Ramineni he is in DC. Going to Dr. O&#39;Brien was a nightmare I&#39;ll never forget until the day I die. Thanks to doctor Ramineni i got my life back

Not an issue at all! I’m here to answer any questions people may have. I can pee perfectly fine, but I have absolutely no vaginal canal so I am not able to have vaginal sex.

First off, peritoneal vaginoplasty is not particularly new, it&#39;s been preformed on cis women since the late sixties (sometimes called the davydov procedure).  Its use on trans women is newer, but it&#39;s pretty well tested at this point.
</p>
<p>
The wait times are fairly long at NYU, but nowhere near as bad as 2029 (at least for first time vaginoplasties, idk about revisions).  I had surgery there recently, and my total wait time from first contact was about 18 months.  Drs. Bluebond and Zhao are great, and certainly worth contacting.
</p>
<p>
I would also look into Mozaic Care in San Francisco and Mt. Sinai in NYC as well Min Jun and Geolani Dy who trained at NYU.

After reading a few comments I requested a consultation at NYU, and they just called and left me a voicemail, letting me know that I wouldn’t be able to receive a consultation until 2028. They also made sure to reemphasize the fact that that was only a consultation, and that my surgery would most likely not be until at least a year after, so unfortunately it’s true.
</p>
<p>
But thank you for the other recommendations (:

It looks fantastic. I&#39;d still recommend colon because it has a lower failure rate than the peritoneal.

My issue with the colon is the chance that there is a really foul smell coming from the vagina, and my surgeon highly recommended against that, and said that he has had multiple patients come to him for revisions due to that exact complication. I’ve heard the possibility is extremely high

I had originally Scrotal PI from Kamol , went to Theerapong last fall 2022 for Sigmoid Colon , originally with Kamol I chose Scrotal PI because I thought the same thing of a smell for ever but 10 months after ( only a little 1 st 6 weeks ) post op Sigmoid and it’s not an issue of smell once it’s in it’s new environment as a vaginal canal and not have bacterial feces running through it anymore ! - I just take the extended shower head spray after dilation during a shower and with warm spray up inside warm water only and have “ 0 “ smell - it changes , I have no dirty smell post op - somewhat of a myth about Sigmoid Colon ! Your doctor/surgeon probably doesn’t have the experience to do this technique - it was an 11 hour surgery with blood transfusion for me in Bangkok , works well and is not smelly if cleaned out properly after dilation etc.

As far as I know, Dr. Gabriel Del Corral out of Washington, D.C. does PPV and is very good at revisions. Quite a few positive reviews and much shorter wait times. Expect to wait 5-6 months for a consultation and maybe another 8 months to surgery. Best of luck! Nicole

Seems wild that NYU has a several-year wait list. My girlfriend has hers lined up for later this month and it took her a year from consult to surgery date and that was after it got pushed back a month and a half due to some unexpected issue come up with the doctor.
</p>
<p>
I echo the idea to check around other nyc hospitals. We have a lot of GCS surgeons here.

New York by far has the most progressive gender-affirming healthcare in the world. Was your girlfriend scheduled for a revision procedure?
</p>
<p>
NYU prioritises primary surgeries over revision surgeries.

Check Mt Sinai, in particular Dr Rajveer Purohit. Took care of 2 of my friends and they are very happy with their results. The last friend had her surgery March of this year and her consultation was a year prior.
