I cannot say enough about how much I love Dr. Hanna! I feel like he doesn’t get the attention and accreditation for his work that he deserves… This man has forever changed my life, and I am so glad that I ignored all of the naysayers on Reddit just because he did his fellowship with Dr. Rumer..
</p>
<p>
I am so happy that I decided to have a consultation and let him and his work speak for itself because in just one visit he had already instilled so much confidence in his abilities in me.
</p>
<p>
I always look forward to our follow ups! He has the best bedside manner and I never leave his office with questions nor do I feel like any of my questions are met with irritation or impatience.
</p>
<p>
My stay at Carrollton Regional Hospitals was nothing short of phenomenal. I loved that the staff was very diverse, and they never treated me like my care was a burden. I did have a negative reaction to one of the narcotic pain meds which caused me to vomit for much of my second night in the hospital. The following day on Dr. Hanna’s daily visit he checked my dressings and my packing for my vaginal canal to which he said he felt like my packing was maybe a little bit more loose than he would like. I was impressed that in the moment he had decided that he would add a bit more packing and suture it in place to preserve the integrity of my depth and vaginal opening. It was that type of attention to detail, proactiveness, and care that had originally drawn me to Dr. Hanna to begin with, so it was nice to see it in action.
</p>
<p>
Don’t even get me started on how much I love his entire staff! I feel like I have gained a family in Nadia, Desi and Paige! I loved that when Dr. Hanna was giving me lidocaine before suturing in some more packing Desi was rubbing my shoulder to help soothe me. She also did at one of my visits where he removed my catheter… Paige and Nadia visited me multiple times in the hospital and were a welcome, uplifting energy. They made sure that I stayed in good spirits and celebrated this momentous occasion right along with me. The candy that Dr. Hanna and Nadia brought me wasn’t too bad either 😉
</p>
<p>
I can go on and on and on and on and on… but I won’t! If you are looking for a surgeon that is going to involve you in every step of the process of stepping into your own skin you need not look any further. If you want to get to know him and all the good he has been doing for our community and support someone who truly loves us go follow his TikTok and consult with him. Try to get in before he has a five-year waitlist like half of these other surgeons… You won’t find a better one!
</p>
<p>
Sincerely, a Hanna Girl

Have you??? No one has a butthole where you’re claiming to be confused by my vaginal opening. I👏🏼AM👏🏼3👏🏼 MONTHS👏🏼 POST👏🏼OP! I am still swollen… in your own words.. Follow my clit down to the second hole that’s called a U-R-E-T-H-R-A and just below that is my vagina opening. Which AGAIN has recently been treated for granulation and is still swollen.

It wasn’t  a member of the trans community, but someone going around spewing anti trans hate on reddit. Reddit is full of them.

Also, quick question… I noticed you had another comment that said “I’ve always wondered where the actual vagina is” and on your profile you’ve got a post looking for lesbians.. do you mind clarifying… are you Trans? (Obviously I know Trans women can be lesbian) Because if not, you certainly have no business on this thread making comments like this. No vagina/vulva looks exactly the same and to imply that my vagina looks so “confusing” seems intentionally hateful… I think my vagina looks great and is in no way “confusing” I love her.

Must say I think it’s disgusting that you would take the time to tell me you don’t like the aesthetics of another persons vagina… gross. You only have one set of labia “minora” so your statement makes zero sense. Also how dare you attack someone’s body and try to tear down the positivity they feel about their body. 👋🏼 Work on yourself… not breaking down others💋
