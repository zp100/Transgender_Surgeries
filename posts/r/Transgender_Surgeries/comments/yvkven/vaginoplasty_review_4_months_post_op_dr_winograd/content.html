<p>
I am several months out from my surgery with Winograd and have already experienced some pretty good results although the one caveat is that long term results are well ... longer than &#34;a few months.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I did note that there aren&#39;t a lot of reviews - neither positive nor negative, despite the fact that he does 2~3 surgeries per month for at least 5 years? That surprised me, I went in with a lot of questions but felt good and that the idea of staying local, given my family life, was the right choice. A lack of negative reviews despite some significant searching meant I didn&#39;t feel like i was heading in to get &#34;butchered.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Overall I feel well taken care of and am feeling quite positive. It&#39;s too early to say for all results but here&#39;s what I&#39;ve experienced so far :
</p>
<p>
This was a more or less typical penile inversion technique. I did have questions about peri(spelling help me) pull through techniques and he explained why he doesn&#39;t do those yet during my initial consults.
</p>
<p>
I can tell that I haven&#39;t regained 100% sensation but my nerves feel like they&#39;re in good shape and well, I&#39;ve already been able to experience orgasms both through clitoral and vaginal stimulation (fingers/toys that are smaller than my dilators.) But I still feel marginally &#34;dulled&#34; - given my experience with other scarred areas on my own body it&#39;ll be a fair bit longer before I feel totally normal in that respect. So overall, I&#39;m pleased and am fairly certain it will get even better in the future. (also im like 200% more horny now than I ever was pre op holy shit realizing how much dysphoria dragged us down.)
</p>
<p>
Dilation wise, I also feel pretty good. I wasn&#39;t especially &#34;well endowed&#34; and had on many years of HRT before even going in to my consult that caused my bits had shrunk somewhat. Even so, I&#39;m able to bury the third dot on soul source dilators entirely inside myself, and I&#39;ve worked my way up to the green one, although it still feels like a but of a stretch ;&gt;
</p>
<p>
External appearance idk I feel too biased but I&#39;m really happy with how things look? I&#39;ve had several &#34;holy shit I&#39;m so happy&#34; moments about my body so far, even early in when I otherwise felt like garbage physically.
</p>
<p>
Caveats - Dr Winograd doesn&#39;t cauterize follicles so you should be thorough on hair removal prior. I spent about a year working on this, starting even before having selected a surgeon, using mostly laser hair removal with some electrolysis to handle what was left after ~10 sessions; my age, which starts with a &#34;4,&#34; meant that there were some greys that the laser won&#39;t touch. Even so, on imaging (with a camera inside my bits at around month 4 for reasons below) I could see some sparse, fine hairs (noting that the camera magnified it significantly). But I can&#39;t feel them with my fingers at all, inside myself.
</p>
<p>
I did have a complication involving a urethral stricture which formed about 2 months post op. A bubble of granulation tissue formed at around 6 weeks , and refused to respond sufficiently to silver nitrate treatments, so it required a revision. The worst part about that is the timing - 2 months is too early to start a new revision, but it had seemed alright for the first several weeks during which I had been able to pee normally.
</p>
<p>
I had to wait another 8 weeks for the revision, maintaining a catheter the whole time, and I was super stressed. However now that&#39;s done and I&#39;m surprised at how quickly after that I started feeling better, both mentally and physically.

Isn&#39;t it amazing how the reduction of dysphoria opens up life? I hadn&#39;t expected it. Good luck with your recovery.

Thanks for the review! Dr Winograd is doing my surgery in the very near future and you just don’t see anything about him, good OR bad.

Appreciate this review!! I’m a trans man and just had my phalloplasty with MGH 2 weeks ago, their team is extremely skilled, i’m surprised more folks don’t choose to stay local / choose to have access to such a large multi-disciplinary team. Glad to hear things are going well for the vaginoplasty patients too!!

Is it possible for me to see photos of your results? I’m supposed to go with Bluebond but she doesn’t take my new insurance so I need to go with a Boston surgeon now. Winograd is already set to do my top surgery so I’m curious if I should use him for bottom too. I wish there were more pictures of his work. And when you say his technique is “more or less typical PI” what do you mean? Does it differ in some way than the standard? One thing I like that Bluebond told me is that she doesn’t cut any nerves she just separates the glans and folds it into its new placement so there is no nerve damage——- do you know if Winograd does the same thing?

I&#39;m not willing to share, sorry.

And I don&#39;t remember, though that kind of procedure specific question was among the thousands of questions I asked in my consult.

Okay. Did he show you any photos of his work at your consultation? It feels so scary not knowing much about his capabilities

I&#39;m searching for in network locations/surgeons and Dr Winograd so far is looking like whom I&#39;m going with.  Do you mind if I pm you as well? Information about his results are few and far between. I haven&#39;t seen any picture results on his work either.  I&#39;m looking at going with sigmoid colon vaginoplasty with him and possibly top surgery depending on how things go.

Does he do sigmoid techniques? That wasn&#39;t an option for me.

I messaged the center off the website and was told that it is as well as PIV.  When I asked for the Dr. was that would do sigmoid and they came back with Dr Winograd.

I would certainly ask directly to Dr. Winograd, but in my original consultation I asked about if he did any alternate techniques besides PIV and he said no (or more specifically, &#34;not at this time&#34;) , and we had a lengthy conversation about the different techniques and why he continues to use PIV techniques.
