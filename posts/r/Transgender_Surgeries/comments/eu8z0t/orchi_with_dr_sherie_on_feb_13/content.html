Im very excited! Having Orchi and Scrotectomy with Dr. Sherie in Charlotte on Feb 13. Hoping for the best!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m wondering .. if you have had orchi would you mind sharing your post-op experiences regarding feminization and hormones?

Hey! I had mine 6 months ago, and am definitely happy with the results! Physically, I ended up gaining a few pounds/became much harder to control my appetite, which worked out nicely for breast development/curves as a whole, and my face definitely got a little softer as well. It&#39;s tough to tell what&#39;s just fat redistribution from the weight gain and what&#39;s truly changing underneath, though. I had also recently gone on progesterone about 9 months ago, so some of that could have also been related to that.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally, the benefits were a little bit more stability - I&#39;m no longer feeling quite as burned out in between doses of hormones, so I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s the lack of testosterone rising at the end of the day which has been most helpful. I&#39;m on sublingual estradiol &amp; micronized progesterone, so your results may vary if you are doing injections instead.

I found that post-orchi, my T levels nosedived. Pre -orchi, as a result of HRT, they were  at cis female levels.
<br>
As a consequence  of surgery, with almost zero T, I became very flat in mood. I assumed this might just be my body recalibrating, and I hoped my adrenal glands would begin to make a bit more T to compensate. But it didn&#39;t happen, so now I apply small amounts of testosterone gel to bring my T levels back up to cis-female range.
</p>
<p>
Will  you going for a total removal of the scrotum,  or are you just having the &#39;bagginess&#39; removed?

Congrats girl! I’m having my orchiectomy surgery in a week. Early Monday morning February 3rd to be exact. I’m excited too. Also non op grs/srs by choice. Can’t wait to go off t blockers &amp; hope my estrogen levels get high. They’re low even at 17 months hrt. Hopefully more feminization occurs too. Good luck!
