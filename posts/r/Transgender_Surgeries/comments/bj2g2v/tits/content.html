I&#39;m at 10 months of HRT and yesterday I&#39;ve had a breast augmentation in Kaunas, Lithuania.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now back in the hotel, and I got the whole week off from work to rest.
</p>
<p>
My chest doesn&#39;t hurt nearly as much as expected.  It&#39;s healing nicely.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll have to wear a compression bra for two months.
</p>
<p>
And here&#39;s some pics/videos:

Who did you get your hrt from ? Because im two years on hrt and still and growing in chest. Its recommended to gake hrt for two years before getting implants because if growth forms under and around it will make them look bad.

I have a few questions.
</p>
<p>
Who is the surgeon? Would you reccomend your surgeon to others?
</p>
<p>
What did it cost?
</p>
<p>
Was there any reccomendation to wait until you&#39;d been on hrt longer?
</p>
<p>
Why Lithuania?
</p>

The surgeon is Dr. Darius Bagdanavicius.  He was very friendly, competent and professional.  Yes I would recommend him :)
</p>
<p>
I went to Lithuania because with Wellness Travels it costed 3000 euros including everything, which is not too bad, about half of what it costs in the UK.
</p>
<p>
I did it now rather than later because I was being miserable, and a friend of mine helped me pay.
