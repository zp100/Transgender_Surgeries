I choose to believe the people who actually had surgeries with Chett, Suporn and Kamol. I have no idea why so many people would lie about being happy and pleased with their results on the internet.
</p>
<p>
In my years of research I have never have read so many negativity towards those surgeons (sans Kamol, you don&#39;t actually read much at all about him, it is usually Suporn and Chett). It just seems a little off to me. Bad results can happen regardless of surgeons, but if the bad results were the majority I doubt those surgeons would have the reputation they currently have.
</p>
<p>
In the end, it is up to you to make your choices, and accept the consequences - Whether they are good or bad ones.

Its the same with all this stuff. You normally can&#39;t look at posts in isolation, you have to look at the number of positive vs. negative posts and the credibility of what&#39;s written. If you simply went off complaints you&#39;d either not be having surgery or having it with very inexperienced surgeons.

Well I’ve actually had a consultation for FFS with Chetthawut. He was really nice to me and cared a lot. But he did say about me not passing without doing forehead which might’ve been harsh to hear but probably true? Idrk. He also talked about another patient of his who had FFS but used he/him pronouns misgendering her, but corrected himself after. But overall apart from not passing comment, he was nice, used my preferred name and everything.

I hadn&#39;t heard of Dr Kamol before this thread so googled. From him website...
</p>
<p>
Dr.Kamol performs more than 2,000 male to female sex reassignment surgeries each year. Since 1997, he has performed ... over 5,000 sex reassignment surgeries (SRS).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Umh, math is not my strong point but... a lot per day but not that many over more than 20 years...

I&#39;m a bit late to this thread but I noticed the 2k a year too and emailed and asked them about it!
</p>
<p>
The response I got was &#34;Actually Dr. Kamol performs several procedures per day, not just SRS, some procedures take only 1 hour or less so 5 cases it is still normal for him.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I still think 5 surgeries a day is an ambitious answer but I guess it&#39;s not totally unrealistic if a lot of them are shorter

It’s important to remember every surgeon has good and bad reviews, and for surgeons like Suporn and Chettawut who have performed thousands of surgeries, there’s bound to be unhappy patients and situations where they’ve committed mistakes.  Proper research, taking time to weigh pros and cons, and talking to as many patients as possible is the best thing you can do.
</p>
<p>
Suporn is not a perfect surgeon, and I’m not sure why people defend him so heavily - or any surgeon for that matter. Sure, he’s done a lot of great for the medical community and has developed techniques that are revolutionary but he’s also hurt a lot of people. However, that’s really not unique to him and that’s important to remember!  If you search the wiki there’s plenty of Thai, American, and Canadian surgeons collectively with a plethora of negative reviews. Again, it’s for you to weigh the good and bad and to decide what’s best for yourself - surgeons are human, not gods, and again mistakes will happen!  These surgeries no matter the technique
<strong>
are highly risky and complicated
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
What I find disturbing is that every few months a handful Suporn girls will post that 1.) They’ve experienced nerve damage or clitoral necrosis to the point where it’s died and literally fell off of their body. 2.) An overwhelming amount of girls have to travel back to his clinic in Thailand for a revision for function or aesthetic, sometimes multiple.  I find the first point to be completely unacceptable - however they’re not the majority to my knowledge.  Usually these experiences that are shared are shortly posted before they’re deleted out of shame or embarrassment, so it’s impossible to provide a source.  It’s also important to remember it’s impossible to know every outcome of patients, their personal feelings towards it, variables they were dealing with beforehand, and how their healing took place.  Proceed carefully, do research, ask important questions.
</p>
<p>
besides, the questions wasn’t directed towards Suporn but the Thai technique in general and why some consider it better - it’s really a matter of personal opinion and YMMV (your mileage may vary).  Thai surgeons perform NPI (non penile inversion) and North American surgeons perform variations of PI (penile inversion), though surgeons
<em>
rarely
</em>
perform traditional PI anymore.  NPI vs PI uses different parts of anatomy within surgery, yielding different benefits towards the end results. Often times people claim the aesthetics from NPI technique yield better aesthetic results whereas some claim the PI technique yields better functional results, however both produce beautiful results aesthetically and functionally in modern times - it’s all anecdotal and a matter of personal opinion, YMMV with healing and any technique.

There&#39;s lots of info on Thai surgeons here

Have a look at the photos of results.

People usually mean Suporn Clinic and Chettawut when referring to the Thai technique.

My only personal reference to Thailand is don&#39;t go to Dr Suporn. Regarding Dr Chettawut ive heard issues of his practice as well . Ive heard of many patients where he also removed there  Nerve from the clitorial &amp; he  follows  dr suporn.! Dr Saran as well as  Dr Sarin also  follow same suit.
</p>
<p>
I have had many  personal conferences and have  exchanged information regarding full SRS/GRS constructions with many of the worlds top surgeons. The only one that could repair me was Dr Kamol in Thailand . I have seen many girls go in there and many come out sometimes with small differences .due to body structure and ethnicity. All  were happy and not botched the way i was at the Suporn clinic .

It goes a lot further than Suporn or Chet... Let’s go back to the beginning where the SRS technique began with Dr Preecha . From there his technique was thought to a few surgeons dr Suporn , dr Chettawut Dr Kamol and a few others . It’s said that it’s done better since these surgeons have been doing these surgeries for a long time . Each surgeon has refined there technique some do it better than others .
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately we don’t hear the truths of many of these surgeons since it’s Thailand and many don’t hear the horror stories. Yes there has been many good surgeries come out of Thailand but we don’t hear about the bad ones . They are easily hid from the news and the public .
</p>
<p>
When I researched for a long time on where to have my surgery I found out about the truths. From meeting with past patients to friends or family members of those who had good surgeries and those who did not .
</p>
<p>
Dr Kamol is one of the best rated surgeons since no one has died by his hands . That is why I had my surgery with him due to his good reviews, his ethics and successful surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Dr Suporn was on my list of surgeons until I found out about the truths. His mismanagement of his clinic. The many botched surgeries by the old trick of surgeon switching once you are under anesthesia. Dr Suporns different SRS procédures where he decided to experiment on many patients trying to refine his technique. Knowing he could get away with it . Due to this many have received inappropriate botched surgeries. To which extent some have to live unhappy with what they received and worse those who died or ended up taking there lives . His lifetime guarantee is now void since he retired!!! Many are unhappy and many more have had to have revisional surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I saw a very close friend through her many surgeries to rectify herself. Due to many serious mistakes made at The Suporn clinic .  To list a few :  1. Surgeon switching during her initial surgery. 2. Resulting in miss communication during her surgery and lack of experience. 3. Urology re-routing that caused Sepsis (toxicity) 4. Érectile tissue being left when it needed to be removed as well as part of the core of the penis .  5. Nerves in her thighs were cut and severed causing her to not be able to walk and massive pain and suffering . 6. Main sensate nerve being severed from the clitoris resulting in no sensation.  7. Unethical treatment from surgeons nurses and staff.  8. This patient had to have so many surgeries to try to fix the damage unfortunately every time she had to return to the Suporn clinic where they tried but could never repair the damage caused.  9. Suporn trying an experimental technique of joining the labia minors to the bottom of the vaginal opening for a more (anatomical) look was an epic fail. The patient had to then have her labia cut since this technique caused pain during dilating as well as the patient had issues walking and separating her legs .  10. In the end this patient had to seek help with other various surgeons. Luckly Dr Kamol took her on as a patient and tried his best to correct the many mistakes made .  11. Fortunately she survived the body shock and various surgeries with Suporn at first then dr Kamol was able to remove the érectile tissue and core that was left . He also repaired the urethra and labia’s.  12. Unfortunately there is no way to repair the lack of sensitivity lost from her clitoris and sensate nerve and this she must live with for the rest of her life !!!
</p>
<p>
I took the time to write this since so many praise Dr Suporn without knowing all the damage and pain he has caused to so many patients .  And people still are  promoting his terrible clinic .
</p>
<p>
I just want people knowing the truth before making such a life changing surgery .
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Thai law saves many of these surgeons from losing there licenses and basically allowing them to get away with murder . Just like the group of patients that were gunned down at a coffee shop in “Chomburi” . Since they were working on a class action lawsuit against the Suporn clinic .
</p>
<p>
People need to know that Suporns clinic is not safe and not the way to go when seeking a surgery in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
Seriously take the time to make an informed decision on exactly where to go so that you receive a proper surgery and are happy with the outcome.
</p>
<p>
And remember it’s Thailand there are no laws regarding false advertising on a surgeons website. Remember there are false reviews as well as patients who had decent surgeries then the become”loyalists” promoting there surgeon even if other patients were not treated as well as them . Also it’s practically impossible to try to sue for malpractice since well it’s Thailand.
</p>
<p>
In the end Dr Kamol is the only safe surgeon that I know of that offers a safe surgery. He has a hospital and not a clinic !!! He guarantees his work and has a great bedside manor. Unlike Suporn where many know him as the “Butcher of Bangkok “ there’s a reason why his clinic is not in Bangkok...and many others describe him as immoral where he treats people like there nothing. He does not care about the pain you go through. Example many compared his clinic as a nazi concentration camp where they felt like they were tortured during there stay there .
</p>
<p>
Sorry but the truth needs to be shared !!!

She’s not lying about some of the things I’m not sure about everything. My Doctor and psychiatrist and a transgender woman that I know was strongly against me going to Suporn for SRS because some of the reason this person has mentioned.

I Am Triss Sky Metcher. I had my SRS / grs at Dr Suporn clinic with administration under a not now is in administration as well as several other doctors running his clinic he has retired and he&#39;s now training surgeons in other countries a simple technique he has many procedures and many doctors working under him with a full support tech team I have had him in to legal major lawsuits I also am in a group as administration on Facebook known as tcas I have my code of conduct and ethics I&#39;ve spoken to all surgeons around the world that are mainly known mostly in the southern hemisphere I have done promos for doctors working in the plaster team helping the transgender in desperate scenario situations in hospitals and advising I personally referred medical information to surgeons now due to the knowledge that I have learnt and procedures that I have learnt of GR ssrs procedures I am not going to go in Pacific as I do not want this to turn into an encyclopaedia.
</p>
<p>
Primary I have had six of my friends die I have had 42 surgeries I have official documentation I have lawyers I have translators and I have full records of all communicate with all legal and medical ongoing and previous dealings with my recovery for a year and a half of a walking cane and half a year crawling on my back physio to walk again reconstruction of 5 vaginal complete reconstructions till in the end I myself told a doctor how to repair me from getting advice from half around the world from other grs surgeons the Pacifics of my case are well known to those in the medical profession.
</p>
<p>
Any major documentation or evidence needed in a court of law for anyone that requires information or wishes information directly from me May always p.m. me for personal conversation through Facebook through tcas or directly on my email I do show and will show evidence of what I have gone through and as I always say helping others is helping yourself to become a better person the goal that I set out was there is no post-operative care in Australia eye clinic from the government official health services of Australia needs a post-operative care unit with pre operative procedures and advice the safe guidance I have started to implement this.
</p>
<p>
Danica rain is a known Advocate in my last two repairs of surgical reconstruction at kamel hospital has allowed me to have a life again I still am going through slight physio in my left leg but I can walk jump urinate and sit I am happy to be able to live even knowing I&#39;m on a pension for my life due to nerve damage.
</p>
<p>
I have nerve damage to my legs and to the full sensual sexual nervous system the clitoral nerve was removed as much repairs have been done including a full vaginal scar tattooing which is now being admitted into the Guinness Book of Records those who wish to state statements without information or backup for their statements should not make a statement facts are facts.
</p>
<p>
I give thanks to the medical profession of the plaster team of Brisbane Sydney Melbourne United States of America Canada and I stated the surgeon that actually allowed me do you have somewhat of a life again my ongoing advocacy in the transgender community I have retired my ongoing referral and medical advice and Surgical reconstruction or repair continues as I enter into the medical profession into politics.
</p>
<p>
Danica rain what&#39;s my liaison and allowed me to have a life again and has helped so many others and herself has gone through so much one should not judge one when one has not walked in ones own footsteps.
</p>
<p>
Any other information required from me or then medical affectional Lincoln international advisory and referral including transgender global groups as well as general day-to-day advice.
</p>
<p>
Is what I dedicate my life to so no one will have to go through this I do not stand alone I am not alone there are many people out there in worse predicaments than myself do not think for one moment having an SRS grs procedure is like clipping your fingernails,
</p>
<p>
There are many different procedures for this every human body is different and react differently if a surgery is done correctly the outcome is 85% successful a negative under 45% is very rare but not uncommon I have known hundreds and no hundreds that are out there that cannot be repaired and I still trying not just from the doctor that botched me but from many doctors do not think for one moment that any surgeon does not have a complaint or does not have problematical cases.
</p>
<p>
Button unethical clinic that is literally killing people should most definitely be broadcasted I never to do this and I do not stand alone and I have done this already.
</p>
<p>
As for Danica rain yes she does volunteer her time as a liaison to this particular hospital as they are the only ones in the world that could fix me one would think that he&#39;s a decent surgeon he has his own hospital and complete dilational room and full care after so many surgeries and so much finances why do you think I went there I know my ad I went there after my own research I&#39;m at Danica after my first surgery my second surgery she helped me as I was having difficulty in communications as my repairs were that severe.
</p>
<p>
I will not go into the full complexity of what was done maymay fallen friends that lay and rest on this day and many days before know that in their words as they said to me at least one of us makes it one of us can tell the story.
</p>
<p>
I am most definitely here for the community and for safe guidance and as for Danica rain all I can do is say thank you for what she did for me and her help and guidance to many different surgeons and advice too many different transgender groups community and public media.

I actually don’t work for anyone , I volunteer my time in helping people find information regarding transitioning as well as safe surgeons. I don’t just send people to one place . I know many safe surgeons depending on what surgeries your interested in as well as location being what country. For example if you were Canadian then I would give you information regarding the care provided in Canada and other options if you wanted to go out of country and so on depending where you are .
</p>
<p>
As for my friend that I had spoken about I have asked her to join this site . She will be posting soon .
</p>
<p>
Something you need to understand it is not easy for anyone to speak up after having been through so much . Especially speaking about an issue that’s extremely personal.
</p>
<p>
But I asked her to speak up on here so most can hear her story and give them the chance of not going through what she did .
</p>
<p>
And if you want to try to discredit me then try as hard as you can . Since you can just google my name I am a well known Trans Advocate in Canada and internationally .
</p>
<p>
I gave my opinion on Dr Suporn !  I’ll put him down as much as I want . He may have silenced others but he can silence me or pay me off !!! especially if it will save lives if people know the truth on what happens at his clinic.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to sit here and say nothing when I’ve seen first hand what happened to my friend.
</p>
<p>
And for you to call me a liar ? Well how bout you do a little re-search on me and you can formulate a real opinion! Since anyone who knows me knows I tell the truth and I’ve always done my best to help the trans community.

I&#39;ve been to Suporn, and I&#39;m in contact with quite a few other girls through various channels (who&#39;ve been to him), and I haven&#39;t heard those horror stories. Quite the contrary, actually. PM me if you want.

Unlike Suporn where many know him as the “Butcher of Bangkok “ there’s a reason why his clinic is not in Bangkok...
</p>

<p>
The &#34;Butcher Of Bangkok&#34; is a different surgeon, who actually is in Bangkok. Suporn&#39;s is neither.

Actually Dr Suporn in the past was doing surgeries in Bangkok but he was dismissed and he proceeded with his own clinic outside of Bangkok in Chomburi.
</p>
<p>
Saying he is neither is not true . I have all my medical documents stating everything i went through.  And yes he did butcher me
</p>
<p>
I never took his bribes for silence . Ive still been recovering from my various surgeries.  And once im strong enough i will be proceeding with taking him to court for the final court case!

It&#39;s well known who the the surgeon nicknamed the Butcher of Bangkok actually is, and it&#39;s not Suporn. I can&#39;t see how you can possibly argue that.
</p>
<p>
As for the rest, first I&#39;ve heard of it.

<p>
Sorry to pick up on this one tiny part of your post but can I ask what makes it a hospital exactly? From what I can tell it&#39;s a very well equipped clinic with post anaesthesia units and an ambulance on standby outside affiliated with two very highly regarded hospitals which are approx 8 minutes away in case of an emergency.
</p>
<p>
So my understanding is if something does go wrong the patient they would need to be transported.
</p>
<p>
Have I understood this right? Just doing my research atm :)

Pretty much spot on , compared to other surgeons  who have small clinics who then hire OR time at other hospitals to do the surgery.
