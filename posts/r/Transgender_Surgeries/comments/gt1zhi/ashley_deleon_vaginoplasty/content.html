Hey there!  I&#39;m fairly new to the sub but I wanted to ask if anyone here has had the one phase vaginoplasty with Dr. Ashley DeLeon (Crane Surgical Center) in Austin, Texas.
</p>
<p>
How satisfied were you with the results?
</p>
<p>
I got to see photos of her work and it looks promising but I wanted to get y&#39;all&#39;s opinion.

I had it with her last August and I&#39;m really happy with the results. I have had some issues with granulation but she has been really good at treating it in the follow up appointments I&#39;ve had.

I had GCS Vaginoplasty with her very recently. I’m only a few weeks out, but I have very positive things to say about the whole experience and about her work so far. Like others, the sample work I saw in the consults looked beautiful to me and that’s what I wanted. Message me if you have any questions.

Following.
</p>
<p>
Did you schedule something in office to be able to review her work? She wasn&#39;t able to share anything remotely when I had a consult about a month ago.

I am scheduled with her for July, what I saw of her work during the in person consult look really good.
