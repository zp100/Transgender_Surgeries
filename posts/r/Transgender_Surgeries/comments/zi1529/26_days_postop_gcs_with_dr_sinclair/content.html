I&#39;m concerned about the area in the bottom right which he has a red, jelly-like appearance. Previously, it had a wet scab on it. It looks like this patch extends into my vaginal canal
</p>
<p>
Is this a normal part of healing or is this something to be concerned with? I have an appointment next week with my surgeon where I will ask but any information I can get on it now would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, things are going well. I&#39;ve settled into a rhythm with dilating and it seems to be going well. I can reach my max depth within 5-10 minutes and then I can hold it without too much difficulty.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m dilating 4 times a day and I&#39;m a little anxious about keeping that schedule in January when I go back to work.

Hey there! Im cracking into three weeks post-op, and this looks like the next stage of scar development (granulation). Usually this isn&#39;t a major concern, as the next step is where your body creates the scar.
</p>
<p>
It can turn into hyper granulation which is another complication, where it creates too much blood supply for the scar!! I&#39;m having some mild granulation tissue appear in the gaps in my scar gaps, but on the top.
</p>
<p>
These are pretty standard processes for healing sutures. If you can, keep it open to the air for a bit of the day but continue the disinfection stuff you are likely doing (creams, and salt baths). Make sure your surgeon is aware next week in case they need to step it up somehow ✌️
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, it&#39;s looking pretty good!!!

It&#39;s totally fine; you are putting so little salt in it does not affect your bits in much of anything, not like you&#39;re pickling yourself! It&#39;s mostly to irrigate your sutures and to allow a clean site to apply antibiotic cream/corticosteroids and get a fresh pad.

ok thats good to know, i thought the salt would interact with the healing and burn, like salt in a cut

It&#39;s essentially saline which is body neutral.

Looks like your surgeon did a good job. I know it&#39;s rough now, but I think once you&#39;ve healed up some more everything is going to be great.

I had it similar to you around that time. I actually had to stop sitz baths because I was getting so much dehiscence from humidity. Best of luck, it is very hard, but it will pass!
