<strong>
Overview
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m writing this 9 months after my experience as I thought I’d wait and see also I just got busy with life and ADHD executive dysfunction and wanted to give this due attention. Please forgive the terrible stream of consciousness style as otherwise I’d never get this done!!! Hopefully I cover all my thoughts and experiences pretty well. I had my SRS on Nov 2 2021 (“taco Tuesday!”) and BA 2 weeks or so later.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Overall I am so happy with my results and experience of Dr Kamol SRS-PPV. I had minimal complications if any in the hospital, minimal complications afterwards (bar 1 infection of thrush / bv I got by having sex before I was supposed to because I ignored the Drs’ guidance which was all gone after some antibiotics). On a day to day basis there is minimal to no pain at most times and I rarely get infections with regular showering and keeping hands clean when having sex, dilating and just living my life.
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The hospital was clean and modern and lovely and all the staff were absolutely lovely. The only issue is the language barrier but if you stick with Darcie Silver she’ll coordinate and translate where needed and by god does that woman work insane long hours and get into the detail. She paid kind friendly drop in visits before and after the surgery to make sure everything was going ok (and to navigate language barriers around organisation) and is always available on WhatsApp - which for the anxiety ridden like me was a god send.
</p>
<p>
It’s worth noting Darcie has had her SRS with Kamol so this really is a eating your own dog food situation.
</p>
<p>
The SRS itself (I’m now 9 months post op) is great. It gets wet, I have decent 5.5 inch depth with regular dilating once a day (just use a large nice sex toy after you become able to), it smells right, it looks great (had a partner who didn’t ask and I didn’t tell I was trans - they didn’t remark on anything so I assume they didn’t know).
</p>
<p>
I will say I can still tell personally that it’s not a natal vagina, and at first I was wanting a picture Percent vagina but honestly now I’m just happy and relieved it works, doesn’t hurt, doesn’t get infected and I’m all done wi with surgeries other than with dilating once a day.
</p>
<p>
It took me a long time to orgasm but with lots of dilating and practicing you get used to it and it’s all possible and feels really really good.
</p>
<p>
So overall, so happy I went there, really happy with my result and so so grateful I’m healthy and pain free and can enjoy my life and SRS. The only sticking points were consistent language barriers and travelling but those are easily mitigated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
To arrange I reached out via the website which Darcie has redone (it’s very good). It was has plenty of realistic results pictures and easy contact details.
</p>
<p>
Darcie reached out as the English speaking coordinator via WhatsApp and was so friendly and super responsive to all my anxious questions. I would say definitely ask everything to her because dr Kamol himself is very busy and not a man of many words (extremely friendly and professional however) so longer form more nitty gritty details questions are best answered by Darcie who herself is a Kamol SRS patient, so it’s a pretty reliable review!
</p>
<p>
I arranged a date which I easily moved around a few times, and went back and forth a lot on different options for accommodation and adding breast augmentation which I also had.
</p>
<p>
This stuff changed around a lot because of my own finances etc but darcie was always on it to make and update invoices and take money, she works so hard and always replies!!! Very impressed and relieved, as going to Thailand made me super anxious and worried I was going to get botched and deal with a dodgy unregulated medical practice, not the case at all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Travelling
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had to travel during covid lockdowns so getting a travel visa was super involved but again darcie was so helpful and sent super clear instructions and all the links and answered all the questions. It took AGES to get into the country but I had everything I needed by following all the instructions and the day I landed all the restrictions got lifted! This was a little chaotic because the hospital had made a quarantine room for 1 r days which we then could leave and come back to but we’d kinda setup and paid for quarantine! Without covid travelling would be much nicer!
</p>
<p>
I had my flights cancelled multiple times but found Thai Airways were the most convenient direct flights (because changing in UAE seems dangerous for trans people imo) and they weren’t too pricey. I flew from london which took 14 hours and had minimal issues there and back!
</p>
<p>
The flight back was a little uncomfortable but using the cushion you get everything is all fine.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving in Thailand there were news crews as we were the first British tourists since Thailand lockdowns and a very coordinated taxi system where the hospital chauffeur picked us up in a really fancy air conditioned car/limo with recliner seats which was super fancy and not expected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Hospital
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving to hospital jet lag kicked in and I got told my surgery had been brought forward (yay and also scary) and that I was due the next day (originally thought I had a day of rest).
</p>
<p>
The hospital is lovely and air conditioned with a lovely lobby with a fancy fountain and garden and grounds and very well maintained. It was super empty because I arrived on the very first day Thailand lifted restrictions and they were just rebooting. After a few weeks it was bustling again as more patients filled up the rooms.
</p>
<p>
The room was gorgeous and huge and they were so kind to upgrade me to a vip room given that everything was empty and we bought the quarantine package, although we got moved after a few weeks and recovery to the hotel next to the hospital which is also really lovely. The rooms had great tv, great Wifi (surprised), great air con and lovely big beds. All the staff in every desk and office and hospital are so lovely and friendly and sweet despite not speaking a lot of English sometimes, absolute saints. Google Translate app is your friend!!! The Wifi was really fast which is a god send for not being bored, and the showers and toilets were in good order and clean and lovely.
</p>
<p>
The hospital is in a busy area of Bangkok which is lots of concrete and busy roads but relatively walkable with a huge supermarket in one direction, and lots of restaurants and bars nearby. I spent a lot of time in the very cute and close ‘Town in Town’ shopping precinct which had some lovely restaurants and a Starbucks with lush Wifi and air conditioning! I treated this as a little practice treat of walking and getting of them hospital! After 3 or so weeks I even took some trips via taxi out to the huge Siam shopping centres and one of the palaces and temples!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Preparation for Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Apart from non-mandatory electrolysis over months before the surgery on the area, the only other prep was being under a certain weight for my height so that laparoscopy would work (for me 70kg).
</p>
<p>
To begin prep which is super intense yoh drink 3 very awful salty laxatives (I projectile vomited one of them up) and then get douched out by nurses until you’re all crystal clear and your digestive tract is clean and empty, then it’s just water. This can take a while but it’s not uncomfortable just funny and awkward.
</p>
<p>
Then the next day I waited patiently and eventually was wheeled in (terrified) and given my drip etc. then dr Kamol and his team come in to talk. I’d mostly asked all my questions to darcie (I highly recommend you do this) as Dr Kamol is pressed for time and quite to the point. He asked if I had any questions and I had some (not many) then he told me that each patient differs due to available tissue etc etc but I showed him some examples I liked quickly and he seemed approving. It was over super quick, so be warned! Friendly but quick.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was told the surgery took like 5-7 hours, and that all went ok.
</p>
<p>
I can’t remember much after waking up but I was wheeled into the temporary recovery ward to let the anaesthesia wear off which can take like 4 hours, I remember hallucinating that someone was giving birth next to me and hearing a screaming baby and that making total sense because it was a hospital! So so strange, I thought that was real and then when I ask about it I was told that’s obviously not a thing in this hospital. How bizarre! It felt so real.
</p>
<p>
The recovery was pretty damn intense but got easier as time went on. In the first few days I really don’t remember much other than being extremely nauseated and sore and not being able to move much and there being a lot of gauze and blood and wires, including having a dilator in, scary!!
</p>
<p>
The pain was pretty manageable up until the trapped gas from the laparoscopy and instability of my body to get rid of it (I assume everything down there is swollen). The gas the worse part by far and for about 24 hours I was in 11/10 pain because I kept producing gas, not being able to pass it, swelling up so so much and then taking morphine every 4 hours (which gave 30 mins of relief), j was literally counting down the seconds until the next shot.
</p>
<p>
The gas kept making me throw up and I couldn’t eat so for that 24-25 hours I was just vomiting bile being extremely sore and praying for that to end.
</p>
<p>
Eventually you’ll do a MASSIVE fart and then keep farting which is hilarious and gross and then keep farting and everything gets way way way better, and the pain dials down to like a 4/10 imo.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Aftercare
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After this the nurses will visit twice a day to dilate you for an hour each time (they can sometimes be a tiny bit rushed so ask to try yourself) and they’ll watch to make sure you go the full 6 inches which can hurt, then you hold it in for your hours session.
</p>
<p>
The cooked food at the hospital is super super cheap and legitimately SO nice. I recommend the curry and rice when you’re allowed back on solids it’s spicy as hell but so good.
</p>
<p>
Eventually you’ll start pooping more normally again (this hurts A LOT), after you stand up. I was supposed to stand up after 3 days but I kept bleeding a lot so it took me like a week which was super worrying. Once I stood up I took a few baby steps and got SO tired and felt dizzy but this gets easier as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
I think Dr Kamol’s wife helps run the hospital and she came to visit and squeeze my hand and she was like some kind of lovely smiley Angel!!
</p>
<p>
Darcie then kept paying little friendly visits and this is how things were for a couple of weeks, after a few days I then started waddling down the road to the Starbucks to sit for like an hour or so!
</p>
<p>
After week 2/3 you start to go to ‘dilation school’ where you go down to the lower floors in these little booths were 2 nurses will first remove the catheter which is a whole process.
</p>
<p>
You have to train your bladder to work with your new equipment so you drink 4-5 bottles of water and wait then they tie a knot in the catheter and ask you to wait until you can feel it in your bladder. Then they YANK it out (quick means less pain) as you sit on a toilet and you’re good to go, and you then practice peeing!
</p>
<p>
Every 10am and 3pm I had to go down and practice dilating whilst being watched and instructed on the proper process of cleaning, swabbing, applying lots of different creams and lotions and then dilating. They come back at the start and end to make sure you’re all good and talk you through it and you do this for like 1-2 weeks, with increasing independence as you go. This was a lovely opportunity to chat to the other girls and make friends through the walls of the booths!
</p>
<p>
After 2/3 weeks I was able to walk around a few hours a day but still sore and very very drained, and was ready to go home. The last stage is removing stitches was is super intense.
</p>
<p>
They ask you to stay super still and slowly use scissors to cut all the visible stitches and slowly pull them out, which is very scary and painful sometimes but over quick if you grins and bear it. Some women screamed but I tend to freeze up and go silent which was actually a blessing!!
</p>
<p>
At week 2/3 of recovery I had a breast augmentation which was similar in prep time but much quicker surgery wise. The recovery from this was like someone punched me in the chest and I couldn’t move much or lift - this was more pain than the SRS! After a week of BA the compression bandages are taken off (pure relief) and you are checked every few days. After a few more days then remove the stitches which is a weird sensation but over quickly.
</p>
<p>
For food and taxis everyone uses the Grab app which is great and reliable and lets you order good to the hospital like Uber Eats style. Also super cheap!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Final Thoughts
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Now that I’ve had time to get used to a dilation routine and explore things I can honestly say I am so so grateful and so so lucky to have been through this process and come out of the other side and I am so happy with everything. Especially after speaking to some fellow Kamol patients (jn the dilation rooms) who had to get revisions after going via the NHS (15 years ago) and even Suporn (not sure when) and not being happy with their results or even having really bad complications, the fact they ended up with Kamol speaks volumes, as I was so so so so anxious I had picked a surgeon sub-optimally which I now totally think is not the case. Kamol is very talented and I’ve very few complications or pain. I can also say that it feels GREAT and works as expected. I was worried about how it looked for a while but honestly not an issue in reality. Whilst some results might LOOK 10/10 I favour functionality and health and painlessness over that, besides vaginas look weird anyway and I’ve been told by multiple partners they can’t tell and that it looks damn good!!
</p>
<p>
I’d be happy to answer questions via DMs or anything (I check Instagram more) and depending on the person share results images, but there are plenty of accurate SRS PPV results on the website which are very reflective of my results.

Personally, I wouldn&#39;t recommend Kamol to anyone but I&#39;m glad that you had a positive experience. 💕

I&#39;ve seen mixed reviews for sure, but hopefully my account was thorough enough! I think the main issue is communication and the language barrier maybe, definitely wouldn&#39;t have done it without a native English speaking correspondent.

Thank you for the break down I’m saving and planning I’m indecisive about about. Ppv Vs colon my fiancé is about 7 in half inches and pretty thick and I wanna be able to have sex with comfortably so I’m thinking ppv I’m just weighing out options sensation natural appearance and function is important to me I’m leaning more towards ppv just doing my research

Just my review, happy to prove I&#39;m real or whatever via DM. I think I was pretty fair in my praises and criticisms (chaotic scheduling and communication).
