I recommend sending g a photo to your surgeon. Tell them about your concerns. Ask what you should do to assist the healing. Include your contact info and ask to talk soon. If your don&#39;t hear anything in a day call their office. Then find a local Dr. who is trans friendly...otherwise the ER.  Don&#39;t panic. Just be your best personal advocate. And don&#39;t wait. Be positive but be insistent. You have come so far this is just another push...

To clarify, upon further inspection I can confirm a few things. First, it&#39;s definitely not dehiscence, there&#39;s no opening into my abdominal cavity. The wound is entirely  on the surface. All my sutures have already healed very quickly and are intact. Second, I researched a bit more into wound healing processes and found out that it&#39;s actually already healing around the edges, with the silvery pink epithelium building up on the far edges of the wound. The wound itself appears like a healthy non-infected wound. I&#39;ve also contacted my surgeon around 8 hours ago, but I haven&#39;t got a reply yet. I&#39;ll continue treating it the way I have been, since that seems to be working.  It just takes so long. It&#39;s already been 17 days, normally I&#39;d heal faster than this, but given the intensity of this surgery I suppose that&#39;s to be expected.

It looks like you have dehiscence along the bottom of your labia on both sides that is healing up but is still raw.
</p>
<p>
Continue to treat it according to your surgeon&#39;s instructions for dealing with dehiscence and keep send them updated photos as things continue change so they can keep updating your care routine as needed.

Just send some images to your surgeon and ask them. As dehiscence goes, that&#39;s not bad at all. It&#39;s understandable why your concerned, but there&#39;s very little intervention to be done outside of letting it heal at the moment. It&#39;s healing by

Is your surgeon the one from Uniklinik Hessen? I&#39;m still far far away from getting any surgery myself, but I&#39;m trying to note down a few good ones and the kind of procedure you got is exactly what I want.

I consider Dr HeÃŸ to be one of the top 5 Vaginoplasty surgeons in the world. The Combined Method is said to be the most difficult to heal of any of the common Vaginoplasty variants, but is supposed to yield a very aesthetic and functional result. I&#39;m still only a few weeks out of surgery, so I can&#39;t really say if any of these are true but I&#39;ll definitely keep reporting about my progress

My waiting time was around one and a half years after I had all my paperwork figured out. I can&#39;t tell how it&#39;s going to be for you, but definitely start as soon as u can

Yes, Dr HeÃŸ is at the Uniklinik Essen. He&#39;s a very good surgeon, but can be difficult to reach for questions

It seems like granulation tissue which means that o that part epithelium is missing and should be taken care of. Iâ€™d strongly advice to contact your surgeon.

Do you think so? I have some medihoney gel I bought in preparation. Do you think I should use it on this? Having researched about wound healing processes it seems the gel was made specifically for this exact purpose, you might be right

It cleared mine up in a week or two and it was 10 times worse than yours.

Oh, I do have a question about that. When you applied the medihoney, did you bandage it up for healing or leave it open to the air? I&#39;m trying to do this the best way possible

I put aquaphor on it but either way works now that I think about it. Putting a piece of gauze would probably help keep panties from being ruined. The medihoney actually works no matter what. But itâ€™s best if itâ€™s not rubbed off.

Yes apply it! It even works on your dilatior if you have granulation inside
