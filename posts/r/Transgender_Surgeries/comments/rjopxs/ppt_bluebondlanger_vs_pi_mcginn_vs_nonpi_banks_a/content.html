PPT (Bluebond-Langer) vs. PI (McGinn) vs. non-PI (Banks) - A lot of conflicting info out there. Can anyone help clarify the differences? What exactly is motivating surgeons to practice each techniques? How is Suporn&#39;s technique not being practiced anywhere else?

I&#39;ve been trying to research SRS for a while now and I&#39;m really struggling to find actual explanations for the different techniques vary. It doesn&#39;t help that the three surgeons I&#39;m most considering, Banks, BBL, and McGinn all use seemingly different techniques? I&#39;m looking for some clarity on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What the hell does everything map to? Is this understanding correct:
<ul>
<li>
Banks (Suporn Clinic) - Canal is mostly scrotal, labia is penile skin, and glans is used for clit and part of labia minora
</li>
<li>
McGinn - Canal is penile skin and sometimes scrotum, labia is scrotum (I think?), glans is used for clit
</li>
<li>
Bluebond - Canal is scrotum + peritoneal flap, labia is penile skin, and glans is used for clit
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Why exactly is Suporn&#39;s technique both so revered and seemingly impossible to replicate? It seems doubtful to me that all US surgeons have been completely unable to replicate his technique for decades? I can&#39;t get any clear info on what actually makes it different from modern SRS, since most surgeons now use scrotal grafts instead of discarding the scrotal skin.
</li>
<li>
Why exactly is it that Bluebond needs to use the peritoneal flap in the first place when the other surgeons promise similar depths using only scrotal skin unless you&#39;re extremely small? Suporn seems able to get consistently deep canals even with small amounts of donor tissue without using any sort of external graft? How is this even possible?
</li>
<li>
Are there any actual practical differences in outcomes among the three? The main thing BBL said was better was increased depth, but the other two seem to think that won&#39;t be a problem with their techniques. All three surgeons are making the same promises with depth, function, sensitivty, etc.
</li>
<li>
What&#39;s the deal with the massively varying aesthetic outcomes with BBL? McGinn and Suporn have very consistently great looking aesthetics but every single Bluebond (or Min Jun, who uses a similar technique) photo I&#39;ve seen looks completely different than the last and ranges from good to results I would not personally be happy with.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I guess the thing I would most love is an explanation of how PI, PPT, and non-PI even work and differ. Every thread I&#39;m reading ends up just having people bashing techniques they didn&#39;t have and pushing the one they did select for very unclear reasons.
</p>
<p>
Everyone keeps saying there&#39;s no best technique, only the one that you think is best, but I can&#39;t find any criteria to even form an opinion on which to select.
</p>
<p>
Edit: okay, so I&#39;ve done a bit more research on where everything maps and here&#39;s what I&#39;m getting:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Suporn/Banks
<ul>
<li>
Canal - Scrotal skin (&#39;meshing&#39; technique), urethral mucosal tissue, and tunica vaginalis (testes)
</li>
<li>
Clitoris - Glans used for hood, clit, and &#39;secondary sensate organ&#39; below clit
</li>
<li>
Labia minora - Penile skin. Also uses glans for upper part of minora for increased sensitivity
</li>
<li>
Labia majora - Any leftover penile skin, and then scrotal skin
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Bluebond
<ul>
<li>
Canal - Entrance is scrotal, middle is penile, rest of the depth is peritoneum
</li>
<li>
Clitoris - Glans used for clit. Not sure about hood.
</li>
<li>
Labia minora - Penile skin
</li>
<li>
Labia majora - Scrotal skin and some penile skin
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
McGinn (one I&#39;m least sure about)
<ul>
<li>
Canal - Penile skin, and then back part will sometimes have scrotal graft, might have some urethral tissue as well but not sure
</li>
<li>
Clitoris - Glans used for clit, penile skin for hood
</li>
<li>
Labia minora - Scrotal skin, possibly some urethral tissue (?)
</li>
<li>
Labia majora - Scrotal skin and some penile skin
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

With respect to the last part of the question:
</p>
<p>
Suporn’s technique has a long recovery period. You’re stuck in hospital for a week and another 3 weeks with daily nurse visits and bi-weekly surgeons visits. No one’s going to pay for that in the USA.
</p>
<p>
The USA does have rather awesome marketing though. Combine that with insurance only paying locally, if that, and so few people willing to travel, and why should they make any changes?

I&#39;ve heard that a few times now when people ask why Suporn&#39;s technique never made it over and yeah I think it is indeed a mix of his techniques being proprietary / underdocumented, and US surgeons having less incentive to double the operating time and recovery time by trying to copy his techniques from guesswork. I&#39;d also imagine many doctors simply just do it the way they were taught, and not many doctors are willing to deviate from the standard and experiment the way Suporn did when he was much younger to get to his current technique.

So I went to BBL and as for the depth question, she seems to get more depth than most standard techniques. If I&#39;m really relaxed and dilating, I can get all but maybe 1 cm of the soul source orange dilator inside of my canal. Thats over 8 inches of depth. And I&#39;m hardly an outlier. Most other surgeons get around 7 inches max, from what Ive observed.

Suporn was trained by Dr. Preecha, but developed his own method circa 2000.  He emeshes the scrotum graft for the canal, and this combined with rigorous dilation seems to consistently produce 6.5 inches of depth.  At the same time, (BITD)Western docs like Brassard and Menard were getting about five inches of depth.  Other docs like Chet, Sanguan, Kamol, Theerapong and others in Thailand use variations of Suporn’s method.
</p>
<p>
The other Suporn breakthrough was in aesthetics, particularly in the production of clitoral hoods and inner labia.  When Suporn really became popular, some women were still getting basically a 1950s style “hole” with no inner labia.   Suporn was light years beyond this kind of result, and he became the world standard, circa 2005 or so.
</p>
<p>
McGinn is very good at doing PI.  We don’t tend to hear much about complications from her patients.  PI offers a much easier and shorter recovery compares to Suporn’s method.
</p>
<p>
BBL is the newest to the group of top surgeons.  She has a novel approach with the partial PPT, and seems to rarely have major complications.  That said, I do think her aesthetics lack behind Suporn and McGinn’s results: but that’s only an opinion.  I suspect that she will be refining and her best work is yet to come as is Dr. Bank’s: Suporn’s protege.

Confusing why your reply is aimed at me?
</p>
<p>
As for BBL aesthetics being behind anyone&#39;s, that&#39;s not been my experience. Sure the best of the best suporn and mcginn results are better than the best bluebond-langner results from what I can tell. But average wise? I think bluebond-langner wins here, especially if we are talking no / pre revision.
</p>
<p>
The major benefit of going with bluebond-langner / nyu is that the average result is passable enough for stealth sex while also having low variance. Yes it&#39;s not as picture perfect as the best result Ive ever seen, but you have a really high chance that you&#39;ll end up with a functional and passable result.
</p>
<p>
Suporn&#39;s results look best after revision. The best result Ive ever seen was someone who had had 4 revisions with him.

Yep everything in this comment is basically what I found from research too. I still see a lot of results that have only a very cursory inner labia (just a very thin strip of flesh-colored skin), so not quite a &#39;hole&#39; but more of a flesh-colored slit.
</p>
<p>
Your overview tracks with me. McGinn&#39;s technique is older, but is insanely good aesthetically and functionally for PI.
</p>
<p>
BBL is very safe can maximize depth, and seems very on the ball with everything functioning. She takes a lot more from Suporn&#39;s technique than most any US surgeon without having as brutal of a recovery, but in my opinion her aesthetics range from very good to lacking relative to McGinn/Suporn.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, I think I&#39;m going to go with Suporn if I can nab a date next year before his retirement, or Banks if Suporn is out.

tysm for this super informative and thorough post!!!
</p>
<p>
re: the depth thing, I ended up doing more research (updated post too with info), and from what I can tell BBL will basically always get you to your anatomical max which is 6-8 in. for most people.
</p>
<p>
Suporn also has a fairly good track record of getting 6 in+, which is kind of mystifying but I think is he because he works to use a
<em>
lot
</em>
of tissue that most surgeons discard, and creates the canal from a mix of scrotal, urethral, and tunica vaginalis (testes) tissue. The scrotal skin also seems to be prepared in a way that allows it to cover more surface area. He seems to have a very good track record with depth regardless of penis size, although if you&#39;re too small (or heavily circumcised) he will have to use scrotal tissue grafts to finish the minora which he considers suboptimal.
</p>
<p>
From what I can tell, although McGinn does use scrotal grafts for the canal now, her technique is most dependent on donor size. I&#39;ve seen a lot of post in the 4-5 in range so I&#39;m a little less certain of her 6 in+ promise.
</p>
<p>
IMO Bluebond is on the right track and getting quite close to parity with Suporn&#39;s technique, and has the advantage of the addition of the peritoneal tissue to max out on depth.
</p>
<p>
However, I think as you mentioned Suporn/Banks just have a special eye for aesthetics, particularly with the labia and avoiding a lot of the pitfalls of the US techniques (namely, where labia minora is above the canal instead of around it, or small / undifferentiated labia minora or hood that makes it look more &#39;slit-like&#39; instead of having lips). The Suporn recovery seems to take much longer and be more painful; I think this is due to the way he prepares the scrotal tissue in the canal. He seems to also take much longer to perform the surgery, which I think is due to the complexity of the labia minora, and the way he uses so much of the glans to construct the entire clitoral hood and area instead of just using a fraction of the existing head and discarding the rest like most US surgeons do. BBL seems to be excellent with minimizing scars though so that&#39;s another aesthetic consideration.
</p>
<p>
I have my BBL date coming up soon but am leaning slightly towards switching to Suporn/Banks but not totally sure yet (paying out of pocket + distance are the main hangups for me). I think they&#39;re both excellent doctors and BBL is probably the safest and most consistent choice in the US, maybe anywhere. The only concern I would have at all is aesthetic, which can be revised anyways as long as the functionality and structure / depth are in place. Good luck and thank you again for all of the help I hope things go amazing for you!!!! :)

this is a great post, with some great questions.  I am surprised that nobody has brought up Dr Heidi Wittenberg at Mozaic.  I have looked at several of the other doctors you mentioned here, mainly Suporn and BBL, but am leaning towards Wittenberg.
</p>
<p>
I am completely in agreement that the Thai aesthetics are generally well above BBL.  But I have found Dr. Wittenberg a close second.  What really swayed me towards her is her outcomes on clitoral sensation, and the differences in her method.  She leaves it a little bigger, places it lower...and quotes a 96% clitoral orgasm success rate within one year
