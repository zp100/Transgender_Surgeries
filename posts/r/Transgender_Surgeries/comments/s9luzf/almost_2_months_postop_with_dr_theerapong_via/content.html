The blisters are finally gone and I can finally go more than I could last month. I still message Siam Transformation if I have any questions and they still reply quickly. There&#39;s less pain and I&#39;m hopefully completely ok in two months. I can have sex in the end of january if I want to, but my boyfriend and I have decided to wait a little bit. He doesn&#39;t want to hurt me/damage the neovagina.  I sometimes still bleed a bit when I pee, but it will go away eventually. (talked to them about it). My clitoris works fine. Have orgasmed a few times and it takes quicker than preop. Tried go finger myself a bit tonight (with gloves)., and it actually felt good. I&#39;m satisfied so far üòä

Edit: Siam Transformation is the name of Becky and Cherry&#39;s company. They are the ones I have always been in touch with before, during, and after SRS.

It looks pretty good, as soon as you heal you will have a very good result, I have a couple of questions: How has your recovery been so far? Do you still have the same vaginal depth from the surgery? How has vaginal lubrication been with the peritoneal technique?

Recovery has been good so far. I can stand up, sit, and walk for longer periods of time. I notice improvements weekly.  I still have almost same depth. I have 17cm so far (a bit short of 7 inches, but not so much). I can dilate twice a day, 40 minutes each session or 1 80-minute session. I have chosen 1 session a day so far and I have maintained 17cm. It is tighter when I start, but it&#39;s not painful. Lubrication is ok. Not overlubricating. I still prefer to have lube tho.

I think it&#39;s best to message them They reply fast in messenger. I&#39;m not updated about the prices üòÖ (did mine in 2021, and I think the prices go up every year)

wooooow amazinggg, you healed a lot from last update üòç can&#39;t wait for my turn with Dr.Thee
</p>
<p>
also a little question: I assume do you still feel pain from your post, does this pain affect your daily life even after 2 months or is more like a discomfort nuisance?

I think moving more actually helped me. I upped my vitamin-c intake too.
<br>
I still have a bit of pain when I walk a lot. It feels much better now than last month. I think it&#39;s more of a nuisance now than affecting my daily life so much. I can cook my own food, I do the laundry, clean the house, etc... My life is starting to get normal.
</p>
<p>
Today, I am challenging myself and I try not to lay down before 3pm. Started working at 7:30
