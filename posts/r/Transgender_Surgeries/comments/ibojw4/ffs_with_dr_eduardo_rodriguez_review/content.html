hello, I had FFS ~18 months or so ago with Dr. Rodriguez and wanted to post a review just to help out.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 31, been on hormones since I was 19.  Overall, very happy with the results.  I got forehead, brow, and chin done.  I didn&#39;t want any changes to be too dramatic and they haven&#39;t been, but I definitely feel better when I look in the mirror.  Dr. Rodriguez is super professional and caring and so was everyone in his office.  They also take insurance (even though I had to pay up front and I&#39;m still fighting that battle).  The cost with anethesia and everything came to like $27k, I went home the day of and the recovery was obviously unpleasant but fairly smooth.
</p>

I will say: it takes a long time for the results of FFS to really show.  I feel like I have really only come to appreciate the result in the past six months.  The swelling in my chin took forever to go down.  But now I&#39;m really happy.  Only thing I wish I had done was a fat transfer to my cheeks that he had recommended but I didn&#39;t do because I was paying up front.  Happy to answer any questions, can&#39;t post pics sorry.

Not a Rodriguez patient but how long did it take before all the jaw swelling was gone? It&#39;s been 10 months since my FFS and I think I still have quite a bit of swelling.

it was definitely a slow process.  I still look in the mirror occasionally after 18 months and I&#39;m like &#34;oh my chin seems to look better than it did before&#34;.  So I don&#39;t have an exact answer but it might still be healing for you.

Hi, thank you so much for posting this! I am looking into getting surgery with Dr Rodriguez and wanted to ask how you&#39;re feeling a few months down the road?
