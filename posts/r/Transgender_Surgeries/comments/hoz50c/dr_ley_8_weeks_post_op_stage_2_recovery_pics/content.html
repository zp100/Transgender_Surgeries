I have Ehlers-Danlos so my results are not something you should compare to

I can now use #3 goal dilator at 2.5”, #4 (the big boi) at 2” very very happy with my results especially how badly my skin tore up the first time.
</p>
<p>
I was having issues bleeding from granulation at the bottom (top?) of my vag after dilating and sometimes just activity, Dr. Ley was able to take out a disc of granulation. My bleeding is extremely minimal now and she also took care of my perineum skin fusing over the entrance to my vagina.
</p>
<p>
I am orgasmic both internally and externally, I can even get wet enough lube doesn’t need to be used thanks to progesterone.

Is the Ehlers-Danlos the reason for your limited depth, or did you go for a shallow depth vaginoplasty?

I had major dehiscence of the perineum and needed to stop dilating to let it heal. Accidentally dilated into the small dehiscence post op day 10, skin separated so easily I didn’t notice till I hit something very painful.
</p>
<p>
I started out with 6”

I&#39;m so sorry that happened. Do you think you&#39;ll be able to recover the depth or have a revision that recovers it?

If I ever find the cash or have insurance that would cover Peritoneal pull thru Heidi Whittenberg, it would be grafted onto whatever is existing there and add self lubing and cleaning supposedly.
</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t add much in terms of sensation but that would be fine as long as I can have full penetrative sex with my partner. I currently dilate once a week, if I did a more rigorous schedule it is entirely possible I could regain depth but I do not have the energy for that.
