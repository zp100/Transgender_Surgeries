I had basically the same issue after a PPT vaginoplasty with Dr. Del Corral. I went back to see him for a revision and almost all of the excess erectile tissue was removed and it is so much better! Fair warning, the revision was almost just as taxing physically as the first surgery! DM if you have any qs ü§ç

I did the PPT, not colon. It looked similar and the way she described it as a large &#34;bump, especially when aroused&#34; was exactly what I experienced

He did not explain why they ended up leaving so much erectile tissue. My 1st vaginoplasty took like 2.5 hours, much shorter than they anticipated it to be, and they deemed it a success with no complications. I later learned after I read the surgical report that it wasn&#39;t actually Del Coral who did the surgery, because it is a teaching hospital, some fellow did it but Del Coral was there in the room. So I&#39;m not sure if that had something to do with it, or if they just completely missed it. Maybe they were just rushing through it, who knows. After my revision Del Coral said there was &#34;a lot left behind&#34; and it was more intensive than he thought it would be, they ended up putting a catheter in and keeping me overnight in the hospital when it was supposed to be outpatient.

It seems the main issue is that they basically used way too much of your penile tissue. The head seems to be not cut at all or only a small amount was cut and the shaft also seems to have the same issue. But this is avtually better than having too little. Because when you‚Äôre having a revision there will be more to use which is a good thing. I hope you have the best resultsü´∂

Its fixable, but I&#39;d find a different surgeon. And be very careful choosing one.

Yeah this is not acceptable. I am sorry you feel bad as I would too! You deserve better, follow up with some of these knowledgeable commenters.

I&#39;m sorry you feel dysphoric after the surgery. I do think the bump on top is too large and i can understand your unhappiness. But i can&#39;t tell you if this is fixable or what the bump consists of. Only a surgeon can tell you.
</p>
<p>
You should definitely talk to your surgeon about this and what he thinks he can do about it with a revision. I recommend getting in touch with your health insurance and explain what happened. maybe they can be of assistance with finding other surgeons or the extra cost that may be involved.
</p>
<p>
After that, you can make an informed decision.

You should go to Dr M√°rcio Littleton, he‚Äôs the best surgeon for SRS here in Brazil. His revisions are amazing, as well!
