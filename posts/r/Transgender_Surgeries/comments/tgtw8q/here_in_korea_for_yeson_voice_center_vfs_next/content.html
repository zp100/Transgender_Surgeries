So yesterday was the big day! I had the surgery. Now it&#39;s 5am the next morning and i&#39;m back resting in my hotel room. Here is a breakdown of the day.
</p>
<p>
The day before surgery I had a pre-op appointment at 12:40pm at Yeson. I figured that Pablo would pick me up about an hour before hand however he arrived and messaged me at 10:47 that he was downstairs and for me to take my time coming down. I didn&#39;t see his message until 11:08 and so I told him I would be downstairs in 10 minutes. I hurried up and got ready and went down. We first went to separate location in order to have a chest x-ray done. This was the reason that Pablo came earlier than I had expected. Once that was done we headed to Yeson. They have the entire building now at their new location. Everything was new and clean. Reception is up on the 4th floor. Pablo went in with me to get me checked in and then I sat and waiting for Jessie. She came in 15 minutes or so later and sat with me and then we headed off to get some blood work done. From there we went to read the famous rainbow passage on camera. And then it was time to have my vocal cords recorded. Now this part was probably the worst part of the entire process
</p>
<p>
It involved sitting forward with elbows on your knees, head back and up high, tongue out (the nurse will use gauze and grab the end of your tongue to hold it out for you, then a metal rod with a camera on the end is placed into your mouth all the way to the very back and you have to make different sounds that they tell you make. The rough part is the rod in the mouth. If you have a bad gag reflex like I do it will be very difficult to get through the process without gagging interrupting the process. We had to stop and restart like 4 times in order for me to get through it. After that we read more passages in untrained and trained voices to analyze the voice.
</p>
<p>
After that we went back to 4th floor to wait to meet with Dr. Kim. First thing you do is have a camera down your nose for Dr. Kim to have a look at your vocal cords. I thought they would be horrible but in the end it wasn&#39;t that that bad. Not comfortable at all but not as bad as the camera rod down the throat was to me. After that we sat and Dr. Kim explains all about your case and what the results of the analysis of your vocal cords was. I has one side that was thicker than the other. They didn&#39;t close together all the way at the very back and I had a vocal tremor as well. All of this was correctable.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Kim is very nice and his bedside manner is really good. You have the opportunity to ask all of the questions that you may have. After meeting with Dr. Kim we were done and headed back to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
The next day Pablo had a conflict with another patient and I had to catch a taxi to the clinic for surgery day. This went smoothly as I had talked with the concierge the day before to let them know I would need a taxi. They asked where I was going and I pulled out the paper that Pablo had supplied with Yeson&#39;s address on it in Korean and they notated that so the next morning when I went down, the doorman asked my name and I was there for my taxi. I said yes and he motioned for the taxi to pull up. I got in and the doorman read off the address in Korean to the taxi driver when dutifully put it into his GPS and off we went. I arrived really early. 8:20 am for a 9am appointment. Yeson reception wasn&#39;t there yet but the door was open so I went in and sat down. They came in around 8:30. Jessie came and got me around 8:45 and took me to my private room to get changed and start prepping for surgery.
</p>
<p>
A skin test and IV was started, then meds were given through the IV. At first I had this huge rush of anxiety shortly there after and then got really calm and sleepy. I figure they were both side effects from the medications. No big deal. Dr Kim came in later to go over all possible complications from the surgery and to get your sign off. Then the anesthesiologist comes in for a quick sign off. The surgery room is right across the hall from the private rooms so when the time comes, they will walk you right over and lay you on the table, strap you down and the  anesthesiologist will place an oxygen mask on you and put something in the IV that feels cool going down your arm and the next thing you know you&#39;ll wake up back in your recovery room bed. How they got this big bawdy girl back over into that bed will forever be a mystery to me. Surgery probably started between 10 and 10:30am and I woke up around 12:15PM.
</p>
<p>
They had the heat turned up really high as you&#39;re usually cold when you wake up from anesthesia and the bed or blanket was heated as well. I woke up and dozed back off several times. I probably woke up for good about an hour later. They put a button around your neck that you can press if you need anything. The nurse came to check and I motioned that it was little too hot and she turned down the heat. You have to wait 2 hours after surgery to eat. They first brought 2 ice-creams which where very good and some water. About an hour later two bowls of pumpkin soup were supplied as well. It was my first time eating it but it was actually enjoyable. Think consistency of oatmeal.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after, Jessie came back and we went upstairs to go see Dr. Kim again. The camera went down the nose again and then you sit and discuss the results of your surgery and things to be cautious of. After that it was back down to floor 2 to the private room. There was one more round of IV meds and then right after you&#39;re given a bag of medications to take home with you and the IV is removed.  I was asked to change back into my street clothes at that point and that Pablo would come and get me soon to transport me back to the hotel. While waiting I had that same rush of anxiety and then later the calmness which is what makes me think it was a side effect of the IV meds. During the car ride back to the hotel I was so sleepy that I slept most of the way back.
</p>
<p>
Back at the hotel, I can straight back to my room, stripped and jumped right in the bed and slept for 10 hours strait.  Ive been up now for last 8 hours. Went and got breakfast this morning. Your throat doesn&#39;t hurt per se. It&#39;s more of an annoyance feeling and you want to clear your throat but know that you can&#39;t. It&#39;s a constant feeling. Drinking water does help, so I end up drinking tons of water. Part of the meds you get include packets of liquid cough medicine as well.
</p>
<p>
Monday will be the follow up visit. 5 days from surgery date. Pablo messaged that he would pick me up and we would first go to have a COVID test as I need that in order to board my flight back the US the next day (the US updated their requirement from 72 hours to just 24 hours before your departure time for a negative COVID test). After that we&#39;ll head back to Yeson for followup visit. I&#39;m sure it will involve the camera down the nose for the 3rd time and will also get the botox shot in the neck to help freeze the vocal muscles while things heal.
</p>
<p>
Then Pablo will also pick me up for my ride back to the airport for my flight tomorrow as well. The travel process will be interesting without being able to speak at all. I&#39;ve really enjoyed my trip here, outside of the requirement for quarantine, but that will be over probably by the time you read this. I do look forward to getting back home and back to the routine of life I guess :-)
</p>
<p>
I tried to be as detailed as possible and put all of things that I would have wanted to know to be comfortable with the entire process. If you have any questions feel free to ask below and I&#39;ll gladly share.
</p>
<p>
Until then I&#39;ll be sitting here in silence and waiting patiently for April 16 2022 in order to be able to speak again :-)

I&#39;d love to hear an update on how things went?  I&#39;d also love to know any travel or even procedure advice you may have?  I&#39;m scheduled for late January and have my trip booked at this point.

It turned out lovely. I haven&#39;t been clocked via voice not once since recovering from the surgery. It wasn&#39;t a &#34;magic pill&#34; that I totally changed my voice. It raised the overall range of my voice but I didn&#39;t completely lose my lower register. What it did do was to remove that &#34;wall&#34; or the amount of effort that it took to slip into my upper register and then made it such that I can stay there all day effortlessly. I prefer the technique that Dr. Kim does over what a lot of the doctors do here in the states. I&#39;ve heard many girls that have this artificially high sounding voice, or the common always &#34;slightly hoarse&#34; or &#34;thin&#34; sounding voice that still sounds like it takes a lot of effort. I just didn&#39;t want to take that chance and I&#39;m happy with my result.

Thanks for responding. I don’t know enough about the techniques to speak intelligently about it, but Dr Kim’s technique makes the most sense to me.

It&#39;s my pleasure to respond. Dr. Kim has been doing it for a long time and he pioneered the technique that he uses. When I was researching, I noticed on the website that it said it was the only feminization technique that lets you keep your singing voice. I&#39;m not a singer so I brushed right over this, but now looking back on it, I can understand why that was worth mentioning due to not ending up with an artificial sounding result.
