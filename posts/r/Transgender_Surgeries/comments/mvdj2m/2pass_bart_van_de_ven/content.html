FFS - My beautiful friend was just botched by him. After 6 months her nerves in her chin are so damaged she dribbles and cant eat properly. I want to offer her advice. Does anyone know where we can get help? She is in Europe. I read somewhere about nerve grafts..?

I&#39;ve been botched by Bart and I also dribble. Unfortunately, nerve damage cannot be repaired and nerve grafts don&#39;t always repair it to the point that it&#39;s  the same as before. I think it would only work if let&#39;s say the damage is pretty minor.

It is a serial butcher you should sue it and report it to the medical board or the police.

Update: Original response below was before I realized (via OP’s edit/update) that this was an FFS specific complication. OP updated to clarify that, so disregard the part about colons but still these few docs might be worth a call.
</p>
<p>
Following. I’m not sure which nerves can be grafted for this case. “Dribbles” I get, but eating issues seem a bit harder to explain without detail. I’m worried something else is going on. Maybe like a hernia?
</p>
<p>
If this was a colon vaginoplasty, then that would be an obvious example of a failure point related to eating.
</p>
<p>
Maybe talk to a gastric specialist?
</p>
<p>
I talked to Lee Dellon, he’s a peripheral nerve specialist here in the USA with offices in Maryland and Las Vegas. You can also try Dr. Bouman in Amsterdam and Dr. Monstrey in Gent.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps.

Thanks for clarification. When you said “dribbles” before I assumed you meant small amounts of urine leakage (not that uncommon, but nor is it in cis some) but was puzzled by the eating part unless it was a colonic section procedure. I’m editing my own post now too.
</p>
<p>
I will defer to others’ expertise for FFS though.

Nerve grafting is an option in specific cases, so a thorough consultation with a professional + imaging would have to be done to evaluate the damage and see what can be done. In some cases, nothing can be done, and in no case will it return fully to normal. Good news are still possible, and the faster nerve damage is addressed, the better the prognosis. It is imperative to consult a professional as soon as possible - lost time will likely affect healing negatively if grafting is possible.
