Much like with bottom surgery I was terrified to go under the knife because I was scared that I would either change too much or not enough.  Honestly I am enthralled with the results so far. Of course I have to take everything with a grain of salt because I still have a fair bit of swelling and will continue to have said swelling for the next 3-5 months. All in all though I am shocked at how simply removing (in the grand scheme of things) a surprisingly small amount of bone from my face has had such a massive impact on both how light hits my face and how I perceive my face in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, my German genetic lineage did not do me any favors in having a super slim slender supermodel face, but I&#39;m amazed. About 6.7mm of bone was removed from each side of my jaw (up to9 9mm in some places), my forehead was set back about 3mm and orbital contouring pushed by my eye brows by 2-3mm on average (up to 4.6 in some spots though)
</p>
<p>
Technical details aside I am blown away by the results. I don&#39;t cringe when I see myself in the mirror anymore and when I catch myself in the self cam while on a video chat I don&#39;t look away feeling bad I stare and I marvel at how much softer and more me my face has become.
</p>
<p>
Based on these results I&#39;m going to put in for some nose work and a little lip work but after that I&#39;m good.
</p>
<p>
This is the year of surgeries for me apparently. Stage 1 ffs, then top surgery, then minor stage 2 of ffs.
</p>
<p>
I am so very pleased with everything. Bigots would tell me that I would hate myself after getting surgeries but I only love myself more with each procedure. It&#39;s beautiful.
</p>

Edit: Also feel free to dm or ama. I&#39;ll likely post before and after pics once everything is done.

Sounds like you might have been the morning surgery with Dr. Liu 2 weeks ago. I’m also 2 weeks out with him. I’m loving my forehead but still tender when it comes to eyebrow  movement. I’m still so swollen from the lips down I’m still looking a little in-human. I didn’t have a ton of chin jaw bone removed just shaved smooth but I guess the whole surgery recovery is different for everyone. It’s still hard for me to speak because the combo of the pericranial lip grafts (too and bottom) with chin swelling makes everything hard. Had to take a 3rd week off work because I talk for most of my work. Also getting stage 2 done (nose) at the end of July with him. Good luck with the rest of your recovery and surgeries.

I have Dr. Liu on June 10th, and I&#39;m starting to plan the recovery phase. Any advice on things I might want to buy in advance? How long after surgery should I plan on having a caretaker?

Get Myralax and take that regularly as long as you&#39;re taking opioids. It&#39;s honestly far more pleasant to have the runs than post-op constipation. You&#39;ll need someone to help manage you for a day or two after surgery but I was up and attem the day after. Try to get out and walk a bit if you can, even if it&#39;s just down the street and back with some help.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you&#39;re eatting enough, it&#39;s really rough to get enough good quality food in you for a solid two weeks due to the swelling and lockjaw that follows jaw surgery if you&#39;re having that done. Greek yogurt with honey is a great source of healthy fats and proteins. Avoid things with bits in them. Pudding is a blessing, I thought Jello would be too but it was hard to chew.
</p>
<p>
I made sure to have ibuprophen and acetomenaphin to go with the hardcore painkillers. Ibuprophen for swelling and acetomenaphin for pain. I didn&#39;t really need the opioids for pain after 72 hours or so, but I used them at night to make sure I could sleep well.
</p>
<p>
All in all, pace yourself and know your limits. If you have any questions or concerns reach out to Dr. Liu, he&#39;s very responsive.
</p>
<p>
If there&#39;s anything else I missed, I&#39;m happy to answer.
