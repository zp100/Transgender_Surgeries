I just got off the phone with a coordinator at UAB. My consultation in July was cancelled because Selph is leaving UAB to go to a private practice in Nashville, no other information.
</p>
<p>
The patient coordinator said she would provide contact info for Selph at his new practice when it&#39;s available but for now consults are being cancelled. If you are trying to see Selph, you will not be able to schedule with him through UAB.

I&#39;m late to the thread. I&#39;m one of his current patients, following him up to Nashville. He&#39;ll be at the Cool Springs location of Urology Associates, technically in Franklin, TN. He&#39;s definitely still going to be doing surgeries, and his first day at the new office is going to be August 1. You should be able to call (615-771-3024) and get scheduled now. All of this was directly from him at my last follow up appointment in May.

The practice seems to have a telephone number for a central phone bank, plus telephone numbers for each branch office. I called the one I posted, but I&#39;ve heard other numbers from other of Dr. Selph&#39;s previous patients that I know from my local community.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I had my first appointment at the new practice this week. Everything went pretty smoothly, and they&#39;d received the fax from UAB with my previous records. I&#39;m waiting on further surgeries with Dr. Selph until after I get a surgery I need for overall health done. I&#39;m supposed to get in touch with the practice once I&#39;m healed from that, and we&#39;ll get everything set up for my next steps with him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had a lot of complications, but it&#39;s almost certainly my body. I have hEDS with a lot of skin involvement. I&#39;m in the middle of metoidioplasty, urethral lengthening, scrotoplasty, and testicular implants.
</p>
<p>
Wound separation because of my skin has added surgeries to the original plan. Also, he&#39;s broken the steps down into more surgeries with less at a time and altered his suture techniques for me after the first bottom surgery, where we realized just how problematic my skin is. This combo has really helped me heal better than the standard way to do it.
