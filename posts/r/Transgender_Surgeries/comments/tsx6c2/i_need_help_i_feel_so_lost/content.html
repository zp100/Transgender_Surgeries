Thanks, I added this to the wiki.

Probably a bit risky choosing him for FFS in normal circumstances, but glad to hear it worked out so well. Given the unusual range of surgeries he does I expect he&#39;s far more adventurous than other surgeons and would be a good option for those who need such things.

Its up to you ofc ... on HRT there can be a builddown of muscles, which can make for a change in shape. Giving HRT some time first may be recommendable. And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/presentation/index" rel="nofollow">here</a>
in the first link might be some hints concerning presentation. Many cis people with a triangular shape also have those issues and it may be an idea to look up a few things that people use.
</p>
<p>
And there is a service called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ucqeo/virtual_ffs_experiences/e93gg97/" rel="nofollow">virtualFFS</a>
and consulting them in case may be a good idea. They also know surgeons. It may be necessary to discuss with them the kind of approach though. A standard may be a moderate approach. Be aware that with a more aggressive approach results can look more mask like, and less individual.
</p>
<p>
They could make a few suggestions including a minimal one. More details are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/ffs/introduction#wiki_virtual_ffs" rel="nofollow">here</a>
.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/support/index#wiki_connecting_to_others" rel="nofollow">here</a>
might be some hints concerning looking for support and there are also resources there concerning looking for a gender therapist in case.
