I am going to be as sensitive as possible. That surgeon needs to be sued (by you) &amp; have his license revoked. This type of work after 9 hours under is unacceptable. Luckly it is salvageable, but as you said a revision is out of the question.
</p>
<p>
How to work around living with the results? I would say you need a very strong support system (friends, family etc).

Thank you for your compassion! I wish there was a way to find money to go to Djorjevic and to convince my fiancée that this is not just a cosmetic whim but a necessity. She hates surgeries and gets very dramatic. When I mentioned that I might need a revision and she said she cannot handle another shock.

You can tell her that revisions are less invasive.  Some are even done under local anesthesia, but I doubt you will.   I’m sorry that u had to go thru this.  The doctor is a hack.

I will tell her that. In the end, we&#39;re talking only about labiaplasty. I hope that after some time passes, she will be more agreeable...

This is not an acceptable result. Fortunately, you have a lot of material left with to work with for a revision. I would not let that surgen near me with a 10 foot pole.

Thank you! Unfortunately, as I said, even if I decide to have a revision, I cannot pay for it even after 20 years if I start saving everything I can from today... and I and it would also mean losing my fiancée...

If you did just a labiaplasty it would be considerably cheaper than your vaginoplasty. And I’m unsure about your insurance, but at least in the US, surgeons sometimes are able to get labiaplasties covered.

If there is a way to get a revision, I will go to Djorjevic. But there is no way to get money and I don&#39;t know how to convince my fiancée that the revision is a necessity, not a cosmetic whim... now it seems impossible.

I have never seen a result like this. The good news is, there does seem to be a ton of material left to work with. I think a competent surgeon could still give you a very good result, but please don’t let that doctor ever work on you again. I am very sorry, but you are correct that they did a very bad job.

Thank you for your comment! For sure, I wouldn&#39;t have a revision with this doctor. I already have good surgeon in mind but I don&#39;t think I will ever have the money for such a thing...

Thanks! I won&#39;t go to him for sure. The thing is that I can&#39;t find money to go to a skilled surgeon like Djordjevic and I cannot convince my fiancée that I need a revision and it&#39;s not just a pretention.

Honey, I am so sorry this happened to you. You truly did not deserve this. I truly wish there was a way for you to get a revision from another surgeon. You deserve to get some satisfactory results, especially after 9 full hours of surgery. If there is anyway that you can sue, please do. What about setting up a GoFundMe for the costs of the lawsuit and maybe a revision if every you&#39;d be willing to get one. This is absolutely unacceptable to get as results. You really deserve better.

Thank you for your compassion! I don&#39;t see any point in dealing with lawsuits - I don&#39;t need any more stress I already have. I would rather focus on finding how to get money for a revision elsewhere and how to convince my fiancée that a revision is really a necessity because now she thinks it&#39;s just a cosmetic whim.

I thought about what to write about it. First of all, I would like to say that I am sorry that the result did not meet your expectations. Regarding your questions, I actually think that the symmetry is basically there, the finishing touches are missing. I think you have a clit hood. My honest advice is to look at the result again in 6 and 9 months, there can still be a lot to do visually.

Thank you so much for your input! For sure, I will wait for several months more before judging the situation but still I am not sure it would improve enough so it doesn&#39;t cause me dysphoria. I hope I am wrong...

There are 3 surgeons in the Czech republic that do SRS and from my research neither one is very good. Brno, Ostrava and Prague. I live in Prague and even though health insurance would cover the whole price of the surgery in the Czech republic, I’ve rather decided to spend my life savings and have the surgery abroad. I’m sorry this happened to you. The quality and accessibility of trans healthcare here is dreadful.

Good that you have the option to save enough for a decent surgery. For me it was not possible so I guess this is still better than nothing...

Well yeah, I do feel lucky to have this option, even though it’s gonna eat up all my savings and bye bye mortgage. It’s just sad how bad the quality of the surgeries is here and that the insurance refuses to help out with financing the surgeries abroad.

I was actually born in Bulgaria but I emigrated to the Czech Republic. I don&#39;t even want to start explaining how much better everything here is, compared to Bulgaria but I guess I had too high expectations about this field...

Where did you have the surgery and how much did it cost? Are you happy with the result?

I understand that. But to be fair, Bulgaria probably doesn’t set the bar to high 😬 I think Czech republic still has a long way to go in trans rights and healthcare. I didn’t have the surgery yet, getting it later this year in Lisbon, Portugal woth Dr. Littleton. And it’s 19k euros 🥲
