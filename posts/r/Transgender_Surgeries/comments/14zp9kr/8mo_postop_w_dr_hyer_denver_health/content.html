Hello!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure a lot of you saw all my reposts the other day, apologies for that. However, this is an actual new post in regards to my journey with PI vaginoplasty with Dr. Hyer at Denver Health.
</p>
<p>
So, as the title says I&#39;m currently at 8 months post-op. Overall, I&#39;m happy that the worst parts of the recovery are over and I&#39;ve been able to kind of just live life normally and do whatever these days. Function wise, everything &#34;works&#34; and I have no issues. Appearance and minor complications wise, there are some things to address.
</p>
<p>
I have a revision on the 1st of August this year to address the remaining erectile tissue in my labia, as seen in slides 6, 7 and 9 - the swollen/bulbous area. I&#39;m hoping after the removal, things will rest normally. Due to it&#39;s bulbous nature, it kind of pushes open my labia in a way that looks awkward when squatting/other positions. We will also be reopening my clitoral hood as that got covered up during the initial stages of healing. I think after these two things are addressed, the overall appearance and &#34;resting state&#34; of my vagina will look more natural/appealing for me. This revision will be with Dr. Hyer as she is the most available option for me right now, and I just really want these things addressed as soon as I can.
</p>
<p>
The only other thing I want to address at a later date, is how things look when I fully spread my legs, as seen in slide 3. My labia seem to just disappear when I do this, which I don&#39;t really enjoy. I will probably address that
<em>
much
</em>
later as it&#39;s not the most dire by my own needs compared to the former two I mentioned. The only other potential thing I may do is a revision to PPT. Outside of this, I&#39;m okay with how things look for the most part.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, some other issues I&#39;ve personally been dealing with are consistent BV and granulation tissue. Both of which have limited my ability to have vaginal sex, sadly. I&#39;ve only tried and &#34;succeeded&#34; in vaginal sex like three times total, each time being relatively painful. The granulation tissue will be addressed in my revision. As far as the BV, I believe there is a biofilm inside my canal that I am now addressing and treating, and
<em>
hopefully
</em>
, that will be the end of that issue as it&#39;s been incredibly hard for me emotionally dealing with this for 5 months now.
</p>
<p>
I think that&#39;s all I have to say as of right now. I&#39;ll be posting again after my revision, and then again once that&#39;s all healed up or when my 1 year comes around, whichever comes first. At that point, I probably won&#39;t be updating anymore as I&#39;d like to just move forward with things in life. My DM&#39;s will always be open though to those seeking any info about my journey!
</p>
<p>
As always, feel free to ask any questions! â™¡

i would, yes. not only a different surgeon but also PPT method instead. but i cant really change that now so it doesnt matter. im set for a revision with dr hyer in june for aesthetics, as well as erectile tissue removal and clitoral hood opening. i had planned to go to a separate surgeon for a revision, but life circumstances have changed a lot and i wont have the ability to go elsewhere and at this point id rather just get a revision from her to get these issues resolved as opposed to waiting even longer.
</p>
<p>
this surgery was extremely difficult both physically and mentally, and im just ready to move on with my life haha

At this stage how do you feel about Dr. Hyer as a surgeon?

Overall, I think she could work on/advance her techniques when it comes to the appearance of her results. Maybe that&#39;s just personal preference and others would be okay with my results appearance wise, but personally I would have liked a different outcome.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, I feel she should follow-up with her patients more from 6 months and out, as she does not have a big library of post-op results beyond that point. In fact, at least when I had my consultation, her post-op results library was very small. A max of 5 people, if I recall correctly. I think that should&#39;ve alarmed me to potentially consider other surgeons. Alas, I can&#39;t change that now.
</p>
<p>
Outside of that, I think she&#39;s a good surgeon.

I wonder who taught her?  Marci has trained a lot of the newer surgeons.  Thanks for sharing results and info btw.
