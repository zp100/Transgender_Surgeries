Hi, are there any people who have had SRS / GRS with Miroslav L. Djordjevic at the Belgrade Centre?
</p>
<p>
I am considering him specifically for PPV surgery as there are not many options outside of the USA. So any general experience of his work would be good, and even better would be anyone who has done the PPV.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks :-)

Thanks. It seems there is a decent number of members. Have you joined VK? Do you know if the group is any good?

I recently deleted myself from their bc it took too much time, but I’ll probably revive the my page again soon. About the group, it’s mostly them describing their work and advertising

I wrote an earlier post about my phone consult with him.. Supposed to have consult at Mt Sinai in NY.   He typically does a partial PPV with inversion. Costs around 13,500 euros. He hasn&#39;t done as many as other types though.

I was told he has done about 40+ of the PPV type and obviously lots of the more traditional PI surgery.
