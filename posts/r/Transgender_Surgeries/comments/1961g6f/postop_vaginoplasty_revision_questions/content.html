I have two questions
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
What options for revisions were made available to you
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do you or anyone have experience with the &#34;mesh&#34; used for surgical revisions of a periotneal pull through?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For context, I&#39;m considering a revision. I got a periotneal pull through vaginoplasty by Dr. Shubham Gupta out of University Hospitals in Cleveland 2 years ago.
</p>
<p>
Overall the experience and outcome were decent, but I struggled with my recovery because of scar tissue and pain. I ended up losing almost all of my depth and width to the point where I could round down and say I have a zero depth vagina. But in actuality I can take a finger. But only one.
</p>
<p>
The two options available to me are a colon transplant, and a mesh.
</p>
<p>
The colon transplant is pretty well known at this point so I will skip it, but if you have experience with one of those, I&#39;m happy to hear how your recovery, width, and depth has been. I am also curious about the &#34;15 to 20 years of usable life&#34; it is claimed to have. I&#39;m 37, so I would want it to last longer than that.
</p>
<p>
The mesh however, acts like a latus would for plants. They reform the opening and canal, and use the mesh like they would for a hernia. The periotneal tissue (now the vagina) grows over it to regain lost width and depth. If there is a vast amount of area to reclaim, they will do a skin graft from the inside of the cheek.
</p>
<p>
Do any of you have any experience with this?
</p>
<p>
They are using some pretty new methods. The old mesh was Integra, but the new one isn&#39;t and I don&#39;t have any info on it yet.
</p>
<p>
This has been extremely hard for me, so I&#39;m trying not to give up and keep pushing forward.
</p>
<p>
I really wish I could just tell them to grow one using my stem cells.

Dr. Devin Obrien-Coons, who is currently at BWH in Boston, was part of a research team that did a study on growing a vaginal canal using patient stem cells. It was successful in the small study they conducted a while back.

Did you hear anything about what options they went with for their procedure or technical details about them?

she kept me updated throughout the process. basically the surgeon and urologist (person who operates the robot) did a physical exam. i think that she had a ct or mri.
</p>
<p>
they commonly do ppt and basically added (about) 1&#34; depth to her pi. she only stayed at the hospital one night and went home next day.
</p>
<p>
a person is limited by their physiology: she is only 5&#39;5&#34; (-ish). short stature, shorter torso (she has 6&#34;-6.25&#34; now. my other girlfriend who 6&#39;1&#34; got about 8&#34;, but she is tall and has a longer torso. (she had colon graft.)
</p>
<p>
the robot &#34;sees inside the torso&#34; so they can create maximum depth for your body type. same with a revision. she chose these surgeons because she knew that she wanted a ppt for her revision.
</p>
<p>
she had 2 plastic surgeons that she wanted to do the revi. the one that she went with (keith in nj) was able to get her an appointment faster because she has been a patient of the uro. her other choice was bluebond-langer; there was a 2 year waiting list for her at the time.

15-20years usable life with sigmoid? That&#39;s a first I&#39;m hearing of that.
</p>
<p>
Where did that come from?

I&#39;ll try to dig up the link again. It was from a video interview with someone I believe is a clinician. Not sure of his credentials. I took the statement at face value.

Cause if I&#39;m not mistaken, it&#39;s not like people poop out their sigmoid canal after 20 years. So what would make it just like cease in this case.

That&#39;s what gets me, is the lack of follow up to that statement. But transplanted organs and tissues do have a reputation of not lasting forever. But usually that is because there is more going on.

But it&#39;s not a transplanted organ or tissue. It&#39;s a repurpused organ or tissue from the body that made it.

It&#39;s an autograph. But like I said, the statement didn&#39;t make any sense to me either and it wasn&#39;t followed up with anything before the subject changed
