</p>
<p>
The last few days have been pretty full, and I&#39;ve been trying to find time to put my experiences in writing. Unfortunately, some of the details are foggy since my brain isn&#39;t at 100%.
</p>
<h1>
Day 6:
</h1>
<p>
Not a lot to say about Sunday. I was woken up a few times during the night with pain. Ice and pain killers, and I got back to sleep. I had my second bowel movement in the morning. It was a way less intense experience than the first one, the stool softeners were doing their job, and things were much less formed. I had also been feeling a building sense of pressure that I couldn&#39;t place, clearly not my bowels anymore. I thought that some of it was swelling and some was packing. I think I had a few naps, and I visited with my wife over lunch.
</p>
<h1>
Day 7:
</h1>
<p>
This was a very, very big day. And I was still getting woken up by pain at night. I had my first follow-up appointment at WCH to get my packing and catheter out, and start dilation. I took an uber from ARC to WCH, and found that it wasn&#39;t anywhere nearly as bad as when I moved from WCH to ARC last week. I made it from the main entrance to the 5th floor under my own power, something I wouldn&#39;t have imagined doing last week. I had another new experience today, my feet in the stirrups of the exam table while wearing a hospital gown and nothing else below the waist.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t remember 100% in which order Emery took the packing and catheter out. I wasn&#39;t sure what the packing coming out would feel like. I&#39;d taken pain meds before coming over, since I&#39;d heard from some women that it could hurt. For me it just felt really weird, like something was unfolding inside me piece by piece and I was getting emptier and emptier as each little bit crunched, unfolded, and pulled out. I had no idea how much internal pressure I&#39;d been feeling from the packing until it was gone, and it was a huge relief. The cath coming out made me yelp in pain, but it was over quickly (I&#39;d been catheterized before, and taking it out then took a lot longer, but I&#39;d only had it in for a day so it hurt less (more like a hiss than a yelp).) I&#39;d had the cath in for a week, and apparently it hadn&#39;t been draining freely the whole time, I had a pretty full bladder when they removed it, and I felt like I needed to pee for the rest of the appointment. They also recommended that I don&#39;t try to super hydrate since it would really suck if I couldn&#39;t pee.
</p>
<p>
Dilation was next, and Celeste walked me through the whole process of lubing the dilator up, and applying nidagel to the tip. She did the first insertion, having me focus on deep relaxed breaths, and relaxing my pelvic floor muscles. There were some painful spots going in, and she paused each time to let me adjust and the pain to die down. After getting it fully in, she kept it there for a few minutes before slowly removing it. Emery did an exam using a transparent speculum, and everything looked fine, with some very minor separation near the perineum. Celeste then walked me through getting the dilator ready again, and inserting it myself. It was easier the second time, I think both from just having had it inside me, and from having total control of it. Relaxation seems to be the key.
</p>
<p>
We touched base about my calf and my hemorrhoids (which flared the fuck up after my first BM), so I now get to add a suppository to my med routine, but it will make it stop burning when I poop, so its definitely a worthwhile trade-off. After the appointment I went straight to the nearest bathroom and peed for the first time since surgery. Having a full bladder helped, I think, since all I had to do was relax and let the flow start. I was then treated to a warm bath of my underside. Emery had warned me that it&#39;d be much more spray than stream out of the gate, and they were right. It felt fantastic to not need to worry about getting untucked and make sure it was pointed down anymore, just sit down and spray.&#39;
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, I headed downstairs to fill my prescription and then back to ARC. While waiting for my prescription, I discovered that sitting had gotten less painful, though still not something I wanted to do without extreme care. After getting back to ARC, my wife texted me that she was getting lunch, and asked if I would be up for joining her. I think that if I&#39;d had cath and packing in, the answer would have definitely been no, but I decided to go for it since I was feeling good. I took an uber over to the House on Parliament, where I got to have some very well executed pub fare and spend some quality time with my wife and daughter. I took an uber back and sort of staggered into bed for a rest, and then my first solo dilation.
</p>
<p>
My first solo dilation was almost anticlimactic; insertion was easier than first dilation, and I was more comfortable in my bed at ARC than on the exam table at WCH. One intense moment came when I took the dilator out and my PF muscles had a WTF moment with nothing in my vagina. It was an intense feeling of emptiness, which hasn&#39;t repeated since.
</p>
<p>
I also got to take my first shower since surgery. One week without a shower was a stretch, and washing felt so nice. Letting the water flow down over my vulva was a very different feeling to before, and it felt so nice not having a penis hanging out there.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, dinner and third dilation were uneventful. I think I had a nap in there somewhere, but I&#39;m not certain.
</p>
<h1>
Day 8:
</h1>
<p>
My first full day of solo dilation, I found that it took me about an hour to set up, dilate, tear down, and clean up. I&#39;ll probably get faster with time. I also had to update my travel plans back home. I had misunderstood when my second post-op followup would be back in September, and booked things to go back on the Tuesday 2 weeks after surgery as opposed to the Friday 2 weeks after surgery. Via customer service was very helpful in getting things sorted out though, so no major problems there. Not really a particularly memorable day, other than lunch with my wife and daughter. Yay! I also hit a pain management trough while visiting with them, so it wiped me out for a bit afterwards.
</p>
<h1>
Day 9:
</h1>
<p>
I&#39;ve been feeling tired all day since I haven&#39;t had a good chance for a nap, and I have yet to have an uninterrupted night&#39;s sleep. I&#39;m still waking up to a pain around my clitoris that yanks me out of sleep and then very slowly fades. I&#39;m also tired of sleeping on my back. Fortunately, I have a powered bed, so I&#39;m in more of a jackknife position, which avoids a stretch across my pubic mound and takes some pressure off my knees.
</p>
<p>
I got my first dilation out of the way before breakfast, and had my nap interrupted by a fire drill. Evacuating the building very slowly by stairs (we&#39;re on the 3rd floor) wasn&#39;t exactly painful, but standing up for a while isn&#39;t exactly pleasant as pressure builds. I also didn&#39;t have the opportunity to manage my pain in advance, so I felt rather weary by the time I was able to get back upstairs and lie down for a bit to relieve the pressure.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was fine, and I got my second dilation in, and took pain meds afterwards. Then I headed out for a walk to the gardens with my wife (there&#39;s a botanical garden in the park across the street), it was the most walking I&#39;ve done since surgery, and I probably pushed a bit too hard. But, I would say it was totally worth it. Getting out, smelling the orchids, and seeing the turtles was a nice change from being inside, seeing our daughter experience the garden was great too.
</p>
<p>
Dinner was chicken parmesan, and reminiscing with one of the other women about when our kids were newborns (the memory of holding your daughter in one arm just plain sticks with you.) Lots of baby photos later and some pain meds again, and I&#39;m lying here writing part of this post before my third dilation. Third dilation was a bit harder than the first two today, it took me longer to really relax all of my pelvic muscles and hit full depth, but otherwise pretty boring.
</p>
<p>
I go off of the prescription NSAID tomorrow and back to regular Ibuprofen, still taking Tylenol regularly, and opioids as needed. And now I&#39;m caught up, and just waiting for my final Tylenol of the day before I go to sleep. Hopefully I sleep well. One night, just one night. Please?

I think it would be a good idea to edit your posts and link them together so that people can find them all more easily.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve added them to the
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/canada/content.md" rel="nofollow">wiki</a>
</p>
<p>
Also mention that these surgeons are in Canada.

Good idea, I&#39;ll see what I can do.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Done, I&#39;ve created an index post and linked all the posts back to it.
