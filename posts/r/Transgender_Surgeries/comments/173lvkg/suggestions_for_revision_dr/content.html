Look into Jess Ting. He has experience doing revisions on former Rumer patients and was also part of a lawsuit against Rumer

I don’t, but he could definitely show you some at the consult. Might be something in the wiki but not sure

I think looking at The butcher’s wiki section there are revisions results on the wiki. I think this post will help
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/s/qafGguHDRs" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/s/qafGguHDRs</a>
I will be posting my result soon, i had surgery with Rumer in 2018 and have got a revision with Dr. Ting 3 weeks ago. During my consultation I had to specifically ask to see a picture. Unsure if it was of a previous rumer pt. or not. He told me he has done 30+ revisions of hers. You can DM if you want. Going through this alone is scary.

I too would suggest Dr. Ting.   He’s all to familiar and has been able to help correct Rumeritis.

I’m looking for further cosmetic revisions too— I had a mid revision from Jun a couple years ago. But not much advice beyond considering Wittenberg, Ley, Theerapong, maybe Satterwhite from his photos.
</p>
<p>
Jun performed  a PPT revision graft on me too. I would advise against the PPT graft and go colon. It offers more depth. Mine is like 4 inches now at most and it’s tight. But also could’ve been Jun’s skill, he was newer at the time. I’m looking into other docs to see if I can get a colon graft.

No I did not 😭 please don’t speak for me. my initial surgery actually looked okay- but I formed an infection 3 weeks out, developed pretty bad necrosis and my initial surgeon did a shitty revision. And I had some erectile tissue left as well but not this severe

I recommend Dr. Theerapong (from Thailand), He is very good with aesthetics and revision surgeries, I saw that you also have problems with vaginal depth  and that could be remedied with the sigmoid colon technique (the technique he does the most)

I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve had such a harrowing journey! I just wanted to comment regarding the location of your clitoris. It&#39;s perfectly normal to not have
<strong>
clitoral
</strong>
stimulation during intercourse and your clitoris appears anatomically correct to me... the other consideration is that revision of the clitoris would run the risk of
<strong>
reduced
</strong>
sensation. For these reasons, I think that you&#39;ll have a hard time finding a surgeon who thinks a clitoral revision is a good idea... I say this because I don&#39;t want you to rule out a potentially good surgeon just because you feel they don&#39;t want to address your concerns about the location of your clitoris. That said, I hear your concerns and it seems like the erectile issue is really bothersome for you... and I&#39;m sure you can find a great surgeon to help you!

I definitely understand that risk and that’s why it’s third on my list to overall aesthetic and functional issues however Dr Bowers and Dr RBL also agreed with me that the placement is too high so I know that it was placed in a non anatomically correct position. I’m not hopeful that it can be corrected though just wishing that it could be done I guess.

Try again, this was because she was originally moving to Align Surgical next year aka no new bookings at GCC. But she ended up staying, I’m getting another round scheduled with her (labia touch up after her successful revision of my failed original surgery).

No, she moved to the Gender Confirmation Center (GCC) in San Francisco last year and then almost left for Align. She’s likely staying at GCC.

Be on the fence about her no longer. Any surgeon that needs to hire right wing ex trump affiliated lawyers to silence their own patients is no ally of our community.

<p>
<strong>
Dr. Kathy Rumer’s atrocities and disregard for the safety and well being of her patients include but are not limited to:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Rumer’s staff ignore the patient&#39;s chart, prescribe medication which could be fatal to the patient.

<p>
Rumer botches FTM patient, Rumer’s staff frequently misgendered the patient.

Dr. Rumer attempts to silence two of her low income trans patients through a SLAPP suit. Rumer used a right-wing affiliated transphobic legal team and brought the case before an anti-LGBTQ Trump appointed judge.
