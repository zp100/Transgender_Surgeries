I&#39;m like 8mo post op. My vagina has seen a few complications and granulation tissue has been a constant struggle.
</p>
<p>
But one thing in particular that&#39;s been a huge nuisance has been discharge. Discharge or just in general leaking. Sometimes it&#39;s bloody cause of granulation tissue. Other times it&#39;s stinky because who-knows.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been wearing liners and thin pads to help, but I hope for a day to come that these things aren&#39;t necessary and I can go back to just panties against my bare skin. Does it ever end?

I just had my pre surgery appointment for the revision and my surgeon told me my leakage is definitely not normal and he found out why (granulation tissue) and they are going to help with it in the 2nd surgery, so I would say the vagina should stop at some point except if something isn&#39;t right and that might need a consultation with your surgeon

<p>
For clarification, 7 months post op and German advanced PI method

It&#39;s called combined method were it&#39;s not a simple PI.
</p>
<p>
They use * Scrotal tissue for vagina and labia majora * Penile tissue for labia minora outer side and vagina entrance * Foreskin for labia minora innere side * Urethra lining between clitoris and urethra (technique 1) or inside the vagina (technique 2)

Not only penile in the vagina, so possible more feeling, possibility of getting wet thanks to urethra lining, better labia minora and majors thanks to more penile material, more realistic labia minora thanks to foreskin. (Don&#39;t know the exact procedure of the old PI)

Can&#39;t really help with the specifics on the cause or likely duration - that is probably something you need to ask your surgeon about.  It will also depend somewhat on the type of vaginoplasty that you had.
</p>
<p>
One thing I can suggest, if the liners and pads are bothering you because of texture/skin reaction/additional waste stream then you could look into buying some &#39;period panties&#39;.  These are made with a more absorbent crotch and might be enough on their own to handle the current level of discharge.  This would likely be more comfortable and feel better against your skin.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!  ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

Iâ€™m four months post op and I always wear a panty liner just in case. Constant dilating mean constant leaking. Even douching doesnâ€™t get everything out. Plus you are probably self lubricating a little bit too, I think most women probably wear a panty liner or something just in case.

I would assume it either from granulation tissue or minor infection? But once that is sorted and you hit the year mark youâ€™ll notice a HUGE difference. I only have discharge when I sweat. 2y post op.

I am not post OP so disregard if you want, however my research indicated being by design a moist enviroment and depending on the particular type of surgery you got, the leaking could persist indefinately. Ofc as you heal it should lessen and be less gross/smelly but its perferctly common for any woman some more than others. Id say go with the panty liners ans hope for the best but assume it can be a long term thing
