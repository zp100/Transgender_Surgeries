Will get it out of the way that my chest is a mass of bandages so I have no pictures yet. Eventually I&#39;ll have a before/after. But for now, if you want to learn about the process I went through, etc, I can only really answer about that.
</p>
<p>
Also, the implants are smooth, round 340cc silicone &#34;MemoryGel(tm) moderate classic profile&#34; implants. In case you were wondering.

update 1: before and after pictures:
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/X3fvSp0">https://imgur.com/a/X3fvSp0
</a>
at 10 and 20 days. Forgive the watermarking, I am just trying to keep things educational here ü§£
</p>
<p>
update 2: I&#39;m almost at full recovery point. I&#39;ve had a few &#34;spitting sutures&#34; on one side, which has complicated the recovery a little bit. Its when your body rejects some of the internal sutures placed during the surgery, and pushes them out the incision. They gave me a big surprise! I almost thought it was an infection, but apparently this just happens sometimes.
</p>
<p>
The nurses helped me through it and have really been an awesome help. They know exactly what to do and are super nice and explained everything in a way I could understand.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the recovery has been really easy and not very painful. I gotta hand it to them, they did a really good job with the surgery. I&#39;m quite satisfied.

Congrats! Was getting approved by Kaiser difficult?  What sort of requirements did they have (time on HRT, size before, etc)? Thanks for sharing.

For sure, and thank you!
</p>
<p>
Getting approved on the psychology/therapist letter was easy. I had already gotten approval for bottom surgery, which only took a couple meetings with 2 therapists, which I was able to get rather quickly. That process took ~3 months from the start (but the entire bottom surgery process takes &gt;2 years), but I didn&#39;t go about requesting top surgery until almost a year later.
</p>
<p>
I think the requirement for being on hormones is about 2 years, but I didn&#39;t look into this because I had been on so long.
</p>
<p>
So at that point I had some pictures taken, and I was initially told I wouldn&#39;t qualify, but they wanted me to come in anyway just in case. Apparently the criteria they look for are tanner staging and position of the nipples, rather than any specific size. I didn&#39;t qualify for the tanner staging requirement because I had already had advanced (but still quite small) breast development. But they called me in for an exam anyway, and ended up approving me. It was about a month between those initial pictures and this in-person exam.
</p>
<p>
They asked me if I wanted to get on the cancellation list and I said yes. Literally the next day (Nov 2) they called me about a cancellation for the November 25, and that was when I had surgery! Only 3 weeks from being approved. But obviously COVID-19 had a big effect on scheduling, who knows what it would have been like in more ordinary circumstances.

Overall, it took a couple months to get the requisite therapy appointments to get letters of approval. Because I am trying for bottom surgery, I needed 2, but I think only 1 is needed for BA. And I think I needed to be on HRT for at least 2 years. Once I had the letters, I had a consult where they took pictures and sent to a doctor I was assigned to. We then had a phone call a couple weeks later, and he told me to come into the office for an exam. It seemed like I might not have gotten approved. As I said above though, it did come through in that visit. At that point I was put on the cancellation list and got scheduled for 3 weeks later the following day. So if I tried to boil that down into a timeline
</p>
<p>
2 months - get letters
</p>
<p>
1 month - get consult
</p>
<p>
1 month - second consult
</p>
<p>
1 month - surgery
</p>
<p>
I have no idea how much this is luck, as opposed to being representative. YMMV

Also, they mentioned I could get a second opinion if I was denied, but I don&#39;t know how long that might have taken, because I didn&#39;t end up trying to do that.

I&#39;m in SoCal too and just got hired with a job that partners with Kaiser.

How have they been to work with? Any resistance with SRS/FFS?

I mentioned some details about the process in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/k15x5p/anyone_have_experience_with_kaiser/gdpdb1j/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" rel="nofollow">this thread
</a>
.  But overall, they&#39;ve been okay. I&#39;ve been approved for bottom surgery (SRS) but I&#39;m still waiting to finish hair removal (its been more than a year).
</p>
<p>
My sense overall with Kaiser is that they try to fit everyone into a box, and take personal preference second to their &#34;standardized&#34; practice. However, that practice runs relatively smoothly, even thought its requirements are strict. It&#39;s quite nice that everyone is referred in-house and you don&#39;t usually have to worry about insurance, they do all that behind the scenes. I think it has ups and downs. At times I&#39;ve felt talked town to by doctors and gatekeepers, but the system has worked out in the end for me. But I&#39;m also a very standard transsexual, I imagine its much more challenging for non-binary folks.

Haha, it seems like our conversations are overlapping!
</p>
<p>
You mentioned pictures of your chest before your BA. Do they require (or try to make you feel obligated) pictures for bottom?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry about how they&#39;ve treated you, that&#39;s aggravating. And also a little worrying given that we&#39;re trusting them with something so intimate and personal. I don&#39;t want someone with such an obvious bias or prejudice working on me.
</p>
<p>
Do you mind if I ask why it&#39;s taken so long for your hair removal?
</p>
<p>
Also, if you need support while in LA don&#39;t hesitate to reach out!

Electrolysis just takes a really long time. Like over a hundred hours over 2 years. Its pretty painful, so doing longer than 2-3 hours at a time is really challenging. They require basically 100% of hair to be removed from the surgical area.
</p>
<p>
They never took pictures of my genitals. They did an initial exam down there and that took like 1 minute. I don&#39;t know what exactly they were checking for, but whatever it is, they approved me.
</p>
<p>
Haha, thanks for the offer! :)

I don&#39;t want to wait 2 years! [throws tranny-tantrum]
</p>
<p>
I have a high pain tolerance (I have to consciously stop myself from moaning while getting tattooed) so I should be lucky in that regard. Although, as I write this I&#39;m curious as to what HRT has done to my pain tolerance.
</p>
<p>
No pictures required. Wonderful. I hope that doesn&#39;t change closer to operation date. Crisis averted.
</p>
<p>
No worries hon, guess it&#39;s odd since we are complete strangers.. but I mean, if you need that Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s during recovery, I got you.

mileage varies. Depends on how much hair you have, your pain tolerance, etc. I have some tips for shortening it.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
2 weeks before your first appointment, have the area waxed. Helps get rid of dormant hairs that can&#39;t be killed. You might want to wax regularly (every few months) if you aren&#39;t getting full clearings. This is because only hairs that are currently growing can be killed.
<br>
</li>
<li>
You want to get a &#34;full clearing&#34; (i.e. all the hair is gone) as quickly as possible. This means that all the growing hairs have been destroyed, and you&#39;re just waiting for the next round of dormant hairs to enter a growing phase. So in other words, like as many hours as you can handle. Then wait a few weeks and repeat. Rather than one or two hours a week, this will probably speed it up considerably. Total number of hours in electrolysis is probably the same, but this shortens the overall timeline.
</li>
<li>
Drink lots of water the day before. Take a painkiller and cover the area with lidocaine cream, or EMLA if you can get a prescription, and then cover the cream with plastic wrap so it doesnt soak into your clothes
</li>
<li>
Check the paper with the requirements for hair removal that they give you and tell your electrologist to stick to it and not waste time removing hairs they don&#39;t need to remove. saves time and pain.
</li>
<li>
If given the choice, you want &#34;blend electrolysis&#34; instead of pure heat &#34;thermolysis&#34; or pure electricity &#34;galvanic&#34; - this tends to be most effective IME. they like thermolysis because its quick, but the hairs grow back more easily than with blend, which has the highest kill rate.
</li>
</ol>

oh and tell them to crank up the setting as high as you can handle without burning your skin. also increases the kill rate. unpleasant but effective

I want to add that even the BA clinic was a one-size-fits-all deal. They didn&#39;t ask for much input on what the implant size would be. I had to assert that I wanted smaller breasts. They did deliver on that, but they never committed to it before the surgery. And they only gave me the lower end of a range they set prior. I felt a little steamrolled, but I&#39;m really quite pleased with the outcome. I just wish it was handled a little better.
