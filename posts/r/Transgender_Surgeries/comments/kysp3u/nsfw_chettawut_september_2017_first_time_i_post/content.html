Hi, I have a couple of questions: how has your recovery been so far? What made you choose Dr. Chettawut over other Doctors? Do you recommend Dr. Chettawut? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to have a labiaplasty or revision surgery (is it the best result I have seen from him)? How is your vaginal depth? How was your stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Chettawut&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried soul dilators? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations on your surgery and the happiness it brought you
</p>

<p>
hey! thanks a lot! :D so, for your questions :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
recovery : it has been quite complicated for the first couple months, had trouble walking and such, then I had an infection just when it was really starting to get better, and that triggered some complications that were only fully dealed with in april 2018, so &#34;recovery&#34; took quite a long time overall. I haven&#39;t had any problems since
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
choice : I basically searched the internet for a while and asked around and settled on Chet mostly because he seemed to have great results sensation-wise and everyone around me who went with him seemed really happy with the results
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
would I recommend him : based on my experience, yes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
revision : haven&#39;t had one, not planning on having one
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
depth : between 5.5 and 6 inches
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
stay in Thailand : I mean it wasn&#39;t really fun, but the nurses aftercare was great. I spent my awake time watching series and movies and sometimes having a chat with the other girls in the hotel
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
aftercare : great for the time of the stay. I will just say : be prepared for eventual complications back home. That was a reason why it took so long for my complications to be treated, I hadn&#39;t take the time to find a doctor I could trust, that was aware of the situation, and that could eventually intervene in case stuff goes wrong. Because although Chet&#39;s aftercare is great during your stay in Thailand, he and his team can&#39;t do the aftercare once you&#39;re back home (unless you live close to Bangkok)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
soul dilators : didn&#39;t try them
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
hope I answered all your questions :)

You results are amazing.
</p>
<p>
One question, why not use Soul dilators? I use them and they seem fine, but I do not have a reference point.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Thanks!

So looks amazing! So pretty if I could have something as good as that, I’d do it in a heartbeat! :) Can I ask? Price, waiting time, what was recovery like and where was immediate recovery? Hotel? Hospital? What sort of depth did the surgery achieve, type of surgery, lubrication and do you have good sensitivity, I mean has it been retained sexually?
</p>
<p>
Many thanks! I know it’s a lot of questions haha!

Thanks a lot! :) to answer your questions :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
price : between 9000 and 10000 € if I remember well, plus maybe 700 for the plane rides (Paris - Bangkok and back), and I don&#39;t remember how much for the hotel
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
waiting time : sent a first email in january 2017, booked in february 2017 for a surgery in september 2017
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
recovery : first two days after the surgery at the clinic, then at the hotel for the rest of my stay in Bangkok. I had a really slow recovery (plus some complications after I came back home but that was not predictable and not Chet&#39;s fault), but once everything was completely healed, it was absolutely great
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the surgery : classic Chet&#39;s non penile inversion with skin graft
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
depth : 6 inches right after surgery, between 5.5 and 6 today
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
lubrication : I get a bit of lubrication, but usually not enough for penetration by anything more than a couple fingers, unless I&#39;m veeeeery turned on or had an orgasm already
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
sensitivity : that&#39;s the best part of all this honestly, I have had no loss of sensation whatsoever, had erotic sensation very early on post op. I actually had a couple times during the first month post op when I was woken up by a spontanuous orgasm (not really a good sensation at 2 weeks post op when stuff is still swollen and healing but eh, my fears of not having sensation completely disapeared after that :P)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hope that was helpful :)

haha thanks again! :D not gonna lie I have bad days like everyone when I only see the &#34;flaws&#34; (like the scars that are still pretty visible, or the shape of the vaginal opening or whatever), but I&#39;m 100% satisfied with it most of the time :D

Well I guess that’s to be expected.  People say I look nice but I see shrek most of the time! 😂
</p>
<p>
I’ve heard that girls are hyper aware of scars but... well I think it’s worth it right to feel whole.  I’m not sure I began this journey thinking I’d get to the stage that I would have that surgery but it’s been on my mind a lot over the last year and I’m quite convinced I want it, one of the doubts I had is regretting it aesthetically.  How long did it take you to decide? Not that I look down with any joy now.
</p>
<p>
Scars take a long time to fade and yours look very subtle to me.  So you are an inspiration.  My ex girlfriend went to Dr Suporn about 12 years ago and she had a good experience but infection and a few things afterwards, so I had considered him too but I think he’s retired or will very soon.

girl you do look nice! :D I really don&#39;t know how much time it took for me to decide to have it done, it just was kind of a long process going on since even before I actually put all this into words I think, so when I realized this was something that I could do, it just seemed obvious to me

alright, so that&#39;s a thing I am actually not very happy about. if I remember well Chet told me that not only I did not need to do it, but also that it could have an impact on tissue elasticity which could have negative effects on the results. I don&#39;t know how much of this is true, but I just decided to trust him on this. Well, turns out I ended up having a bit of hair (like 5 or 6) growing just at the vaginal opening, which is not very cool.. it has not been that huge an issue though, I just pluck them from time to time...

he does surgicaly scrape the hairs, but only for the tissue that&#39;s gonna originally be used for the vaginal lining, and from what I understand tissues can change shape during healing and so some tissue that was originally well outside the vagina (and so was not scraped) can get streched and end up at the opening of the vagina, which is why some girls get a bit of hair for up to the first inch of the vagina..

I guess getting electrolysis is the one thing I would do differently if I could do it all over again

This actually looks like a good Chett result. Why the fuck did that asshole butcher me so badly when I literally asked him for the same thing.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Thank you. I&#39;m sorry to rant on your post and make it about me but I just couldn&#39;t help myself. I&#39;m sad for myself but I&#39;m really happy for your results.
