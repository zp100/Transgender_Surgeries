Realistically I&#39;m satisfied with my results, at first when I got them I thought they are so big and I might sized them wrong! But now after 7 weeks it&#39;s like why I&#39;m thinking I could go bigger than that? üò¨ Idk sometimes they feel big and sometimes they don&#39;t! Got them from dr theerapong Thailand, under the muscle with incision on areola. Overall tbh dr theerapong did a great job, I&#39;ve no scar but the initial recovery was bit hard like for week! I couldn&#39;t able to lift my arms but now it&#39;s all good.

So the incision was the one where they opened the areoles and put the implants in? Looks nice! Not sure how I feel about Thailand for implants but I‚Äôll definitely consider. How long was the wait time after consulting them via email?

The wait time was almost none! I actually had the srs and BA at the same. Yeah he didn&#39;t cut opened the whole areola just the half so he can put the silicone inside. I was afraid before of this incision, I thought I might gonna lose my sensation but nope they are all good.

I kinda want that based on YouTube videos I saw. Under insurance I can probably get surgery covered but I haven‚Äôt heard from any docs yet in my network that does this. One is completely against it actually (below)  and I feel for trans women that incision might be the best. I‚Äôll email them and if they answer my initial questions with ease I‚Äôll consider them.
</p>
<p>
‚Äúi think of the nipple/areolar complex as the most aesthetic part of the breast, it&#39;s a shame to put a scar on the focal point. also, you have to cut thru the gland to get to the plane where you&#39;ll put the implant so it&#39;s more damage to tissues. aaaaand it&#39;s a more contaminated area and contributes more to capsular contracture than any other incision. no one knows specifically what causes cap con, but the risk combined with all of the other things above is why I don&#39;t consider the incision.‚Äù

Same as before totally normal, or even bit more sensitive I think maybe because it&#39;s healing that&#39;s why.

That&#39;s fantastic! I would have figured that an areolar incision would have impacted sensitivity. Happy to hear it doesn&#39;t!

Well don&#39;t forget it&#39;s also depends on person&#39;s recovery! And vary body to body.
