Oh, my heart and prayers are with you.  I know exactly how you feel.  I‚Äôm scheduled for a month from now with her.  I feel exactly the same way.  Something I‚Äôve been wanting and longing for since I was a child, and worked so hard for, and literally never thought would happen, but simultaneously getting more and more terrified with each passing day. Please keep me posted.  I have so many questions and would really love if we could connect to whatever degree you‚Äôre comfortable, by DM.  I have so many things I wonder and have been wondering about, and have asked her team a lot of them, but don‚Äôt want to be a total pest, so I am trying not to ask everything all at once that isn‚Äôt pressing.
</p>
<p>
Are you willing to describe what the pre-op was like? And are you staying in the city afterward, or near by?  Air bnb, or somewhere else?
</p>
<p>
I will be checking in to see if you post more and I will be thinking about you Monday morning. üôå‚ô•Ô∏è

Ask what you want! DM or here is fine, you‚Äôre all going to get a chance to look at my vag on my blog anyways! I‚Äôm very open.
</p>
<p>
Im staying at a recovery house called TransHeartline. Its somewhere north of the golden gate bridge.
</p>
<p>
As for the pre op all they did was poke around my junk then field questions from me. It was really easy and I was scared for nothing!
</p>
<p>
Make sure you check out my blog as well. Im trying to make it super informative.

</ul>
<p>
And this is last thing gonna be really controversial but I&#39;m gonna recommend it anyways. Dr. Wittenberg flat-out just doesn&#39;t give out enough medication for GRS because of the opioid crisis - I was literally maxing out Ibuprofin + Tylenol + Aspirin and burning a hole in my stomach, and it was
<em>
very
</em>
hard for me to dilate, until I ordered 100g of Kratom and started using it for pain.
</p>
<p>
I want to caution,
<em>
kratom is addictive
</em>
- not nearly as much as prescription or street opioids, but it is
<strong>
not
</strong>
something you should take for fun. Take it until you don&#39;t need it, then toss the rest in the trash, but it was the
<em>
only
</em>
thing that cut the pain down to a manageable level. If you&#39;re struggling, it&#39;s something to keep in mind as an option.

Good luck! Dr. Wittenberg is on my short list for bottom surgery!!
</p>
<p>
Would you be willing to make a post(s) after your surgery and throughout recovery? If you are doing vaginoplasty, are you doing PIV or PPT?

I‚Äôm glad it worked out for you! I think it can be worth it but there are +/- it seems. Some self lubrication where PIV won‚Äôt have it. Certain to get full depth. More tissue to work with for rest of the vagina. While this procedure has been practiced for 40+ years in cis women, it hasn‚Äôt been adequately followed up on for any long term side effects or issues.
</p>
<p>
Currently most surgeons who offer PPT only offer it as a revision surgery, for people that may not have enough tissue, or for people who want to keep their penis.
</p>
<p>
I wonder what the reasoning for revisions only is. There is also a hybrid version that can be performed that I don‚Äôt really know much about.

I haven&#39;t experienced any negatives. My healing has been far better. My vagina doesn&#39;t smell like a belly button and has its own pH balance so I don&#39;t have to douche very often. It lubricates itself when aroused like a cis vagina. I don&#39;t have any possibility of hair in the canal. The tissue feels identical to a cis vagina.
</p>
<p>
Wittenberg will do Primary PPT (PPT without it being a revision) now, I was her 8th one.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can&#39;t imagine getting the old version when this is available.

Well let‚Äôs not forget that many people are getting PIV including OP and so we shouldn‚Äôt say this choice is the absolute best. I heard peritoneal tissue can be more fragile too, although that‚Äôs just from someone else who commented on why have the hybrid ppt. It‚Äôs also more costly. Insurance can be fickle...and no given the recent Trump rollback of trans healthcare...even more so.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I think she is maybe the only one that does the classic PPT as first choice and for no special reason other than I want it lol.

I‚Äôd rather not get an experimental surgery like that since I‚Äôm not a paragon of good health. Plus I‚Äôm a Lesbian with an Ace wife so functionality is lower on my list. Its a tried and true operation with years of experience behind it heck, im only getting depth at all so I can something to play with, plus I wouldn‚Äôt want to regret my decision later. More than anything else i just want this penis GONE.

Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about your experience with full PPT? I&#39;m having the hybrid method done with Rachel BBL in a few months, but I&#39;m curious about doing it the way you did because that&#39;s been my dream since I first read about the technique in MRKH cis women like a decade ago.

She is the best!! I just had mine in March with her. Just get off the gabapentin asap and titrate the dose down VERY slowly and start taking chelated magnesium when you do. She doesn&#39;t give much direction about it and I ended up having horrible mental health consequences.

To be honest it also didn&#39;t make a Big Deal of difference for me either, it supposedly prevents shooting pains. Dr. Wittenberg gives it for EVERYTHING though. I&#39;m not sure everyone needs to get off it ASAP, but it&#39;s good to know that this is a thing to watch out for

So this problem isn&#39;t being on it, it&#39;s coming off of it. Gabapentin is used as an antidepressant so when you stop it you can get a dopamine crash to where you literally can&#39;t feel happy and the world seems hopelessly awful. It probably doesn&#39;t happen to everyone but trust me, taking the precautions I said before are well worth not experiencing that.
