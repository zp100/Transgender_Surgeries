Is this dehiscence? Or something normal? 6.5 weeks post-op (Bluebond/Zhao) and was sorta smooth sailing until I went up to orange and did the PT exercises‚Ä¶ üôèüñ§

No problem. Try polysporine. It will go away on its own

Idk about your question but it&#39;s Looking good to me sis.  I got a question that a sister that&#39;s already been there might answer for me.  I still haven&#39;t pried much on where or what is the pain from? Is it the stretching like big around,  is it painful all the way up or just getting it in? And what would it hurt to use some prescription lidocaine like they gave me for laser? I mean if the hole point of dilation is to stretch it and to keep it from closing and losing depth why would we have to bear the pain when it could be numb up a little bit just to make things easier and make it a win win deal rather than a horrible experience,  at least for the first little bit until the worst of the stretching has gotten use to gradually.  I mean a cheap tube of anal ease would even be better that pure pain and it&#39;s a wonderful lubricate I mean look what&#39;s it&#39;s sold intension is for. I know most people in charge ie Dr. Or some party pooper afraid of giving aspirin for a pain would want to stray away from one more drug. But I&#39;m all for it. I use the crap out of my lidocaine for everything that I have at any given moment that is causing me the slightest pain including digging an ingrown townail to a new piercing that yah I&#39;m a pussy and don&#39;t want to feel it and especially because I Don&#39;t have to I just numb it and do my deed and go on happily down the road.
</p>
<p>
As many pain stories aa I&#39;ve heard about the dilation I don&#39;t see what a little upping the advantage would hurt even if there was a small risk of some bs thell think of . Anyone tried this ü§î

Whatever it is, seems like it could be treated
