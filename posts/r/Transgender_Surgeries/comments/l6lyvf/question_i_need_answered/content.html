Hey all Cass here! I have a question for y&#39;all that I hope you have an answer to. I&#39;ve heard horror stories about people having hair inside their vagina after surgery. To any post op trans girls, is this a real thing?

Yes, it definitely happens. You want to do electrolysis on any of the areas the surgeon tells you to. The surgeon typically tries to kill any stray hairs they find during the procedure. It is a good idea to finish your electrolysis a couple months prior to surgery. This will give time for the hairs that are not dead to reappear. Otherwise the surgeon might not be able to find them.

It is possible if you don&#39;t get thorough electrolysis on all tissue that could end up being used to construct the vagina.

Yup. There&#39;s a reason most surgeons recommend hair removal.

VERY true.
</p>
<p>
Let me spell out why by using myself as example.
</p>
<p>
It took years (10 plus I think) for the few hairs that were formerly at the base of my p* to acclimate to inside me and go inactive. Meanwhile I occasionally had very small slowly dissolving hairballs rinsing out. Yeech.
</p>
<p>
I also very slowly have had some attrition of those hairs in my vulva that my surgeon didn&#39;t kill but merely wounded. I have endured years (with 1 in particular inside a fold next to THE worst place) of being annoyed while dilating
<em>
etc
</em>
and yanking them out in frustration only to quickly regret (for a few days) when urine hit those pores. Youch!
</p>
<p>
Back in those years laser was too new and finding someone willing to VERY literally do painstaking electrolysis
<em>
down there
</em>
on T patients had to be intimidating and/or scary for mostly CIS female zappers, and was scary for patients like me (way too intimately wince-inducing an area to think about after feeling a bit too PTSD afflicted after 450-500 hours of blend method electrolysis on my face pre-GRS).
</p>
<p>
I will likely get lasered or zapped inside and slightly above the apex of my vulva before the revision w. Marci Bowers (my in-person consult is in early March).
</p>
<p>
Right now the zapper with speciality experience closest to Louisville, KY that I think may help me is a medspa about 90 miles North in Bloomington, IN. But I really do need to stay local if at all possible to both care for my high 80&#39;s mother, my own medical needs and necessity to conserve funds when possible.
</p>
<p>
Any local recommendations would be welcome, whether they are certain or just a baby maybe.
</p>
<p>
I plan to try calling around locally this time again too. I have my doubts that trying will get me much different results than 20 years ago but I will hold out for a surprise.

Internal hair growth is a real thing and happens when you don’t have any hair removal done prior to surgery. Its really gross because you need to manually scrape the loose hair out from you’re vagina. It’s recommended to remove hair from the shaft, scrotum and perineum.
