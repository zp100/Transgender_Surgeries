I had seen a couple girls I know go with him and they had great results‚Ä¶ and when I first met him me and him got on well so I was assured I‚Äôd have good results from him.. I didn‚Äôt pay too much attention to Reddit reviews on him because everyone‚Äôs experiences are different and everyone‚Äôs vagina is different so o didn‚Äôt expect it to be ‚Äúpicture perfect‚Äù. My main goal was to have the surgery and live a happy life. he is a lovely guy and he does have some great results x

Congratulations girl, I&#39;m 18 month post op with Dr Bellringer and agree with you,  either you love him or hate him.
</p>
<p>
like you I got on very well with him and I&#39;m happy with my new vagina. I had a few issues but looking back they were nothing too serious or concerning. You do hear of some very unhappy girls that he has operated on though. I think it&#39;s down to pot luck to be honest, but saying that he really should take a little more time doing this kind of surgery than rushing through it in 90 mins or so.  Good luck with your ongoing recovery, it gets much easier once you drop to twice per day dilating. Xx

Completely agree with you. He should take more time. I wish he would also take some after surgery to explain to us what he did and what went well and stuff. Instead he said ‚Äúno complications all looks well, see you soon‚Äù üòÇ.. Thankyou for your comment means a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you for sharing. We need more positive Bellringer posts around here. He can be an odd guy but does great work.
</p>
<p>
I was very impressed with how quickly I recovered, how quickly I was able to climax and how quickly I was able to go down to dilating twice a month. Can‚Äôt rate him enough.

I was on NHS.. mine was about a 5 year wait but would‚Äôve been sooner if my gender clinic didn‚Äôt mess up my referal.. I would recommend him yeah. From mine and my friends experiences. He gets a lot of negativity.. but so can other surgeons! I‚Äôll post another update after my 10 week post op checkup then I‚Äôll do it maybe a couple months after thst! Xx

I still got a year before I can schedule with my chosen doctor, and I&#39;m getting an orchi first to make sure I can handle the anesthesia.
