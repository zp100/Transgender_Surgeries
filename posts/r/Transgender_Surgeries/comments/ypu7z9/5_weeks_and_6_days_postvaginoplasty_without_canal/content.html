It looks consistent with the grs Montreal aesthetics. 5 weeks is too soon to say it looks bad. Give at least 6 months to make that judgement.

I&#39;m not saying that I hate the results. I&#39;m saying I&#39;m worried it might be infected or something?. That weird little bubble next to the incision line looks weird and of course the little flap of dangling flesh is scary, though when I sent a picture they said it&#39;s fine and to just keep going? I dunno. Anxiety and pain gets to me easily.

It’s hard to tell, but I had similar-looking bumps that turned out to be stitches coming to the surface.

I expect they&#39;ll clean those up with silver nitrate, and that&#39;s pretty common. You also seem a little swollen yet.

Your surgeon is the one to really judge this. Good to hear you&#39;re seeing them tomorrow! Write down your questions beforehand. I often ask if I can make an audio recording on my phone, because I
<em>
will
</em>
forget things :-) Over here doctors often say yes to that.
<br>
My 2c: I don&#39;t think it looks bad. It&#39;s obviously still healing. Relax, and give it time.
<br>
Please bear in mind there&#39;s a difference between an inflammation and an infection.
<br>
Simplified: an
<strong>
inflammation
</strong>
is irritated tissue, not caused by bacteria and in your case an essential part of your body&#39;s healing process. It can hurt, but (in my experience) it&#39;s a slighty consistent kind of pain. The fluids involved are kind of clear. It can smell really funky, but not nauseatingly awful.
<br>
An
<strong>
infection
</strong>
is caused by bacteria, and things go into overdrive. The pain is often throbbing and can be so intense that it&#39;s deeply unsettling and sickening. You can&#39;t think clearly anymore. The liquid is pus, mostly yellow, and the smell is extremely unpleasant.
</p>
<p>
And yes, you&#39;ve probably had necrotic tissue as well, and that smells quite bad as well. But I don&#39;t see that in your picture, and you should recognise that I guess.

Well that&#39;s kinda concerning. I&#39;d imagine orange-brown would be from blood mixed with the pus stuff. Like, it&#39;s gone down, but when I put my blanket and lay it flat against the area (I have a few of the same and wash them regularly to get rid of the whatever it is and blood. Anyways when I laid the blanket flat, when pull it off it kinda seems to come off with  orangish-brown lines from the incision lines. So thats kinda concerning.

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s concerning, as a matter of fact. I know it&#39;s very stressful, but relax. The blood is also part of the healing process. It contains everything necessary to clean things up.
</p>
<p>
Can you describe the pain? And does it continue even if  nothing touches the area?

Err the pain in general isn&#39;t bad, but it shoots up, now it&#39;s less often, at random times. Can be very bad for a few minutes to an hour, but my default is hardly any pain at all. But my default is also, laying down in bed, on my side, reading from my computer screen, while laying under the sheets. During that time, the pain is almost(not quite but almost) forgotten entirely. It was really similar even when in the hospital/recovery home that first week. And now I can walk alot, though I don&#39;t since I don&#39;t like to.

Seriously, this does not sound infected to me at all. An infection almost has a life of its own, and the pain often goes on even when you are in the most comfy position there is.
<br>
My personal experience:
</p>
<p>
Five, six weeks in I had waves of pain for an hour or so each day. What worried me most was a patch of necrotic tissue on my clitoris.  I had several doctor visits in those six weeks, and they said everything was okay. And they were happy I came to them with my worries.
<br>
The last patch of necrosis went away at six weeks, sort of overnight.
</p>
<p>
So please relax, take an ibuprofen/advil, and talk to your doctor tomorrow. Don&#39;t hold back on your worries! Alleviating fears is part of aftercare as well, and a pretty important one. A happy and relaxed patient heals faster :-)
</p>
<p>
Good luck, and give us an update.

I&#39;ve honestly sent more emails to the post op nurse team at asclepiade then I have sent emails in total over the last 5 years. So don&#39;t worry, I keep in touch. I do these posts to see what people that aren&#39;t directly connected to the same place as where I had my surgery say. Like, I know that it&#39;s probably fine (in fact during my stay at the recovery home my healing was faster then anticipated and the removed the catheter 1 or 2 days before was expected. It&#39;s just, the anxiety gets to me. And like, I know that most people who post post op pics here are those that like the look of it(most not all), but like, even knowing that, it&#39;s hard to see their smooth lines and skin, and to see mine, which is like, bulbous, and not that pretty close up.  And I know that&#39;s not reasonable of me, cause it&#39;s like comparing real food to drawn/animated food. It&#39;s the same subject, but different medium, can be faked, filtered etc. Just... I love having it, yet I keep seeing these things I never heard of that go on with it and I just panic.
</p>
<p>
Anyways point is. Yeah I know, inside, that I&#39;m being unreasonable, but the anxiety kicks me in th... oh my god! Hah! I don&#39;t have nuts anymore! Umm. Anyways thank you. Its always comforting to hear the, &#34;calm down, you&#39;re fine.&#34; Responses.
</p>
<p>
Tldr; thanks for telling me what I have heard so often but still need to hear cause anxiety is a bitch. I really appreciate it!

Believe me, I totally get it. I was very nervous about things that resolved themselves. And those worries are natural. It’s very good and healthy to bounce it off other people instead of walking around with it on your own ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I looks like where a stich might be, as you heal you&#39;ll probably find that the skin will relax and not be as tight or sore to the touch but it can take a while.
</p>
<p>
Honestly though mate, it looks pretty healthy for the 6 week mark and a pretty good result. It will only improve as it heals.

I&#39;m at 7 weeks post op zero depth, I look very similar. Main difference I can see is my labia are longer which made me concerned about feces in the drains. But it wasn&#39;t an issue. Just keep healing!

For me, I&#39;m not that good with anal. But in terms of sexual fantasies, mine. Can be done with the inch of space I do have inside. (Bullet/wearable vibe with remote control is like, the one thing I want to try the most, being in both positions.)

Hmmm it went... alright. The skin flap was hypergranulation, which he used... I dunno some kinda chemical to help it dissolve and God I hadn&#39;t been in that much pain since 2 weeks after surgery. Otherwise I was doing really good!?
</p>
<p>
Except now, just earlier, I notices I have very very raw skin along the inside of the... bumcrack/tailbone. And I don&#39;t know what to do about that. I doubt it&#39;s a recovery thing, just a general body being a bitch thing. Now that hurts, it&#39;s super red and owwwww. Plus, I don&#39;t know if my family doctor would answer to email+photo the same way the post op nurses do so I don&#39;t know what to do to get help. Kinda scary 😨

Good! I&#39;m really happy to hear that! Sorry to hear about the pain but I hope your fears have been put to rest. I don&#39;t have experience with hypergranulation.
</p>
<p>
Have you been in bed, on your back a lot because of recovery, and might that be the cause of the rawness?

It looks better yeah. I do have minor revisions upcoming, just fixing a tiny spot where the stitches dissolved too fast or were too loose but it&#39;s not anything bad or painful, just odd and not supposed to be there. As for the rest well the basic shape it still the same, but it&#39;s good. The clit is different then I expected but it&#39;s functional. I was finally able to climax a few weeks ago now with no extra pain or anything. And there hasn&#39;t been any internal hair follicles or anything. So yeah. It&#39;s great. Good luck

There’s so few posts on this surgeon that if if it’s good it doesn’t mean much. Still risky.
