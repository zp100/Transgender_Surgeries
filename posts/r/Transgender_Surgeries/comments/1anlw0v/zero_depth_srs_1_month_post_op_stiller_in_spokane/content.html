Your results are just elegant and beautiful, I wasn’t sure if stiller had any good aesthetics until I seen yours. It’s also relieving seeing black girls on the sub from time to time. Feels like I’m not the only one here that looks for results that I can relate to.

Thank you, I love my results even at just 1 month in so I know I’ll love them even more as time goes on. I feel you though it’s refreshing to see people similar to you even if we are all the same at the end of the day.

Your result looks very good, when you are completely recovered it will look excellent, I have a question:Do you plan to have the colon technique or is it just the minimum depth?

It looks great. I’ve been looking into the colovaginoplasty. I read into it, and this surgery is completed after the zero depth. Is what you are doing?

Correct I got zero depth first and I’ll be having the 2nd part done in 11 months.
</p>
<p>
Originally my surgery dates were for January 14th 2025 and July 15 2025 but I got a cancellation for January 2024. Which is why I have to wait the year instead of 6 months for 2nd stage :)

Gotcha. I was reading about it on his website. I really like that after the 2nd surgery you have get vaginal depth, and no skin grafts

Another question while you waiting for this the heal before the 2nd surgery. Can you at least have some fun without the penetration?

I was discharged right after surgery. I had to stay in Spokane for 2 weeks in a hotel or airbnb.
</p>
<p>
Surgery was the 9th I had to be there from the 8th until 25th

Yeah everything went smoothly everyone is so nice. I text them ALOT with questions before and after surgery and they are so responsive. The only drawback are his long wait times for consult and surgery 😭.

girl ya my suture popped and i think thats why the 2nd pic looks the way it looks on my labia fold and ive been bleeding because of that luckily NO pain but its still annoying. GIRL the SMELL. I wash her with soap qtips everything the whole 9 yards it does not go away. I asked dr Stiller at my 2 week and he said itll be like that for awhile :|. it def has calmed down a lot tho everytime i opened my legs for like the first 3 weeks it was HORRIBLE. But now its def better lol.
</p>
<p>
Thank you! I&#39;ll continue to post more results at my 3 month with a better review lol

girl yes the smell was horrible, i remember i popped my suture in October, and my mom and I had to drive over to Spokane because I was freaking out, luckily nothing was wrong, but I remember when I put my legs up in the air and the smell I was so embarrassed and mortified lol I wanted to cry and i asked the nurse about it and she said that it’s completely normal, and would be weird if i didn’t have a smell 😭 now it smells perfectly fine thank god, it gets better!

Thank you! I&#39;m really surprised I wasnt bruised and super swollen.
<br>
I do love my results and would def recommend him and his team they are all amazing to work with. I annoy them with so many texts and they dont care at all.
</p>
<p>
Theres another girl who just had surgery with him about a week or 2 ago on here as well her results look just as good. so it seems hes consistent!
</p>
<p>
He also asked me to bring pics of how i wanted my vagina to look so he could replicate it lol. he puts them on the board in the surgery room

I have Anthem BCBS. I&#39;ll certainly have to look into whether Stiller accepts them as well

So what are the advantages of doing it this way vs other methods? I know it’s generally said lubrication is better. Are all colon vaginoplasty done in 2 steps?
</p>
<p>
I do like the astetics, I wonder if doing min depth in general gives better looking vaginas and then do colon for full depth gives the best of both worlds, aka great astetics and being able to be penetrated?

I had my GAS (gender affirming surgery) a few years ago and had it collapse and have been left with 0 depth since. It has bothered me for years, but haven&#39;t been in a place to be able to get a correction done. I&#39;d be very curious to hear how your 2nd step goes and maybe it&#39;ll be an option for me.

For sure, but thank you long in advance. xD. idk if I&#39;m for the colon or stomach version, but I&#39;m probs another few years off getting a correction (fat and need to lose weight before a surgeon will operate...other issues with that). No pressure on your friend, but hearing her story would be cool too.
