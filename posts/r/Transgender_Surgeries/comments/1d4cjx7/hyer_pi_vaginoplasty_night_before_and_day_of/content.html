This is part of my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bottomsurgery2024/comments/1d4clyz/index_of_posts/">series of posts
</a>
documenting my penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. Hyer. I will try to answer comments and DMs, but this is a throwaway and I do not check it often.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
tl;dr
</strong>
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of &#34;hurry up and wait&#34; involved with medicine. After surgery, I felt nothing (both no pain and no penis), and was evidently in better physical condition than most patients.
</p>
<p>
I would
<strong>
<em>
strongly recommend
</em>
</strong>
everyone pack cough drops in addition to whatever else their surgery team recommends, because the intubation sore throat is real.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
General Context
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My partner and I had booked an Airbnb not far from Denver Health with the intent of staying there for the first week. Surgeries with Dr. Hyer are done on Tuesdays, and my one week follow-up appointment was scheduled for the following Monday; we booked the Airbnb for Monday-Monday.
</p>
<p>
We had received a phone call from Denver Health on the Friday previously telling us to be at the hospital at 5:30am on Tuesday. I do wish that they had given us this time sooner (at least a week or two in advance).
</p>
<p>
Note on the times - I have a habit of marking out things with detail to time; these times are as accurate as I can recall and are based on notes I wrote into my phone during initial recovery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Night Before
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I ate my last meal at 18:45, then took a shower around 21:00 with the cleansing foam provided by Denver Health during my January visit. I realized after the shower that the foam has a label stating that it is not supposed to be used on the genitals - I was not aware of this at the time as the nurses at the visit had simply stated to do it on everything &#34;neck down.&#34; This would probably be worth clarifying for those doing surgery in the future.
</p>
<p>
Last drink of water was at 22:15, followed by bed. I woke up at 03:00 (in part due to nerves/excitement and in part due to an unfamiliar bed) and at 04:45 took my morning shower with the cleansing foam, as instructed by Denver Health.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Morning of Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We left the Airbnb around 05:00 and cleared security at Denver Health by 05:15.
</p>
<p>
We got to the surgery waiting room around 05:20, but didn&#39;t actually do much until around 07:30. During this long wait, I was given Tylenol and Celebrex, as well as told to wipe down my entire body with cleaning wipes (for those counting, that&#39;s the third time in about 9 hours that I did some variant of &#34;disinfect my body&#34;).
</p>
<p>
I was given a leg compression garment (which was by far one of the most comfortable leg massages I&#39;ve ever had) to assist with maintaining circulation, and then some midazolam via a hand IV. The midazolam seems to be standard protocol, though the anesthesiologist also noted that it would help calm me down, as I was a bit nervous about getting a needle in the back for the spinal block.
</p>
<p>
I was then wheeled to the OR (probably around 07:45 or 08:00), where they sat me up to give me the spinal block - which very quickly numbed out my feet. The doctors and nurses present indicated that was an expected. The last thing I remember was them putting an O2 mask on me. I know stereotypically people are told to count down, but I don&#39;t even remember doing that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Immediately Post Op
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My partner received a phone call at 11:30 stating that I was awake but in and out of sleep. I don&#39;t recall waking up until 12:30, but I do recall having vivid and bizarre dreams, which were likely related to &#34;waking up.&#34; I was extremely groggy and mostly wanted to sleep. Personal belongings were handed to me at 12:40 and I was writing down my initial notes at 12:52. I noticed a pressure in my genitals, which I assumed was from the pressure dressing they had applied (see first picture on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1d3q5k6/vaginoplasty_dr_hyer_denver_health_first_3_days/">this photo post
</a>
). Despite having last eaten at 18:45 the night before, I also wasn&#39;t hungry.
</p>
<p>
My throat was extremely sore as a result of the intubation. I would strongly recommend anyone getting surgery to pack cough drops (these are not listed on standard lists of &#34;things to bring for surgery,&#34; as far as I can tell).
</p>
<p>
The nurses wheeled me to my room at 13:15. To my amusement, they asked me about pain - to which I accurately responded that I had no pain. I was subsequently poked with some kind of thimble or needle to assess numbness - my left side was numb but I could feel everything. The leg massager was reattached at 13:35. At 14:00, I was given an IV antibiotic push along with oral pain meds - Tylenol and Celebrex. I requested a cough drop and was given some nasty tasting cherry menthol garbage at 14:25.
</p>
<p>
By 14:35 my grogginess was starting to clear up and I was able to process what had happened. I reportedly had a vagina and a catheter in, but I honestly couldn&#39;t feel anything (as I later learned, this was due to the spinal block still being in effect).
</p>
<p>
At 14:58, Dr. Hyer and Carly (who I believe is something amounting to head nurse for Denver Health&#39;s trans women health program) came in to check on me. No issues were noted, and they swapped out the chux pad underneath me so it wouldn&#39;t get too saturated with blood. I did surprise them at this time by doing a bridge/plank motion that allowed me to fully elevate my butt above the chux; apparently this is not something most patients can do so soon after surgery. I was sternly told to lie in bed and not try walking.
</p>
<p>
At this time, it mostly felt like I had on slightly-too-tight panties with the barest hint of a tuck. I overwhelmingly felt nothing, which was a pretty awesome (and imo highly underrated) feeling. The dressing looks like flat panties (!!) with a lot of tape. Dr. Hyer noted that I had about 15 feet of gauze stuffed into my vagina (though I think that might have been a slight exaggeration).
</p>
<p>
At 15:40, the nurse came in and changed out my sheets - apparently I had ended up on top of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson-Pratt_drain">JP drain
</a>
and gotten blood everywhere. My partner also arrived at this time to check up on me.
</p>
<p>
At 16:20, Dr. Hyer and Carly came in again and changed my dressing. They added hemostatic gauze to the urethra, which tends to bleed the most. Dr. Hyer noted that the dressing tends to get soaked in blood when patients turn on their side (as I had done for a nap).
</p>
<p>
At 17:00 I ordered food from the hospital food service. It arrived at 17:45 and was about as disappointing as you&#39;d expect Sodexo to be - the chicken noodle soup is reheated Campbell&#39;s; the pot roast was oversalted and dry and literally just meat on a dish without any accompanying carbs; the chili con carne was extremely meh; the gelatin was extremely watery; and the ginger ale itself was also watered down to begin with. However, it was food and filled up my belly somewhat.
</p>
<p>
My partner left for the Airbnb again at 18:25 as I settled in for another nap, though I woke up at 18:50 thinking that there was liquid sloshing around in the dressing (there wasn&#39;t, best I could tell). I had fart at this time and it felt amazing.
</p>
<p>
I fell asleep again shortly after but was woken up at 20:00 for a vitals check. BP was a bit low at 97/52 (as I later learned, this is pretty common among people who are lying flat for extended periods of time). The nurses check vitals every 4 hours, virtually guaranteeing no sleep. The spinal block was starting to wear off at this time, as I could start feeling the catheter in me and things were starting to become sore.
</p>
<p>
At 21:45, I asked the nurse for some Tylenol in case the catheter pain flared overnight. It occurred to me at this time that I was definitely not cis, because my overwhelming concerns were about &#34;I hate catheters&#34; and not &#34;I don&#39;t have a penis.&#34;

This seems very similar to my experience with surgery with Dr Hyer. Dr Hyer and Carly are both very kind people. How has recovery been? Howâ€™s dilation working out for you?

Recovery has been pretty smooth for me overall. Dilation has become a little more painful over the last few weeks as scar tissue solidifes around the vaginal entrance; I plan on asking about that at my next post op visit.
