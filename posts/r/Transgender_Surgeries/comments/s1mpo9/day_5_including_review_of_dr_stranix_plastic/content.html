TLDR at the bottom including link to pic of results (idk how to combine pic and test post in 1)
</p>
<p>
Just got home from GRS done at UVA in Virginia. This is a new offering by them I was actually the first full depth surgery they have done before me they had done 3  zero depth vaginoplasties. there were a couple extra steps I had to make sure was complete as they do not yet have any options for hair removal so that had to be completely done. As it was a new program it was a little disorganized so if you have anything in the near future with them make sure to educate yourself and ask lots of question. Despite all that if you put in the work these 2 surgeons are amazing. I was checked on daily while in the hospital for recovery. They required 5 days in hospital following to procedure. They required all the usual letters and stuff to get it set up. The wait time was under 6 months. I did have to do my own follow up to get the date set as they were moving offices to a more permanent location in UVA plastic surgery.Ok on the the surgeons. Dr, Stranix he was amazing he was also trained by Blubond he uses the same technique she uses in her surgeries. Like I say it was a new program so there were some information holes but I knew everything by the pre surgery appointment that took place 2 weeks before going in. Anything that was not readily available was made available same day he went out of his way to find the info and get it to you. He showed deep care for trans folks and said part of the reason why he decided to settle in VA was due to the lack of GRS surgeons in the area.  During each visit after surgery while in the hospital he took all the time I needed to answer all questions and explain how and why things are the way they are if I asked so I fully understood the choice he made in his recovery plan. Believe day 4 was a 45 minute conversation and day 5 discharge day he was in there for well over an hour talking things over with me. I cannot say enough good things about this man and I am REALLY glad I gave his practice a chance and went with him. Even after discharge when I got home and realized a script was wrong I sent a message and it was fixed and at the pharmacy in under 45 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Corbett (UVA urology) This is the surgeon who did my orchi about 2 years back. whe I had my orchi done he had mentioned UVA was looking to start a program for full bottom surgery. He is who I went thru to get a appointment with Stranix. He is also the one who does the internal part of GRS with a robot. I did not meet with him as much because nearly all of the surgery calls were made by Stranix. He did however come in and speak to me 2 times and sent his tam each day to make sure I was able to use the bathroom and check on the incisions in my abdomen that were used to insert the robot &#34;arms&#34; He uses parts of the peritoneum to form to vaginal canal as well and existing tissue from the curren load out of parts you were born with. While I did not deal with him as much for this procedure he is an amazing doctor and has done everything in his power to help me get both of these done including a few calls to insurance due to requiring an orchi before the 12 months of hormones mark. So I know from previous times how great of a doctor he is and still is.
</p>
<p>
The only downside to this would be the stay in the hospital. You stay in the general OR recovery ward. While there were some amazing nurses I met. There were a few that left a bit to be desired. I didn&#39;t say much I understand over worked short staff new covid surge and all but it seems a few of the nurses needed to not be involved in patient care. When I voiced this to Dr. Stranix he went to the nursing director and gave em hell so to speak. He said he will not stand for his patients getting anything but the best care and nurses not doing much to help out cuz of lack of knowledge is not an excuse and he won&#39;t have that with any of his patients. The next day it seemed a few of the folks I mentioned were removed from having to care for me. So if you have anything done here and feel in any ways slighted but anyone who is caring for you reach out to Dr. Stranix he will fix the issue. mine went on a bit long as I was trying to be understanding and not cause a fuss and I was not wanting to add stress to already at their limit in stress nurses. But in the future if I have anything done I will be communicating anything that seems off same day to the Dr.
</p>
<p>
TLDR (Number Ratings)
</p>
<p>
Dr. Stranix 20/10 serious cannot say enough good things about his as well as Dr. Corbett Dr. Corbett 20/10 Same as above they make an amazing team After surgery hospital stay 6/10 could use a bit of improvement Wait time from first call to surgery 7 months Accepts most insurances and is in a university hospital so they have bill assistance for in state folks. Give em a chance they won&#39;t disappoint imo.
</p>
<p>
Also AMA if you have any more questions. I plan to keep this post updated every 2 weeks with a new pic and any other thoughts.

Thanks for the post, this is the first time I&#39;ve heard of these surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Are these your surgeons?

Yup these are the surgeons. I hadn&#39;t heard of Stranix til July of Last year. And as I said they only recently started offering GRS as he completed training for it last year has only did a total of 4 of them as of me 3 were zero depth and mine was his first full depth. I was mainly doing a review and all due to no one hearing about him and Dr. Corbett and they did an amazing job and are super friendly and understanding surgeons and wanted to get them out there more specially for the Virginia area as the options here for surgeons that accept insurance is really small. the accepting insurance combined with the short wait list might really help out some folks who are either on a long wait list or haven&#39;t been able to find a good one who accepts their insurance. As you see the results atleast to me and others who have seen are amazing considering it was his first full depth.
</p>
<p>
Really happy I took a chance on a surgeon who was new and didn&#39;t really have a name built up for himself, everyones gotta start somewhere. In addition to MtF bottom surgery I believe he does top surgery for FtM folks and for MtF folks as well as a few other options. The more surgeons folks have to speak with and all the better imo. It&#39;s really hard to find a sub 1 year wait list surgeon and currently his wait list is 3-6 months depending on insurance. If you self pay I believe it&#39;s under a month.

This post makes me feel so good about my decision to go through Stranix and Corbett.
</p>
<p>
Ive met with Stranix twice now, as he’s doing my breast augmentation (16 days from this comment), as well as my bottom surgery in the next year or so. He’s been nothing but kind and caring and hasn’t hesitated to answer any questions I’ve had.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t found many reviews from him, but from yours alone I feel so confident in my choice! Hopefully you continue to post photo updates and such as I’m definitely interested to see how everything goes!
</p>
<p>
Hope you have a steady recovery!

Yeah in the last 2 or 3 years I have spoken with a huge number of surgeons for bottom surgery. Between wait lists and all I went with him, he has been great the entire time. I am sure he will do great on your upcoming surgery as well as bottom surgery in the future if that is who you pick. The way he went over everything and explained things even if he hadn&#39;t yet done a full depth one made me feel really good about his ability to do it and not botch it all up.
</p>
<p>
Been almost 2 weeks now and the only complication I have had thus far is a bit of separation, but I was warned that might happen in that area on discharge and it&#39;s not that bad and seems to be getting healthy tissue growth back around it. Seems separation is a common thing to happen. I suppose by the way he does it I actually have most of my sensitivity of parts as they should be.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your top surgery you can feel free to DM me if ya have any other things to ask about em or whatever =)

I had a consultation with Dr. Stranix on 2/15 and he was just as &#34;Tossitawayreview&#34; said.  Very nice, very friendly, answered all my questions.
</p>
<p>
Now, I am having Gender Nullification Surgery, but that is not an issue for them.  They didn&#39;t even bat an eye.  Dr. Stranix talked to me like I was a person, not a file.  It was refreshing.
</p>
<p>
Insurance has to do their thing, but I have a tentative surgery date of June 2 (tentative cause of any potential delay due to insurance).
</p>
<p>
But they were so amazingly nice.  I was nervous and it showed.  When they took my vitals, my BP was high, my pulse was over 100.  The nurse was like &#34;we&#39;re gonna take that again&#34;, I was like &#34;I&#39;m just nervous&#34; to which she said &#34;oh honey, you don&#39;t got a thing to worry about&#34;.  She was right.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s just the kind of people that work in that office. :)  If you go with Dr. Stranix, you have made a good choice.

What a huge confidence boost seeing your post. I&#39;m scheduled with them for August 16th for ppt, and I&#39;ve been really nervous about it just because of how little feedback is out there yet. Glad to hear your recovery is going well. How has healing and dilation been going? We need updates!

Hi there!
</p>
<p>
I had Stranix for top surgery, and decided, based on my experiences there, to go with him for bottom surgery. I just wanted to see how things were with you four or so months on!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I have my date scheduled for early July, and I&#39;m both excited and nervous!

Ridiculously good.  Apart from sitting, I don&#39;t need opioids.  For sitting, it&#39;s opioids.  I was freaked out when I kept on saying my pain was a 0~2, and the found out I was only on Tylenol/ibuprofen.   The wound vac/dressing is a major annoyance, and I think I keep it until Monday.  Really no complaints at all.

Except the eggs.  The eggs are sad.
