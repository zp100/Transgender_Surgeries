<p>
Yesterday I had my first consult with Dr Jonathan Witten in Louisville KY for GRS. I wanted to make a quick write up for anyone who might be interested in him. I’ve seen a few people have used him before but there isn’t a lot on him on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
I arrived a little early and checked in and got the standard paperwork to fill out but also had another form that asked for preferred name and pronouns.
</p>
<p>
I was called back about 15 minutes later.  The nurse took me to a semiprivate cubicle and asked me a few quick questions. Height, weight, meds and insurance info. Standard stuff.
</p>
<p>
Then the wait started. I ended up having to wait for almost an hour before I was finally taken back to a room to wait for the doctor. They were EXTREMELY busy. It looked to me like they had overbooked.
</p>
<p>
I was taken back to a room. Where my wife and I waited. It was about 10 minutes and he stuck his head in really quick and told me that he was sorry he was running behind. He had one more patient to talk to and then he would be in with me.
</p>
<p>
When he came in he brought a Scribe with him. He was very friendly. I liked him a lot. He started by asking a few standard WPATH questions. How long I had been confident in my identity, how long in hormones, support. Then he asked a lot of other questions about bodily functions, able to pee ok, pooping normal. Lol. I didn’t expect them.
</p>
<p>
He asked what I hoped to accomplish with GRS. I told him I wanted what was between my legs gone. He asked if I wanted Vaginoplasty or vulvaplasty or if I wanted an orchi first or what I wanted. He then explained very well what goes into making a neo vagina or just the vulva. I was honest and told him that an orchi wasn’t an option so no point in discussing it.
</p>
<p>
I had done a lot of research on Vaginoplasty and knew that’s what I was wanting. He explained both though and what to expect. What I really liked is that he explained some of the problems that can happen. I like to know everything, good and bad. Everything he told me matched with everything I had read already. He did tell me that his dialation schedule is 30 min 3 times a day for a year. That’s a lot more than most doctors say but he explained his reasoning and I tend to agree with him on it. He also told me that he doesn’t do follicle scraping because it causes undo trauma to the area. It could take longer to heal because of that. I understood and it does make sense.
</p>
<p>
He also talked about smoking and weight. I’m a big girl. My BMI is 35.4. He said a lot of surgeons won’t do it on a BMI over 35 and while he isn’t a stickler for that the less weight the better I was going to do. I already knew I wanted to lose worthy now I have the motivation to do it. When it comes to smoking there is a zero tolerance policy. In fact before surgery I’ll be blood tested and if there is any nicotine in my system they will cancel the surgery. He’s very serious about it.
</p>
<p>
I had a few questions for him about taking time of work because I have a very physical job. I told him I planned on taking 3 months off and he said that should be good.
</p>
<p>
I had some questions about cost and scheduling. He told me that his scheduler handles all that and he not too sure about it.
</p>
<p>
He then told me that he needed to do an exam to see what he had to work with. He stepped out so I could get undressed and when he came back in he brought a nurse along. She stayed on the other side of the curtain while he looked.  It didn’t take 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
He stepped out and I got dressed. When he came back he told me that I was lucky. His scheduler was actually there so I could talk to her.
</p>
<p>
She explained my insurance concerns and also how scheduling worked. Once I am cleared of hair I will be put on the schedule. If people cancel I will get a call and see if I want to move up my surgery date. I should be done with hair removal by October which is just in time to change insurance so it will be covered. She said it’s quite probable that I will be having surgery by December/January.
</p>
<p>
I was given a booklet about Vaginoplasty and how it worked at his clinic. What to expect. All that fun stuff.
</p>
<p>
I had to schedule for 6 months for a check up where he will see how much hair is left to be removed and I’ll probably be put on the schedule for surgery.
</p>
<p>
My wife and I both like him a lot. He seemed very knowledgeable and had a very friendly demeanor. I feel comfortable and confident with him as my choice for a surgeon.

If your comfortable with him and have confidence in him, he should be Ok as your surgeon. That is what i looked for when i had my surgery. Did he answer all your questions?

Yes. He answered most of the questions I had before I had a chance to ask them. Lol. My biggest one was cost. My insurance won’t cover it. His scheduler told me that the best thing is to switch insurance before surgery to one that will pay for it. That was really my biggest fear.

The insurance bullshit does suck, but shop around to see if you can find a policy that will cover your surgery. I was lucky mine covered it.

Yeah I’m going to work with his scheduler and find an insurance that will work the best for me. Basically I want a low copay for my normal doctors and the least out of pocket expenses for surgery. I only need it for a yea then I’ll switch back to my current insurance. It’s good insurance except for not covering surgery. Lol

Most surgeons scheduler and billing will work with patients. If you get a new insurance carrier, also ask if there is a waiting period too. With my surgeon, his people did a great job with me and that is what you want.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to look into scheduling your surgery in Jan so all your out of pocket expenses are paid for the year. You will need it to cover your post-op visits and if complications need attention too.

Scheduling in January is a good idea. It probably won’t be until December/January anyway but yeah getting the out of pocket expenses done for the year up front is a good idea. Thanks. I didn’t think about that.

Sometimes we don&#39;t think about that stuff. When i scheduled my surgery, i made sure i had all my bases covered. It is a good idea to make out a check list before hand.
</p>
<p>
I scheduled my surgery in Jan too for those reasons. Plus winter time is better for the healing process and my vagina was fairly healed when the weather got nicer so i could do things around the house.

Yeah I’m doing mine in the winter because of work. My work schedule slows down in the winter and my clients are spaced out more so I won’t be out for too long in that case. If it was spring that’s my busy time and I just can’t.

I&#39;m from Evansville so Dr Witten was high on my list simply because of geography.  Do you have to stay in Louisville for a week before releasing you to go home? Did you have a chance to see the facilities?

The surgery is done there somewhere. I didn’t get to see the actual room. He told me that I will spend 5 days in bed. No exceptions. Lol. So yeah I’ll be there from Saturday (the day he does surgeries) until Thursday. On that Thursday he will remove the dressing and catheter and packing and show me how the dressings are done. Then I’ll be able to go home for a week. I have to come back the following week to get dilators and learn how to dilate. I live in Lexington so it’s about an hour away for me.

Thank you for sharing your consultation experience with Dr. Witten!
</p>
<p>
I have a consultation with him next week and was digging around to see if anyone here had experience with him.
</p>
<p>
Sounds very promising and I&#39;m so excited you!
