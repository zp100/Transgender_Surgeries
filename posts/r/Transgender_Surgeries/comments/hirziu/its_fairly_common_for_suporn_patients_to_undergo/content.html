It&#39;s fairly common for Suporn patients to undergo revisions to touch up things. Why then is it so rare for Chettawut patients to go for revisions?

I&#39;ve read so many accounts of Suporn revisions. Yet there are almost no accounts of Chettawut revisions. Both of them don&#39;t charge for revisions and both of them are geographically in the same area.
</p>
<p>
Why is there such a large disparity between the two? I know that so many Chett patients wish they could go back for a revision to make the fourchette yet I can&#39;t find any accounts of anyone actually doing so.

When I had srs with chettawutt, I asked for what he called a clitoral setback, since I wanted the clitoris to be repositioned in a less forward position. He told me that this wouldn&#39;t be a free revision because he didn&#39;t consider it necessary. I ended up pursuing other closer surgeons since chett was going to charge.
</p>
<p>
So this is anecdotal, but I think maybe chett doesn&#39;t actually do free revisions unless he considers them necessary, so maybe that&#39;s why there are less. I was pretty annoyed that he wouldn&#39;t do it actually because my understanding that he does do free revisions was a major factor in choosing chett.

I don&#39;t know a tremendous amount about Chett&#39;s technique. But I do know Suporn (and Bank) go out of their way to preserve as much of the source tissue as possible, so none of it goes to waste and there&#39;ll be tissue available for a future revision. Then most revisions they do are to reduce this excess tissue, along with the usual cosmetic &#34;tidying up&#34; that lots of post-op girls would like to get anyway. Plus their first revision is free.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it&#39;s wise to consider surgery at Suporn Clinic to be two-stage from the beginning. First the primary surgery, and then a second cosmetic revision about a year later, all included in the initial price.

Oh, I just noticed you said Chett&#39;s first revision is free as well. I assume it&#39;s because of differences in technique. Chett is more likely to give an good result with the first surgery, whereas Suporn gives an ok result with the first surgery and an excellent result with the revision.

I think its a combination of several things.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you&#39;re the perfectionist type who going to want a revision you&#39;re more likely to pick Suporn due to his reputation for revisions, which then reinforces that reputation.
</li>
<li>
Suporn&#39;s quite a bit more expensive so people who go to him tend to have more money and are more likely to be able to afford to go back.
</li>
<li>
I&#39;ve heard a number of times that Chettawut has refused to do revisions, even for money. Suporn does do even tiny revisions, and until he announced his retirement there was no limit to how many times or when. There&#39;s a limit now, one free in 12-18 months I think, but you can still pay after that.
</li>
<li>
The difference in techniques may influence it but I don&#39;t know enough about it to be sure.
</li>
</ul>
