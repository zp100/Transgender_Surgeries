A major reason surgeons don’t make the labia completely enclose the vaginal opening is that the ends of the flaps that make the labia are around the vaginal opening. When the flaps get too long, the ends of them are prone to tissue death due to lack of blood supply. You see a lot of temporary tissue death and skin falling of by the vaginal opening already with current length. My surgeon gets them pretty close to enclosing but basically all of us get some fibrous exudate and skin sloughing there which leads to a bit more scarring. Not to mention all the rubbing and stretching from dilation in that area.

My surgeon is one of the few ones bringing the labia all the way around the opening and i had no sign of necrosis  everything was done in one surgery. I personally think thats an excuse due to lack of skill of the surgeon.

This! Also labia minora rarely take roots from the clitoral frenulum. Instead, there’s often no hood, no frenulum, and a clit — often too big — weirdly put between labia minora. And labia minora often are almost inexistant, or fusing with labia majora.

All of these things seem like common issues as well, though the surgeons I have been looking at seem to do well with most of those - RBL and Min Jun.

If you look at the way PI and PPT are done you can see why the lines from the mons are created, it would take a 2nd stage surgery to correct that, which often happens later. The rest involves the patients anatomy and the making of the vaginal canal to get around the pelvic bone and be anchored. This is why the dilators we use have a bend in them. It forces the vulva lower. There&#39;s no doubt that all of these aesthetic elements can vary a lot based on the patient and the tissue available. It&#39;s a much wiser approach to see a MtF vaginoplasty on it&#39;s own merits instead of seeing them as failing to meet the ideal standards of a natal vagina. It&#39;s getting closer all the time, but it&#39;s not there consistently yet.

I&#39;m not sure I can wrap my brain around going through all of the bureaucratic bullshit that leads up to surgery, then the pain and emotional struggle that follows it to not be happy with my results. Frankly, with a displaced vaginal opening and the lines on the mons, I would not be happy. Seems to me that it might not be a viable option *for me* if this is the answer :(

What I am saying is that you already noted some common differences that you see and don&#39;t appeal to you. There are genuine reasons why that it based on the current techniques and surgeons. This involves a compromise between form and function. You may sacrifice considerable function or sensitivity by pushing to perfectly emulate a natal vagina. I&#39;m sure there are all kinds of people that will tell you what you want is doable and a particular surgeon worked for them. Whether is was the results they had always planned for, who knows? I can tell you that mine sure wasn&#39;t. It took 4 more years and 3 more revision surgeries to get it to an acceptable outcome, but even now, more than 5 years later, I have issues I never anticipated.

You alluded to this in your last comment, but told me to do my research when I asked you to expound. So I&#39;ll ask again: what are those reasons? I cannot find any documentation that tells me about these limitations, though that may be in part because if the way I&#39;m describing it. I&#39;ve been to two vaginoplasty informationals. Neither of the surgeons knew what I was referring to re: lines, and one mentioned that he cannot make a labia minora, so of course the vaginal canal wouldn&#39;t be placed inside of it. My consults are scheduled with other surgeons, but are still years away. I was hoping I could get someone who already has this knowledge to share with me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had so many struggles with yours. I would be a hot mess and I&#39;d love to avoid that. It&#39;s why I&#39;m here asking for information after two years of not being able to find what I&#39;m looking for.

I would love everyone to avoid my GRS experience as well.

The lines you&#39;re referring to are the result of PPT and PI techniques when the inverted tissue is tightly pulled down the center and connected to the vaginal canal graft. It&#39;s tight enough that you can feel this for a couple weeks after surgery. Once that is pulled down and tied into place, the surgeon then creates the labia, and places the urethra, and clitoral opening. There&#39;s considerable stitching that happens, some more than others. But the tension running down the center remains at the top area. This is the anterior Commissure. The tension is what causes those lines. Fortunately, as it decreases the lines become minimized. If you aren&#39;t satisfied with those results the surgeon can go back into the anterior commissure and have a second stage Labiaplasty to bring the top together and create a hood.
</p>
<p>
There are limitations to self-lubrication. You may have enough with PVT, but it&#39;s not arousal based, it&#39;s --all the time. There there are sensation limitations as well. Much of the tissue used for the vaginal canal and even labia, may not be innervated. This is a surprising fact, many surgeons don&#39;t bother telling us. I&#39;ll go a step further and say much of the information you should know prior to surgery --unless you specifically ask. They are under no requirement to disclose anything.
</p>
<p>
Now, the rest of your result will be heavily dependant on your own anatomy, even depth. Your pelvic region has its defined limits. Sometimes that&#39;s less that do desire.

Thank you, this was incredibly informative and I really appreciate it!

So then I just need to convince my insurance to cover a revision without there being anything dangerous or life threatening issues that necessitate it. Lol. Should be a blast. But the fact that they can &#34;fix&#34; it (not that there&#39;s anything wrong with it for those that like it) makes me feel much better.

Depending on where you are, it&#39;s not super complex to get insurance to cover revisions. Especially for something like this, it&#39;ll typically also fall under medical necessity for dysphoria.

I&#39;m in the US (Michigan) and have an Anthem PPO that has things worded very strangely. The coverage page for gender affirming surgery reads something like &#34;this policy covers gender affirming surgery as long as the provider can show medical necessity&#34;. There are no specifics regarding which surgeries are covered, and I&#39;m told that means we cover all of them (I work for the insurer as well). However, there&#39;s an exclusion specifically for revision surgeries as the policy considers them cosmetic except under special circumstances. I&#39;d be curious to know whether other people getting revisions covered have similar exclusions on their policies. I have no idea whether that&#39;s standard or not.
</p>
<p>
I guess I&#39;ll hang out on RBL&#39;s waitlist for a couple years and talk to her office about all this as well.
</p>
<p>
Thank you.

I believe Anthem changed their policy with the rewrite in March to include revisions as part of the original surgery. That is my understanding.

Well. This is all on you and doing the research you need to do to feel comfortable with the outcome. If you set aesthetic and functional goals, then you should proceed with those goals in mind and consult with surgeons that best fit those parameters. If these issues are critical to your surgery satisfaction, then I suggest to stick to your goals until you find a surgeon who makes you comfortable about moving ahead.  There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this approach. If you&#39;re under no time constraints or other pressure, make your choices that best benefits you and the potential outcome.

I asked my surgeon about the vaginal canal outside the labia minora (it&#39;s my case) and he told me this is standard procedure because there&#39;s not enough material to make labia minora that go all the way down.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure I follow the thing about the V. What bugs me about mine, besides the labia minora, is that I don&#39;t seem to have clitoral hood, but only the labia covers my clit. I wanted a hood piercing so bad :(

I definitely have the lack of connection at the top thing (Tina Rashid) but my vaginal opening is definitely within the labia (and indeed it&#39;s hidden without deliberate spreading). I&#39;m not a fan of the exposed opening look so I&#39;m quite pleased about that.

<p>
The exposed opening is something I associate with Thailand.

Are there any in Thailand which avoid exposed opening ? I basically do not want just a hole but not do I want  a vagina not anywhere near labia  I think a clitoral hood is essential  I ve heard many really happy with Tina Rashid approach it sounds good to me

I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m far from an expert in the Thai options available, it&#39;s just a pattern I&#39;ve noticed. I&#39;m disabled and so I ruled out international travel! I feel quite lucky I was happy with one of the few surgeons in the UK.

Regarding the clitoral hood, i wasn&#39;t entirely sure what I&#39;d get, but in the end the clitoris doesn&#39;t have a visible &#39;head&#39; and it&#39;s fairly well buried, so there&#39;s not really a need for a separate hood. It&#39;s definitely a fairly minimalist look but overall it&#39;s quite neat and the sensation is just fantastic so I&#39;m pretty happy overall.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not always sure I like the look of the clitoral heads I&#39;ve seen and I think I&#39;d be more keen on a hood if I had a more exposed one.

I did look at her results a year or so ago, but wasn&#39;t super impressed. I&#39;ll take a look through them again and see if things have gotten better.

I can’t say for sure because my surgeon left me looking that way, and yet there was a poster about 11 months after my surgery from the same surgeon that looked amazing and natural. So I don’t get it.

I know the surgeon and the other poster you are talking about! I wouldn’t really say that her result was better or more natural than yours as I generally think the surgeon you had produces very inconsistent and less and natural results for the most part with too many scars!

I’m so not happy with the surgeon in question. Between me and the insurance company they got over $122k out of the deal then wanted to charge for a consultation to “talk about next steps”. I’m like “seriously? as much money as you got for this the least you could do is a free revision”. So I ward people off from this particular surgeon.

I’m not surprised, I’ve heard that your surgeon in particular is very money centric apparently and in it for the money than the community! That’s very sad considering that this is a very serious surgery. You aren’t the only one that I’ve heard complaints about your surgeon!

Even with that, I’m still 10 times happier than I was. My bottom dysphoria outweighed any disappointment I may have now. And revision is possible (just didn’t expect to have to that’s all)

I found three or four surgeons who know nothing about anatomy of vulva yet still perform surgery on trans women which is sad and shouldn&#39;t happen.
</p>
<p>
Please select your surgeon carefully as first surgery is crucial. Revisions can be done but they can only do so much in many cases.
</p>
<p>
Natal anatomy is impossible; don&#39;t listen to what other trans women claim without seeing pictures.

I understand the concerns and this thread has been helpful in differences in techniques, but I will reiterate what others have said, that if you are looking for a completely unclockable vulva that is indestinguishable in every anatomical way, you should temper your expectations, and maybe triple down on researching as many surgeons outcomes as possible, while understanding there is still some variation (no two people have the same exact tissue to work with).
</p>
<p>
It is also important to understand that no surgeon, anywhere, can guarantee you won&#39;t have complications or things that effect aesthetics. A simple infection can cause problems. There is a difference between a bad or negligent surgeon (Rumer) and a tougher surgical outcome from chance coming from an experienced surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I have had concerns too about being clocked, I do rarely sleep with cis men and wish i didnt have to deal with any conversations, but the tech just isnt there yet. Thank you to everyone who gave more detailed medical explanations, and OP, I wish you the absolute best, whichever path you choose &lt;3.

The 2 doctors that seem to deliver good results regards to aesthetics and functionality is suporn and Theerapong, im a Theerapong girl and i went to him because he tends give juicy vulvas incase someone wants to get a revision down the line.

Thanks for the response.
<br>
Suporn has retired, but his results are exactly what I&#39;m referring to in my second paragraph. If you look at girls from who&#39;ve had surgery with him from either the front or straight on, we can see the three vertical &#34;lines&#34; that I&#39;m referring to.
</p>
<p>
I really wish I knew a better way to describe this without drawing an arrow on a photo, but I&#39;m not using someone else&#39;s photo to point out what I don&#39;t like.... So &#34;lines&#34; is really all I&#39;ve got

I think i understand i have the wide lines too and when i touch the middle of the 2 lines between the labia minora is slightly sensitive i think theres a medical reason why could be the dorsal nerve obviously they cant cut it and reroute it because theres a risk of losing sensation and even if sensation comes back the pain will be an absolute bitch when the dorsal nerve regrows trying to connect with your clit.

I appreciate the offer, but you look lovely and seem happy with your results. I don&#39;t want to take anything away from that, so don&#39;t really want to call out differences in individual people, ya know?

I know exactly what you mean about the &#39;lines&#39;, this is fixable by revision and Dr. Bank also delivers the same result.
</p>

Heres a post from someone here who had the revision and posted before and after
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/vwqyom/cosmetic_improvement_revision_by_dr_banks/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/vwqyom/cosmetic_improvement_revision_by_dr_banks/

YES! This is exactly what I&#39;m referring to! The revision helps a lot. I need to work with my insurance and a surgeon to figure out if revisions are covered - sounds like people have had good luck with it though.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d seen her end result photos, which look great, but was confused how she got such great results when the &#34;lines&#34; (really wish I had a better word for it) were there on most of Dr Bank&#39;s other work. I guess I could have looked through her post history. Either way, thank you for finding both of these for me!

<p>
for dr bank you do get a free* cosmetic revision and ofc any medically necessary revisions for free*
</p>
<p>
and i believe the technical term for where it connects is anterior and posterior labial commisure (anterior where the clit is, and posterior below the vagina). so in the case of 1st stage SRS you would have no commisure, and the revision creates one. correct me if i&#39;m getting terms mixed up
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t believe all surgeons can do this, even with a revision as most surgeons waste a lot of material and don&#39;t have enough to create the full labia minora as you said, which would make posterior commisure impossible. anterior should be though if i understand correctly
</p>
<p>
*technically included in the price of the first surgery which currently is 565,000 THB (roughly £13,000)

So as long as I find a surgeon like Bank who does place the vaginal canal inside the labia minora, it should be possible to correct any issues like that with the anterior commissure?
</p>
<p>
Obviously I&#39;ll discuss this with whichever surgeon I decide on, but this has all been amazing, thank you so much!

definitely discuss yeah, but theoretically it should be? 100% discuss with the surgeon though and more importantly discuss it with patients. i&#39;ve heard of patients being sold a false hope like that before

I believe suporn clinic includes one free revision. I am betting the can change this portion with the lines, and I know they can extend the minora into a posterior commissure. My understanding is they don’t normally do the first surgery with a posterior commissure due to difficulty with dilating.

When I saw mine I immediately started thinking of this, I started googling vagina and vulva examples and found a wiki with a lot of different pictures and most had the vaginal opening within the labia minora but also a lot had it below, I’m not sure they could neo vaginas or if this is normal in natal vaginas as well but it wasn’t as rare as I had thought.
</p>
<p>
Thai surgeons do seem to deliver more natal looking results.

Based on what I’ve seen on this sub, natal looking vulvas are absolutely possible from the right surgeon. I’m a non-binary afab person who lurks this sub for a better understand of gender affirming procedures so I can support my trans clients (I’m a therapist). I have a vulva of my own and I’ve seen pictures here that I would never have guessed were surgically created. The issue you bring up has been on my mind as well and my guess is these surgeons need more training.

Hey, thank you! I&#39;ll keep watching for more to come up that are closer to what I&#39;m hoping for.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the reassurance!

I don&#39;t care if my results don&#39;t pass I just want that fucking awful thing gone.  If srs wasn&#39;t available I&#39;d ask for a penectomy.   I don&#39;t care about high realism I don&#39;t pass and never will anyway

To each, their own. I&#39;m already unhappy with what I have down there, and this is not an easy surgery or recovery, often coming with complications. Personally, I don&#39;t think I can go through all that to still be unhappy with my parts in the grand scheme of things.
</p>
<p>
I wish you much success though!

You might want to have a look at my result, gonna post later in this year an update after revision for clitoral hood, despite having some of the issues you mention I&#39;m super lucky and don&#39;t feel I&#39;m off in any way, vaginas look so different and you shouldn&#39;t make yourself crazy about the outcome, you got good advice for good surgeons already, good luck on your journey
</p>
<p>
Edit:should post an update pic soon , the labia Majora look pretty tiny they do look really good now, probably still had some swelling going on when I posted my result

I think it&#39;s important to realize that having a vulva that 100% resembles a natal one is pretty close to unattainable.
</p>
<p>
The examples you brought up, to me, are actually some of the easier items to address as they can be handled in a future revision and there is actually enough variation in cisgender women that variation there is kind of whatever. There are some other things that medical science just doesn&#39;t have a way to deal with (don&#39;t want to go into too much detail and drop you into another rabbit hole).
</p>
<p>
Does it suck? Yes. Can we do much about it? Not really.
</p>
<p>
I think for all of us, it&#39;s incredibly important to accept the circumstances that we were born into to be able to find peace in our lives.

A few surgeons can do good work with this, most cannot.

This seems wrong to me:
</p>
<p>
1) It&#39;s not an all-or-nothing kind of thing. There are no two identical vaginas so there are bits I don&#39;t personally care about, but for instance in my case I care about the clitoral hood bc I&#39;d want a piercing there. Others can be bothered a lot about the labia minora thing. Others probably wouldn&#39;t mind even not having labia minora. Our stories are diverse.
</p>
<p>
2) A lot of trans women don&#39;t experience genital dysphoria and that&#39;s great. I didn&#39;t get my vaginoplasty bc I wanted to get rid of my penis, I loved my penis. There were things that were inconvenient about it but I in my case 100% disagree with your statement. Besides, there are a lot of surgical options to get rid of it, and vaginoplasty is only one of them.

After seeing photos and videos of cis women before undergoing a reduction labiaplasty, I stopped being afraid of what my neovagina would look like aesthetically.  Natal vaginas are usually hideous.  It is not a part of the body that should be pretty.
