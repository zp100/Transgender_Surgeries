When you have major surgery, you get major painkillers.  Except in Argentina, lol.
</p>
<p>
I have never taken opioids.  I was given some in the hospital and for a few weeks post op.  I was advised to take them as scheduled to stay ahead of the pain, and taper down as I felt better.  I started at 5mg of oxycodone in my Percocets 3x daily, down to two, down to 1/2 twice daily, to none.
</p>
<p>
Anyone who saw my post regarding post op depression, that&#39;s when it started.  When I was taking almost no oxy. Turns out, I hadn&#39;t hit post op depression yet.
</p>
<p>
Then I felt basically like I had the flu.  I knew it wasn&#39;t bc I&#39;m isolated.  Nausea, chills, sneezing, sore throat, and horrible body aches.  This lasted for three days.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally I felt fine emotionally.  Other times were as I described earlier.  Fear, depression, wanting to die, horrible anxiety.
</p>
<p>
Zofran helps with nausea, warm tea and fluids to help clear the system, something to calm you down and sleep for the pain, and a friend to hold your hand when you&#39;re scared, and you&#39;ll be ok.

I donâ€™t quite understand what you are saying. Was withdrawal the cause of post-op depression?

Yes
</p>
<p>
My doctor said that post op depression usually hits its peak around month 2.  Considering I had fairly severe physical withdrawals for such a short, light dose, the depressive episode I had last week was from the medication decreasing, and not directly from the surgery.

Is 6g per day normal there? The maximum daily dose is 4g from everything Iâ€™ve ever read, and paracetamol can kill you. Iâ€™d have though it would be better to add in some other painkillers.

I hate opioids and most of my anxiety about GRS was probably due to remembering what I felt like after the last time I had opioids.  I had them after my knee surgery a few years ago.  I took percocet for 2 weeks and ended up going through withdrawal after as well.  My surgeon gave me a prescription for oxycodone after GRS but the advil tylenol and gabapentin were thankfully enough to keep the pain at bay.  Gabapentin is a nerve pain blocker and I think that was the key in keeping the pain down.  Also worth noting that I had very little swelling which is a major source of pain for most people, but for anyone trying to avoid opioids if their surgeon didn&#39;t already prescribe gabapentin I would suggest asking about it.

I had gaba too.  The days when I could take three gabapentin and a Percocet? It was good.
</p>
<p>
And I agree about swelling being the primary source of pain and discomfort.  Opioids aren&#39;t even that effective with treating nerve pain, so after a few weeks they&#39;re not necessary.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m almost done with gabapentin, and it&#39;s no surprise I&#39;m getting random sensations of knives and shocks, lol.

I still got plenty of those shocks even with the gabapentin, but mostly in the more sensitive areas.  Its been just over 2 months since surgery and I&#39;m still getting occasional shocks from nerves connecting

Ffs taught me it will take at least a few.

<p>
Omg, my clitoris is starting to wake up and it&#39;s way too early for that.  In some ways, a little numbing was better

Not opioids.  There was a steroidal anti inflammatory similar to prednisone that worked well.
</p>
<p>
It wasn&#39;t a pain issue after the swelling passed

I&#39;m actually not considering going to Argentina for surgery after learning this. I can&#39;t deal with that much pain.

You don&#39;t have to take it.  Many people managed without, I chose to take a modest dose regularly to prevent anything.

I was miserable after ffs without them.  In Argentina I asked why I wasn&#39;t given any and they were like, you&#39;re not dying ðŸ˜®
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t smoke, drink hardly at all, or take marijuana in any form.  Oxy was amazing.  I felt my face go numb and could just relax.  Plus slight feelings of euphoria.
</p>
<p>
They gave me Dilaudid once in the hospital. But that&#39;s bc nightshift nurses don&#39;t like to work.  That knocked me out for six hours.
</p>
<p>
The medication definitely works, and in some cases is necessary.  They definitely shouldn&#39;t be the default pain management solution.

Iâ€™ve had opiates. I donâ€™t like them, but they are great when you need them. Obviously you need to use them with care.
