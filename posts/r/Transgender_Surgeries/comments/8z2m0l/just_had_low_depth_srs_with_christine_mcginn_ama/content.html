<p>
I&#39;m at day five post surgery and holed up in the Gaia house listening to the rain outside and REALLY looking forward to having the catheter out tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Like some others I&#39;ve read about here, I had a relatively short time between contacting McGinn&#39;s office in February and my surgery in July.  The wait seemed pretty interminable, but also super quick as there were a lot of tests and such to be done and my GP wasn&#39;t the most responsive. I got everything done though and all has proceeded according to schedule.
</p>
<p>
I talked a bit with McGinn beforehand about the low depth option; she didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t seem to be a fan of it- not sure why.  I had to get some additional therapy to confirm it&#39;s a good option for 1,000,000,000% lesbian me.  Christine &amp; I ended up agreeing (sort of as we&#39;re both very much &#34;alpha females&#34;) in the final consult before surgery. I think she just wanted to test my rather considerable resolve and it took that much to &#34;pass&#34; in her eyes.  That said, I think it&#39;s a decent policy since revisions must really suck.
</p>
<p>
The night after surgery was quite bad for me as I don&#39;t react well to anaesthesia.  The nurses spent two days pumping the pee out of me until my track loosened up and then it was like the flood of Moses.  At five days I have found I can&#39;t do any &#34;pushing&#34; or it will leak around the catheter- it will be great to have that thing out tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
I have had very little drainage or seepage. The nurses commented on how well I seemed to be doing.  I took no pain meds other than Tylenol before going to bed.
</p>
<p>
Lying on your back in those beds in the Barix clinic is BRUTAL.  A coiled towel under my back helped some and I periodically shifted it from one side of my back to the other trying to find relief through Not sure if it&#39;s the same for everyone but my back pain was by far worse than the surgical site.   Now that I&#39;m at the Gaia house (also run by McGinn), where they have proper mattresses, it&#39;s way better and my back pain is basically gone.
</p>
<p>
Sitting is a drag.  Moving from the Barix to the Gaia was was an &#34;experience&#34;. It turns out my tiny 85 year old ma couldn&#39;t resist using all of the 600hp in my car to delivery me very fast on the bumpy, twisty roads. Sitting, especially in a sport seat on a back road was bearable because I experimented with several cushions and got a nice thick foam one with a cutout.  No way I could have endured the ride here without it. My partner is flying down to drive me home since my mom has turned out be such a speedster. I&#39;ll give an update on what the rather long ride home to Boston is like next week.
</p>
<p>
Walking, lying down, and transitioning between the two have been very uneventful. The first time you get to walk in the hospital is fantastic!  The nurses basically had to make me get back into bed since walking and stretching was such a relief.
</p>
<p>
The lack of a skin graft and the reduced dilation should make my recovery a bit different than those of you with full depth procedures.  I had plenty of pre-op material to work with so I have a little over 3&#34; without a graft.  I&#39;ve had grafts before and am VERY glad I was able to avoid that part of the recovery and pre-surgery electrolysis. I friend of mine is undergoing electrolysis &#34;down there&#34; for her surgery with Metzner and has found it absolutely excruciating; I&#39;m not sure I would have the fortitude to deal with it so very glad my &amp; my partner&#39;s sexual preferences don&#39;t involve any sort of penetration.  I hope my recovery will be comparably less awkward and long as well.
</p>
<p>
The whole episode has been pretty anti-climatic so far honestly.  Since I&#39;m still in my surgery diaper I don&#39;t have any pictures but here&#39;s hoping it turns out gorgeous!

What factors did you consider when you decided to go with McGinn?
</p>
<p>
At what point do you plan on returning to work?
</p>
<p>
And thanks for the AMA!

Glad to share- I owe my happiness to the friends and knowledge I&#39;ve gotten from this community.  We are the best!
</p>
<p>
I always have wanted low depth so as far as my research found, that limited my options to her and Brassard in North America.  McGinn wasn&#39;t especially down with low depth (no skin grafts) but I talked with her and she was willing so I went with her because she&#39;s &#34;one of us&#34;, fellow ex-military, &#34;alpha&#34;.  The awesome way her office worked with me and BCBS made it a lock.  I&#39;m super happy with the decision thus far.
</p>
<p>
I said I&#39;d take a month off at work- that said I&#39;ve begun working already and have remote meetings setup all next week:)  Nothing like distractions to take my mind off the tedium of bedrest and low energy levels being off e for a month:(    I may go on Short Term Disability if working remotely after the month takes too much out of me and I&#39;d like a longer time to face the full brunt of work but I&#39;m hoping my low depth will  mean I&#39;m ready to rock by mid August.

Dugi in Portland does low depth. So does Crane in his team in SF. Many do perform it, but like 1-3% of patients want it, I was told.

I had heard similar but then whenever I talk among other MTF it seems like there&#39;s a hell of a lot of interest, far more than one to 3%.  I wonder what is behind it all because I found it really challenging to find a place

Do you know if the aesthetic result will be any different compared to if you went full depth?
</p>
<p>
I know its early days, but did she give any indication as to how the recovery would vary from doing full depth?
</p>
<p>
It would be interesting if you could ask McGinn what percentage she does like that, and how many, if any, regret it. Maybe ask her why she&#39;s not a fan?

I&#39;m hoping to talk more with her about the low depth care tomorrow.  She indicated I would likely need minimal to no dilation even with 3&#34; of depth. I&#39;ll ask a lot more about post-op care with Cristal who is much more accessible than McGinn.
</p>
<p>
She said she does &#34;very few&#34; which, in my limited experience, maybe because it seems like an overwhelming number of MTF transitioners are straight.  I know the overall statistics say otherwise, but all of the MTF I&#39;ve met through groups and such have been straight. I had a horrible, shitty experience with the full face electrolysis place in Chicago after which I made a decision to only deal with people who actually cared about us. I investigated McGinn initially because since then I have made a point of only dealing with lesbian trans medial practitioners. McGinn, my GP and my therapist are the only lesbian MTF I&#39;ve encountered IRL! Everyone else in groups and such have been bi or straight so low depth would seem like less of a useful outcome for anyone who would like to have a straight relationship. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a big force behind the number of low depth procedures but I do really want to get her take on it.

Why are people correcting me like this; Im talking about MY experience, not anyone elses and said directly I am aware my experience doesn&#39;t mesh with the stats!
</p>
<p>
My family has several gay and lesbians in; I grew up from a childhood among lesbians and gay people and couples. My parents were gay. Why does anyone feel the need to &#39;correct&#39; my experience?  Are my feelings or experiences hurting anyone?  I know this is reddit and I&#39;m supposed to be thick skinned and all but jees.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t need to be corrected over something I never even implied.  Look at my words. Anyway, rant off.

Your reasoning for not a lot of women getting low depth said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
maybe because it seems like an overwhelming number of MTF transitioners are straight
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And I said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You can enjoy penetration and be gay. 🤷
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
because you implied &#34;if you want depth you&#39;re probably straight&#34;.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s.. not.. correcting you. That&#39;s just saying me &#34;gay girls could want depth too&#34;. I literally wasn&#39;t critiquing your experience, I was
<em>
literally just
</em>
providing insight.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re the asshole in this convo, not me, cause you&#39;re just venting your frustrations at me, a random
<em>
other trans person
</em>
who has no issue with you. You probably had a bad day or something and my innocent comment just happened to hit you the wrong way and so you just decided to go off. Go see a therapist; I&#39;m not your emotional punching bag.

It would be interesting to know the average time taken off work for both procedures.
</p>
<p>
Was the cost the same?

The cost quote was the same but the procedure is obviously a bit simpler from the surgeon&#39;s point of view.  I think Brassard also charges the same regardless (he was my second choice). I&#39;ll post my costs when I get my EOB from BCBS.  I paid up front but also had pre-surgical approval from BCBS of MA upfront.  I think it will end up costing me mid-20s when I include the lab work, traveling, gaia (which is very expensive) and such.  It&#39;s a lot- but as we all know, transition is expensive and time-consuming.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m planning, based on pre-surgical conversations, to take at least month off in total- part PTO, part STD. I am already starting work meetings from my house on Monday (six days after surgery). Being off hormones for the surgery has made me a bit frantic and irrational than normal; I want to get my hormone levels back to normal before I have to be around work full time- one of my business partners is an aggressive and unsupportive guy whom I wouldn&#39;t want to deal with without E in my system.

I hadn&#39;t heard a lot of negative stories about brassard in fact I had heard mostly good from those who had been worked on by him.  I&#39;m also in Northern New England so he was the closest

According to the
<a href="http://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports#USTS" rel="nofollow">2015 US Trans Survey
</a>
figure 4.28 Sexual Orientation, trans women in the US are: 27% lesbian, 19% straight, 20% bi, 16% pan, 6% queer, 6% asexual, 6% unknown (bi/pan/queer total is 42%)
</p>
<p>
Like
<a href="/u/Bzttid" rel="nofollow">/u/Bzttid
</a>
said plenty of lesbians enjoy penetration, for example, over 50% in this survey:
<a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/how-do-lesbians-have-sex-288982/" rel="nofollow">https://www.autostraddle.com/how-do-lesbians-have-sex-288982/
</a>
. Also some trans women may want a full depth just for their own sense of how their body should be shaped.
</p>
<p>
But for the same reason, it&#39;s quite valid to not want full depth. So I don&#39;t want to sound at all like I&#39;m invalidating your extremely valid choice.  Glad McGinn was able to help you! I went to Papillon Center too and had a great experience.

makes sense :)  Yeah the trans folks I know don&#39;t match the stats either (in my case, mostly lesbians or otherwise leaning towards women/femme people). It&#39;s really interesting how everyone ends up in different bubbles like that.

One thing to be aware of, minimal depth does away with the need to dilate and you can be back to 100% with less than two months. However, longer term there is a high risk of &#39;internal detachment&#39; over the long term.  This means that the contact or adhesive area of low depth &#39;canal&#39; is less than &#39;full depth&#39; and has a higher risk of detaching. Think of it as the surface area of two pieces of skin glued together.  The risk of infection and complications is way less with low depth but this is this aspect to talk about with your surgeon.  Like most things about srs, it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s a lot of actual data on all of this so it seems there&#39;s an element of &#39;bro science&#39; level to me and McGinn says as much in her disclaimer- she&#39;s super straight forward which I appreciated.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any significant risks with full depth apart from difficult recovery, and if you do choose to stop dilating you&#39;re not worse off than doing this procedure.

Thank you. I found that a wonderful and thoughtful answer. I experienced grafts healing before for a trauma and that experience weighed into my analysis as well.
</p>
<p>
I felt peppered by several judgey edgelord types about my priorities and experiences during this thread. I don&#39;t get why folks want to project onto this process so badly.
</p>
<p>
As a point of reference, Dr. Mcginn displayed not even a hint of such arrogance. She and her PA were thoughtful and nuanced in our discussion.

You&#39;re not worried you&#39;ll regret not going full depth?

I know this is an older post, but how are you doing now? I am considering McGinn and possibly the low depth option too. Were you already on the east coast or did you have to travel? Im on the west coast so I think I&#39;d have to travel there for a consult? Anyway, hope everything is going well.

I&#39;m doing great (I think).  I&#39;m getting close to the magic 12 week mark (can ride my bike for exercise and :):):) as well:)
</p>
<p>
I am about a five hour drive away; she was very accommodating though for the consult- we did it over the phone but I&#39;m not sure if she does that as common practice. The consult was very matter of fact and useful.
</p>
<p>
I showed up two days before surgery and got situated, has another followup consult the afternoon before surgery.  After the surgery, I spent 4 days in the Barrix Clinic then another week at her guest house. There are lots of other options in the area for staying by the way; I&#39;m glad to answer any questions about the stay etc.
</p>
<p>
You have to do an in-person check up 6 weeks later (only took about an hour in the office despite my having some minor granularity) and then a second six months later.  So far, no difficult or painful complications. I really can&#39;t recommend low depth enough for transbians- the notion of having to shove something up into me would be yuck.

I honestly didn&#39;t ask a whole lot of questions other than getting some clarity on the recovery process schedule.  If you have preferences on what the end result will &#34;look like&#34; it&#39;s probably a good time to open that discussion; there options for having the clitoris &#34;hooded&#34; or not, etc. I&#39;m not sure how much custom work is advisable or needed but if you have desires I think that&#39;s a good time to discuss them. Insurance is also a thing- my insurance covered by hospital stay out of the gate and I&#39;m working on reimbursement for the rest of it.

How long did it take to get a consultation? How long did it take to get a surgery date? Thanks!

For me it was really rapid!  I called in February of this year, got a call back from dr. Mcginn in about a week.  Did our telephone consult in April and then they let me know that they had surgery dates at the end of June and  beginning of July so I took July cuz I figured it would take awhile to get all my tests done.  Life Pro tip-. There is a lot of prep to do before getting surgery

Wow that&#39;s so quick! I have my intake call with McGinn tomorrow. What kind of prep put of a squeeze on you? What I think I&#39;ll have a problem with is electrolysis down there..

I didn&#39;t have any electrolysis!  Big factor in low depth too as a friend is just dying dealing with it.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s an ekg, bunch of labs which quest and my gp made super difficult.

I am considering the same surgery, I might be even more lesbian than you are with your wimpy  1,000,000,000%   put a 3 in front of mine!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
My question is, why did you had her do a cavity at all?  I don&#39;t see the need for any hole down there at all!  It just is another place that allows old skin to accumulate and decay!
</p>
<p>
Is there any real life purpose for this cavity?  Or is it just for esthetics to look finished?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I would really appreciate your input on this!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
You wrote that this lady surgeon is the only one you know who is doing this.  I would need to find some surgeon in Florida, because my insurance will not pay anything for out state elective procedures.  Any hint how I could find a surgeon in Florida who does that kind of SRS?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Thank you for any help and I wish you further good recovery!

I don&#39;t know of any srs in FL; only ffs surgeons. Maybe your insurance company has a transgender rep who might have references?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s about asthetics I guess. I can&#39;t really see much down there:)

Thanks!  I have to check with the insurance.  I doubt it that they have any position like that, because Florida is so conservative it would make the catholic church look like a group of radicals!
