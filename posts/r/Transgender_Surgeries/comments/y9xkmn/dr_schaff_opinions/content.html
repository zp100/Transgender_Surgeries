I can&#39;t seen to form an opinion on Schaff. I&#39;ve been trying to research him all day, but it seems that opinions about him vary wildly - his double-op technique is either great or overly complated, his combined method is either a better version of PI or a worse one, he&#39;s either a genius pioneer or just a good salesman.
</p>
<p>
Are there any statistics, detailed accounts, personal opiniona that you can share from a possibility deeper analisys of his results? They seem to be really good but with some inconsistency, and I don&#39;t want to bet on something like this.
</p>
<p>
Any help is welcome, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èüíñ

Yeah, but I can&#39;t understand what&#39;s the mix. Is it one bad review in every hundred? Are half his results insufficient but those results aren&#39;t getting the spotlight they deserve? Etc...

There you might find some information and results
</p>
<p>
Also schaff isn&#39;t the only one doing this combined method in Germany
</p>
<p>
He·∫û in Essen and Morath and Sch√∂ll in Munich and Taskov in Munich are doing it too
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile team Markovsky is using a slightly different approach where they use urethra lining between clitoris and vagina and not inside the vagina
</p>
<p>
Also he is a transphobic sexist from what he said in a German radio show

I‚Äôm going to Dr. Schaff in 3 weeks!
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs how I made my decision:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
He has a notoriously good reputation. He‚Äôs done over 8,000 trans procedures since 1988 according to his website at least. He also has several peer reviewed studies you can google on his method detailing complications and reported satisfaction (however he is the primary author so take that with some salt)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I personally wanted to go for the more ‚Äúthai‚Äù style PI which is when the scrotum is used for the canal and the vulva is made of penile tissue. Also I heard many people experience natural lubrication from adding the urethral tissue. This is all anecdotal, however, when I asked Dr Schaff he estimated 50-60% reported being wet enough for penetration.  My own research made me decide that PPT or colon was not my first choice.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Personally I like the idea of a 2 step procedure bc it means they plan to correct ur concerns and reduce scaring. SRS is a war zone initially and getting it 100% right is difficult, knowing it will be revisited and perfected gives me peace of mind. The 2nd stage is optional by the way, many don‚Äôt go through it at all.  However I probably will, especially as it‚Äôs free for me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I live nearby, my public German healthcare agreed to cover 50% of the costs of the 1st OP and 100% of the 2nd. An obvious plus for me and not having to travel to Thailand!
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going for Schaff! I also got the appointment rather quickly and not having to wait years is nice.
</p>
<p>
Edit: idk where I remember the 2k mtf SRS number from 8k trans surgeries in general tho.

I ve been with Dr Schaff a couple of weeks ago and I am very very happy with the result. And no, he is not transphobic. If he were, he would not do these surgereys, right? Yes he is very self confident and proud of his work, but rightfully so.
