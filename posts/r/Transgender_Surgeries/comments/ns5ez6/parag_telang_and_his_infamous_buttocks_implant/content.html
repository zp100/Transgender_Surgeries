I am really sorry that looks rough.  As Lauren said, you need to
<strong>
have someone look at the infection ASAP
</strong>
.  I genuinely am sorry Lotus, no one should have to go through the pain, misery and recovery you face.  I&#39;m sure things will get better, but you&#39;re going to need time to recover, heal and for your body to adjust to what has happened.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if anyone will read and actually consider seeing this post.  But this is why implants of any type are dangerous.  And having implants, fat sculpting, or any surgery below your waist carries measurable risk of complications, because you sit on your butt much of the day day. All of the skin, fat and tissue below your waist has to move and shift for you to walk, drive, work, etc.  Having these tissues manipulated surgically is risky.
</p>
<p>
Most people don&#39;t know but fat sculpting and liposuction carry some of the highest rates of complications for any plastic surgery.  Please be careful everyone.

Thanks very much for your concern. But the central point here, is that: there&#39;s an infamous demon in Bombay, india called &#34;Parag Telang&#34;. He&#39;s a sweet talker and pulls you in trap flaunting/saying, he does great FFS and feminization of body surgeries. And, patients end up destroying their body, face, genitals which ever could get back to normal.
</p>
<p>
I know so many trans* patients across India who has permanently got damaged post GRS, FFS and body surgeries as performed by Parag Telang.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s developed a good marketing team (in collaboration with, white/Western people)- who does marketing for him. &#34;A business&#34; really- where commision is given with each and every &#34;trap&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I genuinely
<em>
do not
</em>
want anyone to suffer as I have, or so many patients have had- burning their hard-earned money.
</p>
<p>
Parag Telang is a SIN in the face of the Earth. There&#39;s legal and political complaints against him to thr government and medical council of India.

I agree, someone competent needs to look at that incisions between your buttocks. What are the abdominoplasty scars healed already? Were these from two different surgeries? Why go back for buttock implants if your tummy was already paralyzed?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m more interested in the reaction of the surgeon responsible for this. How does he explain this? Is he treating you?

Does that mean you paid upfront for both surgeries at the same time?

From the picture, it looks like you had sutures made of Black silk. As far as I know, no one is using them anymore and they use something better like mono filaments or nylon or resorbable ones. The problem with black silk sutures that it can accumulate dirt because of they way they are made and they don&#39;t resorb.  Go to the ER, get yourself strong antibiotics before things goes horribly bad. If there was a malpractice issue, you can sue that surgeon.

No, abdominal scars would never heal. They&#39;re permanent damage- both aesthetically &amp; functionally. My buttocks&#39; area and tummy area would never regain sensation- it&#39;s paralysed.

I&#39;m at a loss here. I feel so sorry for you this has been your result. It just seem far from anything acceptable it looks like the surgeon doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s doing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure this is a difficult situation for you and I don&#39;t want to downplay any of your experience. There&#39;s no excuse for this kind of result. Could you explain how the implant twist like that and distorted your entire buttock?
