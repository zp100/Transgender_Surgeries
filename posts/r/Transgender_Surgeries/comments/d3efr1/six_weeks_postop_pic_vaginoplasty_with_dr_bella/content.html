How was your experience with the Doctor? I believe she works with Dr Ting in NYC correct?
</p>
<p>
Were you pleased with the outcome? Were there any complications?
</p>
<p>
Did you have a standard penile inversion or a  peritoneal pull procedure?
</p>
<p>
My apologies for the personal questions, but I&#39;m most likely going to have my GCS at Mt. Sinai and, while there&#39;s a lot out there on Dr. Ting, I haven&#39;t seen a lot on  Dr. Avanessian

I love her tbh. Favourite medical professional I&#39;ve ever seen in my life bar none. She is very kind and considerate, seems to genuinely respect her patients, and is always quite positive to be around.
</p>
<p>
She does work in the same hospital and program as Dr. Ting yep! She graduated from a fellowship program at Mt. Sinai, fist trans surgery fellowship grad in the US.
</p>
<p>
I had sufficient donor material available so an abdominal peritoneal graft was unnecessary. However the tunica vaginalis was harvested and used as a graft to line the inside of my vagina so it gives the advantages of a peritoneal graft without the risk of additional surgery.
</p>
<p>
More details on it in the 4 week post op post on my profile.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m quite pleased with the outcome. IMO among the better results I&#39;ve personally seen. I have had some minor granulation inside the vagina that was treated with one stick of silver nitrate at 4 weeks. But that has been it for complications.

Do you mind explaining this tunica vaginalis graft you&#39;re talking about? Benefits?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never heard anything about it. I&#39;m already post op with Dr. Bank, so it&#39;s just a curiosity if you don&#39;t mind indulging me.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Also I&#39;m rude, I forgot to say your results look absolutely amazing and congratulations!!!

Thank you! I&#39;m quite happy how things worked out :)
</p>
<p>
So essentially the vaginal process differentiates in utero and when things go the way they did for us there is this structure called the tunica vaginalis. It is peritoneal tissue, it is squamous epithelium identical to the lining of the vagina in cis women. This tissue basically forms a pocket inside that envelops the two lower bits of the genitals.
</p>
<p>
Previously doctors were just discarding this tissue, but because Sinai is working to include peritoneum in their vaginas they&#39;ve decided to harvest this tissue and use it to line the graft that forms the back of the vagina. Due to the nature of the tissue it will colonize the vagina and will have the pink, moist, mucosa that would be expected.
</p>
<p>
It will help add self cleaning functionality, help maintain an appropriate ph, reduce the need for long term dilation, and produce some measure of lubrication. All the advantages of a peritoneal grafts basically

It is peritoneal tissue. There may be subtle differences but for the sake of this application it should be effectively the same.

I&#39;m quite happy so far. I would say the result is above average if you lined up all the vaginoplasty results I&#39;ve ever seen.
</p>
<p>
Everything is still quite in the middle of healing but I&#39;m able to move more, do more, feeling better

Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us--and CONGRATS on living a dream come true!!! Dreaming of it is something so many of us do--you know firsthand. And you made it happen! I can&#39;t wait to hear all of your updates. I especially want to hear more about how everything goes with the tunica vaginalis--amazing I&#39;m sure. I hadn&#39;t heard about this aspect before and it sounds like the next step in gender confirmation surgery.

Thank you! It&#39;s been a long time coming. Ten years on hormones it took to save up the money.
</p>
<p>
I got lucky and my insurance changed and actually covered it! And it was billed at in network rates so for all the business this year I had to meet my out of pocket max and that was it.
</p>
<p>
Because I was already close to that max the surgery and hospital stay, together billed at 93k, cost me just over 200$.
</p>
<p>
So now I have money! And I plan to fix my face in about 6 months lol. Not that I&#39;ve had a single incident where I didn&#39;t pass in those ten years but there are some things I want to fix.
</p>
<p>
I think true PPT that involves attaching the front of a vagina to a peritoneal flap which is cut to extend from the bottom of the abdomen from the inside, as an anchor point rather than a graft, might be more likely to be the full evolution here. But using the tunics vaginalis is better than using the peritoneal graft if you have sufficient donor material for the surgery. Just because it&#39;s less time, less work, and all the benefits.
</p>
<p>
And as I know this is a concern for many users in here, the orange dilator sits with the thumb notch between my labia, meaning somewhere 7.5-8&#34; of depth.

Thanks so much for sharing so many insights! Just amazing on so many levels--including the affordability. Sorry to ask the same question you often get, but can you share who your insurance provider is? Have they helped cover any other procedures, surgeries?
<br>
I&#39;m honestly still trying to grasp what you&#39;re saying about the full evolution of GCS haha, but it sounds like something to be excited about for those of us planning for it in the somewhat foreseeable future....(2-3 years?)
<br>
Heal up well and please do keep sharing info, as you are able to! Most importantly, enjoy yourself as *YOU*. &lt;3

I have Cigna
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had any other surgeries. I am interested in FFS but solely to be prettier. I haven&#39;t had any incidents in the ten years I&#39;ve been living my life.
</p>
<p>
A few doctors are doing a true ppt at this point, but aesthetics are also important to me and I liked Dr. Avanessian&#39;s aesthetics more. Functionally it&#39;s about 95% the same as true ppt. The only bit it&#39;s really lacking is attachment to the lower abdomen which would dramatically reduce need for long term dilation as it has a more solid anchor in that way. But my procedure already reduces that need as the inside of the vagina will be mucosal so when it is closed (i.e. not being penetrated) the moisture prevents the tissue from compacting together and shrinking like is historically seen.
</p>
<p>
The other thing is that true ppt leaves more skin available for labia construction. It doesn&#39;t seem that was much of an issue for me but it could be for some.

That&#39;s a harrowing story, without a doubt. How long have you been on hormones since resuming transition? I can&#39;t imagine making the decision to detransition after 6 years of living stealth. I mean I&#39;m just thinking about myself now, it would be like transitioning in the first place. No one knows me as that other person, I certainly don&#39;t know myself as that person. My whole career has been had as I am. Can&#39;t imagine reversing that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still in my 20s and it took me ten years to save up all the money I needed but I got lucky with the timing of advanced techniques and insurance coverage coinciding with me having the cash lol. Should allow me to get my face fixed up.

You look amazing.  How has the nerve pain been around the clitoris and which size dilatory did they start you with?

Sorry for the personal questions but I&#39;m 4 weeks now and I&#39;m learning there are so many differences in the recovery journeys we all under take.

So there was a lull in the nerve pain from weeks 4-6 but the past couple days I&#39;ve had lots of random jabs. I think it&#39;s two fold. 1 there is a bit of granulation around my clit and 2 some mostly dissolved stitching seems to be just hanging out nearby right now so that isn&#39;t helping haha.
</p>
<p>
I started with the purple dilator at day 6, and I&#39;ve been on the orange since week 4

Orange since week 4! Wow.  Very cool.  I&#39;m not slated to start orange until my 6 month mark but am on blue for the first 3 months since the packing was removed and then green for three months after that.

Sinai recommends going up in size as quickly as you can so I just went up one size per week basically.

I was with Stiller in Spokane WA.  Very specific dilating instructions were given with post op.  I&#39;ve seen so many different variants of post op care and dilation regiments that its interesting to know what others are doing and how it impacts them.

I can&#39;t say I&#39;m terribly familiar with their work! But I hope you&#39;re happy with how things are turning out.
</p>
<p>
There are so many variations! It can be a bit wild haha.

Like I only have to dilate twice per day as long as I&#39;m mindful of the fact that I&#39;m reaching the same depth every time.

Aesthetically it looks great, glad to hear of your positive experience with Dr. A because I am hoping to have her install my luxury steam powered supervagina as well. Best of luck healing! Feeling ok, physically, emotionally?

Thank you thank you, I think it&#39;s turning out well.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally I&#39;m going a bit stir crazy due to all the restrictions and stuff but I&#39;m otherwise alright.
</p>
<p>
No pain really anymore just discomfort and sometimes prolonged nerve stabs in the clit which get intense.
</p>
<p>
Mostly able to walk normal now so that&#39;s nice.

Impressive,  Do you live in NY, or did you travel?  Were you private pay or insurance? I had other questions, but they were answered in the comment section.

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
I do not live in NY so I had to travel. My insurance covered it. My out of pocket maximum is 3k, I was charged in network rates. I was mostly at that max already by the time I had surgery so the actual surgery was free and the hospital stay was about 200$. But ultimately because much of that 3k was spent in consults and other parts of the surgery you can say it cost me 3k.
</p>
<p>
Much better than the roughly 110k my insurance was charged if you include hospital stay, surgery, consults, visiting nurse service, etc etc etc.

I think people expect to browse their front page with NSFW material marked as such.

This does raise an interesting point. Why doesn&#39;t this sub automatically set all images to NSFW?
</p>
<p>
One can assume there would be lots of NSFW images on this sub.
</p>
<p>
I genuinely didn&#39;t think about it due to the nature of the sub, sorry about that.

No worries.  But like on my work breaks I&#39;ll be scrolling through everything, and you know my thumb will pause right on this as the charge nurse walks behind me to the fridge. 😂😭😣
