Everything I&#39;ve heard from you all about Siam Transformative has been overwhelmingly positive. In taking steps to book with them, I&#39;ve been informed they&#39;ve disbanded and reformed as
<a href="https://amanithailand.com/" rel="nofollow">https://amanithailand.com/
</a>
. The person I&#39;ve been talking to hasn&#39;t changed but as far as I can tell there&#39;s been no track record for this new company. Is anyone else in the process of working with them or have any more information?
</p>
<p>
Edit: I’ve been in contact with Becky and Cherry from Siam Transformative, they are both still taking care of their clients. But they have lost all other clients names and information due to this messy schism. If anyone would like to reach Becky and Cherry please use Facebook messenger. Becky Maneerut is the name on there. They will have a new website and Facebook page under the name Siam Transformation. I found Siam Transformative as an option thanks to folks shared experiences in this sub with Becky and Cherry so I want to make sure I shared this information.

I didn&#39;t want to respond until I heard back from Becky, but they didn&#39;t &#34;disband&#34; like Saphira told us, the tldr is she locked Becky and Cherry out and us poaching clients.  From Becky: Becky and Cherry from Siam Transformative are both still taking care of Siam Transformative clients. But they have lost all other clients names and information due to a co worker blocking them and taking all names. If anyone would like to reach Becky and Cherry please use Facebook messenger. Becky Maneerut is the name on there. They will have a new website and Facebook page soon.
</p>
<p>
Becky and Cherry are both nurses and have the actual caretaking experience so I&#39;d recommend reaching out.

You are totally correct Saphira is the actual founding company owner and still owns the Name and Internet domain - Becky is  as an old guard Respitory Thearapist not a surgical Nurse in any way - Saphira is a Transwoman who could see the need for a service dealing with post op care - I know personally Saphira&#39;s personal name and is/was a special needs teacher for NIST International Schools originally from New YORK USA - Saphira has worked in South Korea for some years and was working in Bangkok as a teacher until Covid started up .
</p>
<p>
Nurse ( Cherry ) from The Philippines and know her actual name also does a good job and not techniqualy allowed to really do any sort of Nursing in Bangkok ? However removing old sutures is not a biggy in my books as per se !
</p>
<p>
( Cherry ) got smitten with the money that could be earned from the scammer Becky who&#39;s married to a Thai man 40 plus years using her Husbands Bank account as a place to put pre surgery money  - Becky would over inflate the cost bye thousands pay Dr. Theerapong and pull the rest out for personal use bottom line !
</p>
<p>
When I was there fall 2022 I new something was wrong and for a time I was on the &#34;Sh#t&#34; list with Saphira but as things went on she realized &#34; I was on the money &#34; 100 % about this  Siam Transformative crap going on about client money and  fell into a mess because of Becky&#39;s pure Greed going on and using her Husbands Thai Bank account for the business !
</p>
<p>
BECKY is CIS born and got connected to Saphira as a teacher for NIST Schools for  Special needs children but grew up in Thailand as her father was an American Stationed at the Military base in Thailand  - learned to read and write and of course speak  fully fluent in Thai going to school in Thailand - this is where the connection became paramount for Communication running the original ( Siam Transformative ) For the 1 st time Becky was able to see a money making business in her life if she was part of it .
</p>
<p>
Becky has used almost the original name ( Siam Transformation ) to grab past medical clients and future clients and is not  much more than a Taxi Driver in reality , she  does enough to grab the money and nothing else !  she&#39;s not the founder but could speak fluent Thai but otherwise would have never been involved with any SRS Surgeries without Saphira who actually cares and went through many of these surgeries unlike Becky !

I think it’s important before you make accusations to fact check before hand. I know Saphira personally and what you’re saying is far from the truth.

Care to elaborate? I&#39;m speaking to Becky and this was her account so at the very least everyone&#39;s not on the same page and this wasn&#39;t a smooth transition.

Well you know I was there last Nov. and sensed some crap going on with Becky and lies wanting more and more like I was a money tree - of course I can see Saphira which is not her real name and also an EX USA Patriot living in Bangkok also trying to defend Siam Transformative at the time not seeing money disappear from Paitoons ( Siam Transformative ) bank account which is Becky’s husband she married 42 years ago - to open a business in Bangkok you need to be Thai born and to own land same thing , Becky could not get a business license even though she was married to him as an EX USA Patriot - Paitoon technically is the actual owner , not Becky !
</p>
<p>
I paid a lot of money and felt post op un-finished surgically and never got even a personal introduction let alone a consultation ,I did  get an examination the day before , that’s it ,can you imagine not talking to the surgeon, I expected this for sure , never happened - Dr. Theerapong does world gender and surgical conferences on gender care , these conferences are always done in English so there’s No excuse not to have a consultation with him - in other wards Becky new this but kept quite and hoped I’d be stupid while she talked up a storm in Thai taking advantage when the guy speaks English anyways WTF ! really , a scamming lie to me ! without my input at all for serious surgery , Becky this idiot has never had a serious surgery like what I got , she doesn’t have clue what it’s really like , it’s my body not damn Becky’s body being cut open , I’m livid with this crap I went through in Bangkok , Bad enough dealing with the Kamol Gong Show in 2019 - it was all about money !
</p>
<p>
I have Wise banking proof of spending 24k Canadian and never got a full redo Labiaplasty and why not ? Aside from the Sigmoid colon Vaginoplasty that was done and minimal aesthetics quite frankly because I could never talk to the fk’ing surgeon - it makes me wonder if she didn’t want me to talk as it would screw up the extra money needed for a full Labia Plasty 10 days later that she scooped for her self as profit !
</p>
<p>
Becky At 62 would never open a business up at this age and does not have the brains, smarts to run it quite frankly  but she could speak,read,write  Thai and had a vehicle she drives , basically the Taxi Driver for Siam and was married to get a business license -  the EX patient of Theerapong ( Saphira , M.A.M , 42 years old now ) who lost her job with NIST international schools as a teacher during Covid 2020 ? about and obviously wanted to stay in Bangkok instead of going back to the USA to find another job because of a Work Visa that would run out in Thailand then hitched up with Becky Maneerut who I believe has grand children in school there so a connection was made with Saphira  - Nurse Cherry ( Rivka ) used to work for Theerapong when more and likely when Saphira had surgery with him Dr. Theerapong she had a brain storm and a guaranteed way to stay in Bangkok forever with a guaranteed work Visa and so started Siam Transformative - Saphira is the brain child of Siam Transformative .
</p>
<p>
Becky has limited knowledge of these kinds of surgeries despite being a Respiratory Nurse from years ago and was still supposedly working in the US as late as 2015 and obviously travels back and forth to Thailand to the USA - her husband Paitoon and knows nothing about surgery owns a small house in Bangkok and she has a SUV in Bangkok - so teaming up with Becky known from Saphira being a teacher with NIST and schools seems how there connection was made ? , I maybe wrong but makes sense , doesn’t really matter anyways ? along with Cherry ( Rivka ) after Saphira had surgery- it was a brain storm to be able to stay in Bangkok.
</p>
<p>
I think a lot of my money was squandered by Becky/Cherry , I’ll never know and why I never got a full Labia Plasty because there was nothing left to pay Dr. Theerapong to do it let alone have a consult keeping me away from him based on fear he only spoke Thai which isn’t true and making sure I was officially in the Mali Hospital to secure funds that went into Paitoons bank account - So fk’ing dirty  this whole thing now .
</p>
<p>
I noticed Becky strutting around like she was the big business woman with all this new power and a so called important big business woman when she had “ 0 “ experience other than working for someone else prior her whole life - I noticed this 1 st moment I met her - I will say Cherry may have got caught up in this situation as she was quite competent dealing with me when there and Dr. Theerapong is still a good surgeon despite this Siam fiasco - anyways it’s caused trouble with everyone and it appears I’m black listed with Interplast , basically screwed now !
</p>
<p>
When there I asked Becky  about Saphira the 1 st day and the reply was “ oomph  ! I never see her much either “ like she was the supreme knowledgeable big boss strutting her feathers but then at the Hospital I asked about being weighed and she said “ if they don’t ask we’ll say nothing “ it was securing her money by getting me in not safety really !
</p>
<p>
Becky wanted another 2k for this tummy tuck when there using the same opening to access the sigmoid , I was tapped out at 24k Cad money and then surprisingly during his physical just the day before  Dr. Theerapong started to mark off on my skin to do it anyways and I get this dumb puppy dog fake  look from Becky saying I guess he’s going to do it anyways as though it was Dr. Theerapong who was giving me a bargain for Becky  to “ Save Face “ and look good and honest and cover her scamming butt when in reality it was her extra ! extra ! profit gone down the toilet scamming me before any hospital stay in the Mali Hospital and days before she was demanding more and more - she got fooled because he did it anyways and it was extra scam money she lost thinking I was that stupid not to see this also !
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot more I could say about all this sh#t going on with Siam Transformative at the time !

Hi Krystal. I was waiting or you to add some lies. You know that none of that is True and if you are interested in any of the things Saphira said about I have them all, I have everything that was ever said. I DID NOT get a penny from you. You had your consultation the day before you went in the hospital. You had your chance to ask any questions but you didn’t. I only translate what you say. You didn’t do anything we asked to do and popped a stitch. I sent it to Dr Thee and he said it was ok and to take you in on Monday and he stitched it up. Again you kept doing things you weren’t supposed to do. You weighed much more than you told us. You said you didn’t have enough money to pay another BMI. Don’t blame me for any of that. You begged him to do a tummy tuck. He charged you much less than than what he normally charges because you played a pity party. Then you bad mouthed Dr Thee that he should have pulled up the skin from your vagina. That’s not part of SRS or tummy tuck. Saphira is the one that argued with you and had a mouthful to say. I can prove that every penny went to Dr Thee and we didn’t get any commission from it just helping you out. Deformation Law is strict here so better think twice before coming up with all these lies.  And for your information Saphira quit her job at Nist and begged me to help them with Siam Transformative. So again get your stories straight and be honest.

I&#39;m really uncomfortable that you are now outing people&#39;s real names and private medical information. You&#39;re a retired nurse from the US and you don&#39;t honor medical privacy, informed consent, HIPPA, etc? Yikes.

I totally agree and I’m sorry it’s come to this but you see all the lies that’s coming from friends and not clients. Becky and Cherry are real names and lots of stuff medical info that has no truth is coming from them. I agree it needs to stop. I will be the big girl to stop. Thanks for reminding me that this is wrong.

There’s No lies from me and can I tell you I never had a one on one consult ever with Dr. Theerapong only a 1 hour physical exam the day before surgery , nothing was offered , I’m too experienced and traveled world wide not to see this , I’m not playing games either here - he speaks English so there’s No excuse - a stitch popped because because I had to stretch the crap out of my right leg trying to get out your SUV because you parked to close to the front bumpers of other cars and you thought I was just making up a lie at the time , unbelievable   - to fix this popped stitch wasn’t done for over a week and a half and by this time It was too healed after having 6 days in the Mali Hospital initially long  before a re-stitch almost 1 week before going home and it  was too late - the so called wheel chair at the Hospital mentioned by Saphira on her tirade against me was too small for me to use leaving the Hospital - anyways it doesn’t matter anymore I’m healed the way I’m healed and it’s obvious because of all this crap going on with you 3 having a proper labiaplasty is never going to happen as paid for to have a Sigmoid colon and aesthetics to really talk about the latter with him personally of not having a consult and it was offered by you stating this , as patient I’m far from stupid , it was never offered with Dr. Theerapong - don’t ever tell me I refused a proper consult - I’ll also add I’m American foot ball player size 240 lbs 6’ tall stalky and still strong as an Ox at 65 now and never bitch about pain either like many who have Vaginoplasty’s ? and I’m not some 130 lb Lady-boy in Bangkok and my  BMI for a large heavy boned person is not accurate with the BMI tables you spout off of being over weight , I was not over weight just a damn big person that there not used to dealing with - too many lies from Siam - I’m sure you’ve spread lies  to Dr. Theerapong covering your butt anyways - there’s No defamation on my part if that’s where your going with me !!

Wow that sounds messy. It sucks things have been rough for all parties. The truth is, Becky and Cherry being the registered nurses on the ground and highly praised by folks on this sub are the reason we reached out to Siam Transformative at all. Saphira pointing us to a new website/bank account with no info to contact the others to give us the choice in who we would go with, read as shady enough to me to make my original post. It&#39;s true my original language to describe the situation was reductive, my apologies, but as a client I feel taken advantage of.

I hope they fix this in the court. I was a client of Siam Transformative, and Becky and Cherry took good care of me. Sapphira was there as well. (not as close contact as the two other girls, but...)
</p>
<p>
I do recommend taking direct contact with cherry tho. She was the most hands-on out of those three ladies

You are the one that needs to both sides. Saphira was CEO because she asked to be. Papers are signed that we are all equal. She invested nothing. Originally she was asked for a $10,000 investment with another company that she found out was lying then she backed out of the investment. After that all 3 of us decided to start up Siam Transformation. She did not come up with the name. All 3 sat down and decided. She then had her friend create the website without consulting anyone,  and said it was $2,500 when she was asked about it she said she didn’t care, she would pay for it, it will be her investment. Of course she had to invest. She brought nothing to the table. Cherry is a nurse and had 10 years experience with Dr Thee taking care of SRS patients. Becky, a nurse of almost 40 years, speaks, reads and writes Thai fluently and also brought her 1.5 million baht vehicle in to the business. I have never cheated her out of even 1 Baht, yet alone thousands of dollars. If anyone is working behind the scenes is her. She first blocked Cherry because we didn’t agree to let her split Cherry’s extended after care packages. The client decides to have Cherry extent the care for more days. That’s is Cherry’s extra money. It was decided like this from the beginning. She blocked Cherry from everything. And when I asked her about it, she blocked me too. All of this happened when I was on vacation visiting family in the US. Then she wanted us to buy her out. I said NO WAY. Then she wanted Siam Transformative to fold. We agreed to take care of the last 4 clients. So of course we are taking care of patients from Siam. The company is legally still running because the legal matters are not yet final. Not sure if you know but deformation laws in Thailand are brutal. And if I need to I won’t think twice about facing anyone in court. So I don’t care who you are you better think twice before posting all of this. Just because you know her personally or are her yourself. Don’t accuse us of anything unless you know the facts. We have the right to all the names and emails of all of our clients. They are the ones who contacted Siam. No one reached out to them first. I will continue to work with the community and help everyone I can. I am an hard honest worker and don’t appreciate being accused of cheating anyone. THAT IS DEFORMATION

Hmm interesting, I&#39;m 2 months post op srs+ba from dr theerapong &#34;through siam transformations&#34; As far I know saphira she never met me once nor before srs or after. It&#39;s like she  just registered a website and advertised it on few reddit pages to catch clients for dr theerapong. On the other hand dr theerapong hasn&#39;t been affiliated with these agencies except interplast which is a clinic where all your checkups and dues are cleared. Interplast, they don&#39;t deal in aftercare like some other agencies do like siam was doing but unfortunately they&#39;re apart. I don&#39;t know saphira or becky in person but cherry she&#39;s the actual professional person who do each and everything for you, from my side she&#39;s was the siam for me! An advice, if anyone is afraid of sending payment to a new company then consider interplast they receive clients payments through actual dr theerapong bank account. (just pay for your surgery, and bring cash for the aftercare provider)  For aftercare you can choose any agency you comfortable with I personally loved cherry and the way she took care of me.

Are you confident they&#39;re still the same? I&#39;m still on the fence since I don&#39;t speak Thai and can&#39;t verify the business

I was just going by the fact that you mentioned you were informed. I last spoke to Becky, now about a year ago, I think.
</p>
<p>
Looking at Amani&#39;s sparse socials also makes me question them. I haven&#39;t reached out to them yet, but it does make me raise an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I&#39;ve been engaging with Jane Med, and am happy so far with Mayra. She&#39;s straightforward and helps you choose the most affordable option, without making you feel like she&#39;s just grabbing your money. That&#39;s been my experience at least.

The person I&#39;ve been talking to (sapphira?) still has the Siam Transformative banner and email, but I&#39;m nervous about the finances being given to a completely new compan with no track record. If you&#39;re able to reach out to your contact and have them confirm the new name I&#39;d feel a bit more comfortable moving forward with them.

Of course she has the banner and email. She took it and blocked everyone else.  I’m hoping everyone waits this out and see where is goes. Don’t trust anyone with your lifetime savings. Look at the facts. Think about the person that will actually care for you. Ask many questions first. Then decide who you want to care for you.

I see that I last spoke to Becky Maneerut in January 2022 on Facebook. If you DM me Sappira&#39;s email address, I&#39;ll see what floats to the top, and let you know.

Mind you, Becky&#39;s profile still mentions she&#39;s the COO for Siam Transformative, and she&#39;s still active on Facebook. So, I would also be cautious until proven otherwise.

Okay. So, I&#39;ve just reached out to Becky. There have been some shenanigans. Amani Thailand is not her company. She and Cherry are still operating. It&#39;s best to message Becky via Facebook.

BTW, I DM&#39;d you.

Previous patient here (to verify; I am a real person and not linked to either parties please refer to my post history), there are so many things I could say…
</p>
<p>
There were great things about Siam Transformative, in time I will discuss my concerns and experiences, again, these are MY experiences.
</p>
<p>
I can attest to Saphira’s character, pre-booking and following my deposit placement, pre-planning and time in Thailand, I clicked with Saphira. We have remained in contact the past 18 months since my SRS.
</p>
<p>
Saphira struck me as an ally, aware and emotionally intelligent. Practically, Saphira was also meticulous in advising me around my surgery, attentive to every question I had and also very aware of how sensitive and vulnerable I was being so far from home and in pain. Genuinely and overall, Saphira is the safest person to guide me through this journey.
</p>
<p>
During my trip, I noticed a few things and again, in time, I will explicitly lay these all out. What I will say is; when new patients or previous staff members tell you confidential information about yourself you shared and discuss this jokingly, that’s when I knew my instincts were right. Patients ability to ‘pass’ was openly discussed with me and particular staff members stated they still read and call said patient(s) using male pronouns, again not a safe environment for any trans women undergoing gender affirmative care!
</p>
<p>
Regarding the current controversy, those women were like a family and Saphira called Becky “mom”. It is really sad how this situation is being aired out for the world to see. Clients have the right to know the truth. I can assure you, Becky is not the victim here. The misconduct, particularly of Becky, is being addressed legally. I encourage anyone who is questioning any of this to consider speaking directly with Saphira. Also, make sure you are sending money into proper business bank accounts and directly check with the clinics about the prices of surgeries. I know these were some of the many points that led to the ladies’ differences being irreconcilable.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy to answer any questions any ladies have.

I new something was wrong last Nov. 2022 with this Becky and communication and money going into her husbands account - she wanted more and more and would never allow me to have a proper consultation with Dr. Theerapong at all - hiding too much and shear greed - I’ll never know what was said in Thai language to the doctor while she kept funds from her husbands account the real owner of Siam named Paitoon and divvy’d the money out to Interplast minimally and I ended up with joke aesthetics post op because Dr. Theerapong more and likely was short changed financially and did only what he was paid for in surgery from Becky SOB  person Becky US EX Patriot scammer ! - I’m livid about this sh#t quite frankly - jail time is needed in a nice Thai prison sleeping on the the floor with 60 other women for 15 years will teach a good lesson and Becky being about 64 won’t get out till she’s almost 80 if she gets convicted in a Thai court - I was right on the money about this months ago and black listed with Interplast now also Wow ! So dirty !

Becky and Cherry are now part of Siam Transformation and they have a website now:
<a href="https://siamtransformation.net/" rel="nofollow">https://siamtransformation.net/
</a>
</p>
<p>
I had SRS before Saphira did dirty on Becky and Cherry. During my recovery, it was mostly Becky and Cherry I had contact with. Cherry is the nurse that I have met at least twice a day to dilate me and bring some food ☺ Becky came a few times.
</p>
<p>
I remember that I booked my SRS via them because of Cherry (I&#39;ve heard good reviews about her), and if I get new surgeries, I&#39;ll still book it on whatever company Cherry&#39;s working with.

Yes, I’ve been informed that Becky and Cherry are still working together because I reached out with some post-care SRS questions and the possibility of getting breast augmentation in the future. (I went with Siam Transformative for SRS last July and wanted them again for future procedures)

How have you been contacting Becky? We reached out on Facebook since it seems Siam Transformative&#39;s tech can only reach Sapphira at the moment.
