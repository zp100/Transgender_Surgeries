I am currently looking for SRS options. Does anyone have experience with the above mentioned procedure and / or surgeons doing it?
</p>
<p>
Where did you go? Thailand? India? How did it go? May I ask you a few questions?
</p>
<p>
Would be lovely to hear from someone ðŸ’•ðŸŒ¸

Surgeons from the U. S. are going to be too expensive for me. I have, at best, about 25k â‚¬ available.
</p>
<p>
But may I ask:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Why did you decide to go with Peritoneal (Pull-Through)?
</li>
<li>
True that you have to do quite extensive dilation in the first few weeks / months?
</li>
<li>
Since you now have quite a different vaginal lining as opposed to penile inversion do you have to be more careful about lube / condoms you use for dilation?
</li>
<li>
Was it necessary to do any hair removal beforehand? (That&#39;s probably quite dependent on the surgeons you choose I suppose)
</li>
</ul>

Seems like the closest type of material to a cis coochie and is what is typically used for cis women who get vaginoplasties. On top of that, having to douche essentially permanently or be stuck with dealing with internal dead skin build up from PI would make me super dysphoric. It&#39;s also less invasive than colon method and i can just go to a normal gyno instead of a specialist to get to get everything checked out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My schedule seems pretty easy compared to other surgeons. Each session is at least 10 minutes at full depth, and i need to do it 3 times a day for 3 months, once a day til 6 months, and it gradually decreases from there.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not that I know of, all seems pretty standard. I dont use condoms to dilate tho, idk if thats normal
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It was highly recommended but not required for me. I had 4 sessions of electrolysis done and it was way too traumatizing for me to continue so I stopped after that, still had a good bit of hair left. Havent had any issues so far, all the hair seems to be in normal places

Looking for the same kind of information. The only non-US names Iâ€™ve heard so far are Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic and Dr. Kamol. I was going for Dr. Kamol but some people show concerns about, which I think could have been clarified but the hospital was refusing a video call appointment with him before I went to Thai for surgery. That made me so anxious I gave up.

In Thailand it seems to be only Dr. Kamol (who seems to have quite a fair number of patients) as well as Dr. Theerapong. The latter one works with the Interplast / BCSS clinic. Barely known outside Thailand and their English isn&#39;t really great. Kinda hard to communicate with them :/
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t heard of Miroslav yet. Gotta look him up.

So do you think their reservation with me having an appointment by video call could be because of his English?  If that is the case it is such a bummer :(  I still want do some research mainly to see if I can find someone here in Europe or maybe in Brazil (my home country) either would make things easier than trusting going to a country in which I would have no legal protections or guarantees and not even being able to talk to the doctor.  Not saying I donâ€™t think he does a good work, I do. But still would love to have a little less to worry about.

No, no. I meant that it is hard to communicate with the Interplast / BCOSS clinic of Dr. Theerapong.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea why Dr. Kamol didn&#39;t agree to a video call... Maybe they just don&#39;t do things like that?

I havenâ€™t noticed before, but some people pointed to a  weird anatomy problem on most of the photos you see in his website. The vagina hole is bellow the labia, not between.  The girl from the clinic I was talking to told me those were photos from Japanese girls who usually ask for that. So o wanted to talk to him to be able to ask about it and to be sure I wouldnâ€™t get something so weird.  Besides I had a bad experience with my FFS (with another doctor), mainly because the doctor didnâ€™t clarify some risks before I traveled, and only told me when I was there and a bit too late to cancel. If I knew before hand I wouldnâ€™t have done it with him. So I also wanted to hear from him whatever I should be worried or not about.

I won&#39;t be able to go to the US, since it&#39;s going to be way too expensive for me.
</p>
<p>
- Are there any specific things relating aftercare? Something very different than aftercare for PI for example?
</p>
<p>
- Why did you choose PPT instead of sigmoid colon? While I am mainly interested in PPT I realise that the other options is quite good too. Tho... I think sigmoid colon actually comes with a higher risk of complications.

In the short term, not that I know of. In the long term PPT is supposed to be easier than PI.
</p>
<p>
Risk of smell and risk of complications scared me. Also I like the NYU/bluebond aesthetic that Dr. Jun does. Oh and I didnâ€™t want to need to wear a pad forever.

Thank you so much for your answer. One more question:
</p>
<p>
- Does Dr. Min Jun ask for any hair removal upfront, and did you do it?

I already had hair removal when I approached him, but my understanding is that itâ€™s strongly encouraged but he doesnâ€™t turn people down for not having had hair removal.

I got PPT with Dr. Bonnington. My only complaints are that hood is too small and my cannel to short. Both arenâ€™t really his fault, but itâ€™s hurts to go through all this extra stuff to not get 6+ inches like Iâ€™ve heard other girls get. Especially because I
<em>
stressed
</em>
how important depth is for me. Let me know if you have questions!

This was my first! So like I said over all great surgeon and so far experience. Iâ€™ll just need revision probably, maybe the colon version for lengthening. Iâ€™ll have to see.
