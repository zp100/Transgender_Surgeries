I&#39;ve noticed lots of posts from the past asking for help and info on him. But it seems people never follow up on their own personal experiences with him or Mass General. In one hand it is good to see no bad news about him. But on the other hand it is troubling to find no good news or really any info about his FFS at all.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve checked out Spiegel ( NO way!) and Shaye @ Eye and Ear (Says wild card too much and is a little dismissive.. I had my nose done with him. Bridge and and breathing issues are fixed! thank goodness. But the nostrils are different from one side to the other. Not the end of the world. But a lil disappointing.)  He doesn&#39;t give me confidence whenever we have spoken about the next steps.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
So now I am with Bojovic. My insurance has approved the procedure. (MassHealth) He has the most confidence and the most technology available. But no actual information by anyone. He even said there wont be much of a scar if any at my hair line. Not sure what technique that involves but the only ones that ever told me that there wont be much or any of a scar is Facial Team in Spain. (when I was considering them)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m super nervous and scared and start bursting into tears feeling like I am just taking a chance and walking in the dark hoping I don&#39;t walk into a wall. I hope I come out if it with more happiness and confidence and maybe... just maybe my agoraphobia will be eased and I can improve on my life.. hopefully.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I always thought I was pretty &#34;Passing&#34; as just some other chick in the room. But things seemed to have changed as I entered my 30&#39;s. Things started getting scary and I started to hide away. Life is just slipping by and I&#39;ve spiraled into a dark place. I just want to be happy with myself and not feel like a topic or target.
</p>
<p>

<p>
If anyone has information and are willing to help out, please do. Feel free to private message me if you rather.

Thank you for your time.

Publicly, I’ll share from my own experience. I found out about him because he was the only FFS surgeon my insurance listed as an FFS provider.
</p>
<p>
In my research I deduced he is a very talented surgeon. Some things of note: “he was a member of the team that performed the world’s most comprehensive facial transplantation, to date, in March 2012.” [1]  “He completed a craniofacial microsurgery fellowship at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of Maryland R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center. He brings expertise in adult and pediatric craniofacial surgery and microsurgery.  Bojovic has received numerous clinical and volunteerism awards and recognitions throughout his career.” [1]
</p>
<p>
So I felt confident enough to see him for a consult because he obviously was a skilled facial surgeon.  In one of my consults with him I asked about his background with FFS. He is newer to FFS for trans patients, he started a few years ago when MGH began its trans health program (another user mentioned this too). He has seen (a number I can’t exactly remember… maybe 20-50 range) of patients for FFS since then and during my consult he showed me examples of results for FFS clients he’s performed surgery on in the past.
</p>
<p>
Interesting and not entirely relevant _ He is not new to trans surgery research, he has been involved in teams that were researching bottom surgery for trans masc ppl.
</p>
<p>
He also told me he has been doing FFS more regularly lately.
</p>
<p>
Through my consults for feminization of my face, I am confident he understands the fundamentals of FFS. I was surprised that he did not know who Kyle Keojampa is, but I hope that after I mentioned him, he looked him up lol. He is very kind and he explains things well. He does not pressure you to do any procedures you’re not comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
The one thing about him I am still on the fence about is that he does not do ffs of the whole face at once. He does it in 2-3 rounds of surgeries. I’ve pushed him on why and the best answer I’ve gotten is that it’s too many hours in surgery all at once. Both for him as a perfectionist and for you as the patient. He also feels that if you do it in sections (upper face first then lower face) you can process your results better and assess how you feel about them. I am not sure I am keen on having to heal twice from surgeries, but after I’ve had both I can say more on this.
</p>
<p>
His aesthetic approach to facial feminization is “subtle but powerful changes.” Which, speaking for myself, is exactly what I am looking for in my FFS results.
</p>
<p>
He uses cool technology where he uses the 3D CT scan of your skull to create custom and precise measurement tools for your surgery. He also has mock ups of these created and he shared these files with me, which I appreciated.
</p>

Let me know if you have any questions! As I go through the process in the next couple of weeks—month, I’ll try to update more on my experience. I’m anxious and excited!

Thank you for sharing your experience! If you feel comfortable, can you tell us what procedures you had done? I’m anxious about the healing for my forehead and orbitals!

Incredible! I really appreciate the info. I&#39;m happy people are reaching out. This thread will help many others who don&#39;t know where to turn.
</p>
<p>
I had read about his success with mentioned surgeries. It definitely gave me some hope. If he can redo an entire face than ffs should be a breeze for him.
</p>
<p>
I noticed that both he and Shaye (MEE) do ffs in three parts for the same reasons. At first it was a turn off because of going under the knife and healing a bunch of times and everything taking three times as long to complete. But I understand. Who knows if I&#39;ll be happy enough with just doing my nose and forehead? Right? That might be all I need for all I know.
</p>
<p>
I will admit to some bumps in the road while communicating with his team. I started talking to them back in the beginning of the year. (2021) I had a lot of trouble getting my first appointment because his &#34;secretary&#34; (not sure if that is his proper title) would take weeks to respond to my requests. I had to contact them multiple times to finally get a call for my first consultation. I was going nuts contacting anyone I could think of trying to find out why no one has responded to me. So unfortunately his secretary did that multiple times throughout the year. It was as if he either had too much on his plate or he was very unorganized. But it definitely doesn&#39;t make Bojovic look good. So I had to make a complaint on his secretary. Now the guy is way more responsive. So someone lit a fire under his backside.
</p>
<p>
So in total I had two face to face consultations. Two phone (supposed to had been virtual but he always just called because I am guessing he isn&#39;t good with setting up the camera??) Consultations. Three skull simulations redone. As you can tell... I&#39;m a nervous reck and I need to make sure he understands. Honestly, I&#39;d be a nervous reck no matter who I go to. This is my face dang it! But the lack of information online adds to the fear for sure.
</p>
<p>
I was surprised to had gotten my surgery appointment so quickly though. I&#39;m grateful but I&#39;m also like &#34;&#34; ahhh this is approaching so fast!!&#34;&#34; Life is scheduled to change and I dunno what is going to happen.
</p>
<p>
Sending good vibes to you and everyone else who comes across this thread for help. ❤️

Oh yeah, I can echo that regarding his scheduling staff. There seems to be one person who manages scheduling and appointments for him and for lack of a better word he’s flaky. When I want information from him or I want to schedule something I call the plastic surgery at MGH number until I get someone to pick up. I don’t bother to leave voicemails anymore, he rarely gets back to voicemails. Whenever I do get the office staff on the phone, he’s very helpful and I get the answers I need.
</p>
<p>
🚩The other red flag to note is my friend, who had her 3 FFS procedures with Bojovic, had transphobic experiences with the nurse staff. I’m anxious about that happening with the nurses I interact with on surgery day, but thus far I have not experienced any transphobia from the MGH staff I’ve met.

I just had my first discussion with Eric and he seemed really nice. We shared something in common so we seemed to have a good rapport. He answered all my questions but sent me over to the Trans Health Services for an Intake before I can schedule a consult. I will take your criticism under advisement.

What I&#39;ve learned about Mr. Eric is that you have to be on his backside. I message him on the portal only. That way he isn&#39;t the only one who can see my message to Bojovic. Calling and leaving messages gets you nowhere unless you get a different person to answer. And I&#39;ve never had someone pick up the phone.
</p>
<p>
Not sure if the staff told him who made a complaint on him but he always talks to me as if it is the first time he has spoken to me. It&#39;s a Lil strange. But I don&#39;t mind. Just do your job and keep this train rolling and don&#39;t be my road block because I&#39;m just not that patient these days. Only thing I can say positively for him is that he has always been polite.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully he doesn&#39;t give anyone else these delaying issues. Not sure if he realizes how negatively it can impact anyone&#39;s lives.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t been misgendered yet by the staff. That sure would be heart breaking but I do have a &#34;be an asshole to assholes&#34; policy... Soooo .. let&#39;s see.

Ha! Nearly told him off in email that time. But honestly to his credit lately he has been much more on it. At least by my present experience. Hopefully that is true for the rest of us.

I was going to the MGH Trans Clinic in 2019 when I first started my transition. The main physician said that MGH was training up a team for FFS and I was very skeptical. At the time it sounded like they had a reasonable plan—learn from other doctors and practice similar procedures.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I have only one face and am risk adverse. I ended up spending the money to go to Deschamps Braly in SF. The travel and everything makes it more complicated but he’s also done it like over 1,000 times.
</p>
<p>
If you haven’t already, I’d inquire about past experience and training.

Hi! Sorry to dig up an old post, would you be willing to share how far apart the 3 stages of FFS are with him? My consultation isn&#39;t until March 2. Just digging for any info I can find.

Bojovic and Spiegel are two of just a few in MA that my insurance covers too. I’m just starting the process. I am very keen on hearing about your experience.

What insurance do you have if you don&#39;t mind? I have a BCBS PPO but spiegel won&#39;t take my insurance directly and they quoted me for $75,000 for all face surgeries.i really want to go to him but my parents, even though they CAN afford it, refuse to pay that amount even if the insurance company reimburses them.

I have Harvard Pilgrim. Honestly,Spiegel has a horrible reputation. You can find MANY complaints here and a number of places.
</p>
<p>
I have chosen to go with Dr Devin O’Brien-Coon at Brigham &amp; Womens in Boston. This will be completely cover sans co-pay/deductible thankfully, otherwise I don’t think I’d be doing it. Dr Ranganathan was a close runner up in my decision. She is at B&amp;W as well. So far, my experience there has been AMAZING!

Could I please see your before/afters? I’m trying to find someone else to do my surgery in case the Starbucks insurance plan stops paying for FFS with the supp plan.

A lot of new practioners are entering the field.  A flood in fact.  Everyone has to start somewhere.  I’d want to know about who he trained with and specific trans work.

Well not sure how &#34;new&#34; he would be considered. He claims to have been doing it for years.

I’ve been around over twenty years.  He is not someone who is even somewhat well known.  Insurance covering us has created a lot of folks who now are trans specialists.

Not very credible since there’s so few reviews on him. I’d be quite concerned with that statement because it appears to be a lie.

Wow I didn’t realize MassHealth covered this! Out of curiosity why don’t you want Spiegel? The only thing I recall reading about him is that he can be too subtle and you really have to be clear about what you want.

Hi Betty - did you end up getting the FFS with Bojovic? I’m in the process of selecting a surgeon and he’s one of the ones that my insurance covers.
