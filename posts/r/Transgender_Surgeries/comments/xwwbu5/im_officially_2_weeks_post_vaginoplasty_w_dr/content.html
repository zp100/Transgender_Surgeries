Basically what the title says.  I created an alt account for this post, but I really wanted to share my experience with the program at Temple, since it&#39;s still on the new side and there wasn&#39;t much out there about it when I was looking.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;m currently 2 weeks post op and 1 week post discharge.  I feel like first and foremost, I have to say that Dr. Douglass and Dr. Hamidian were absolutely fabulous.  Both of them went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and cared for, not to mention I&#39;m beyond happy with my results.
</p>
<p>
The gender affirming dept at Temple has also been really great.  I appreciated how many queer folks were actually working in the department, which made it feel less sterile and detached.  Of course, their still a new program and Temple certainly isn&#39;t the best hospital system around, but I never experienced poor care, it just felt less polished overall.
</p>
<p>
But, honestly at this point in time I would choose this team again in a heartbeat.
</p>
<p>
Not sure if I got everything, but feel free to ask questions and I&#39;ll do my best to answer them!

Yesss, Temple University patients unite. Iâ€™m about 5 weeks post-op myself and I have nothing but phenomenal things to say about Dr.Douglass, Dr.Hamidian, and Sonya and really the entire team there building the program.  Hope your recovery is going well!

Had SRS there a year ago. Agree with everything you say! Plus no pain, just discomfort from the stitches, etc and rapid recovery.

Hi fellow Temple patient!  Same here, my pain has been super well controlled and I&#39;ve had surprisingly little bruising.

I&#39;m considering them.   Are you able to post pics (or maybe send privately)?   As you know unfortunately there are not a ton of them online :(     I did really like both of them when I met them
