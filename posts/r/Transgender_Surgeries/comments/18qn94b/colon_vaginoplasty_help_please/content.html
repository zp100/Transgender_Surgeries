I have been through the wringer and have had 3 surgeries so far on my vagina.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
was a penile inversion Vaginoplasty with Dr Bowers.
</li>
<li>
was a labiaplasty with her due to complications on external labia.
</li>
<li>
Was supposed to be a vaginal deepening via the robotic assisted davydov/peritoneal flap technique but it has not gained me any depth and has only caused me to have more pain and bleeding when dilating and during sex.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I am strongly considering a revision with the colon vaginoplasty but I am concerned my history has caused me to no longer be a candidate. Anyone know? I would like to check with some doctors in the USA as I do have insurance that would probably cover it. Any suggestions?

Some people tried to dilate for depth,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fyrxcn/dilation_tips_to_maximise_depth/fn58xeb/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/go274u/succesful_attempt_at_gaining_depth/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
was a discussion.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise concerning a revision it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
may be more.

<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/y0krwx/revision_expert/irsk9t5/" rel="nofollow">here

was also a discussion.
