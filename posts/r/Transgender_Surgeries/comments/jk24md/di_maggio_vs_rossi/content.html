I went to Di Maggio, don&#39;t really look any different and he messed up my ears which even after surgery here in Australia to try and fix the damage they still look out of proportion and badly scarred.
</p>
<p>
He also didn&#39;t do some of the things I paid him to do that I specifically said were essential to me, still took the money of course. I&#39;d avoid him like the plague.

He tried to get me to bring most of the money in cash so he could avoid tax and when I said I&#39;d only bring 10k he bumped the price up so he&#39;s not even that cheap. He&#39;s very money focussed and obviously not patient focussed as he didn&#39;t even admit to the errors he made, he did admit he &#34;forgot&#34; to do some of the things I paid for but didn&#39;t refund me.
</p>
<p>
And yeah I have a very noticeable scar that pulls my skin in an unusual way under my jaw where he worked, he&#39;s a butcher.

Sorry, I&#39;m not going to share such revealing personal details. And anyway I&#39;d need to take photos and I can&#39;t bear to look at my ears as they&#39;re so messed up.

I also spoke to the person responsible for DiMaggio even having a career, and for some very good reasons it&#39;s better to go with Rossi.  You will have a much better experience and care.

A lot but not unrecognizable
</p>
<p>
Forehead and nose work were amazing.  Fat transfer to the face should have been more but I cwas hesitant about it and they went conservative.  The chin was conservative too.  Lip lift and scalp advance were fine.
</p>
<p>
They didn&#39;t do much at all with the jaw and I&#39;m having a revision on it.  I&#39;m not sure if he never does jaw work, or aesthetically is against it like when we spoke.  I wish I had clarified what I wanted better in that one aspect m

Did he do your nose? If so, how do you like it?
