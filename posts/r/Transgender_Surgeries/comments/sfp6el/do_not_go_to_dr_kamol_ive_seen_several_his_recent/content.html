Do not go to Dr. Kamol. I’ve seen several his recent works and they look nothing like what he showed on his website. This is mine after 6+ months. It doesn’t look natural. The clitorial hood is so wide that it looks like a penis bending backwards. Not to mention the asymmetrical labia minora.

Damn, Kamol was on my list, not top 3, but still a consideration. I have to say, asaide from clear asymmetry, it doesn&#39;t look as awful, to me.
</p>
<p>
But after reading your comment, I understand why you are unhappy. They didn&#39;t deliver what they promised you, ugh!! Were they at least professional during recovery? Were you well taken cared of?

A friend of mine went there and she has the same result none of us have had the guts to say that doesn&#39;t look right. Kamol is a risk. Sorry

this doesnt look like a vagina. a vaginal opening is enclosed by the labias. it’s more then just “you didnt get what you asked for”

Yes, but most SRS results lack labia minora enclosing the introitus, and furthermore,
<em>
all
</em>
SRS results have differences from natal vulvas and vaginas. It&#39;s disappointing, but it&#39;s something you accept when you get SRS and try to minimize with an educated choice of surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I think the big issue here is Kamol&#39;s track record of sketchy advertising, and in this case, flat out lying to a patient.

yeah, i disagree. i agree most srs results lack a labia minora but most of them do not have the vaginal opening below the vagina.

Before the operation, during the doctor’s appointment that’s too short, I specifically asked dr Kamol to make my clitorial hood pointy and he said yes without hesitation. I also asked him to make my labia minora to encircle the vaginal opening, and he also says yes. None was delivered.
</p>
<p>
My labia minora also doesn’t look like real ones. They are just too flat and clearly looks like penile skin. And they are asymmetrical since day one.
</p>
<p>
Before leaving Thailand they told me it’s still swollen and after a few months it’ll look like something I want, and it will be as pretty as the ones on his website. It’s been 6 months now and don’t tell me it’s still swelling. It’s not.
</p>
<p>
Also please stop telling me vaginas come in all different shapes, because this obviously doesn’t look like a real one. It’s just not as natural as the photos on his website.
</p>
<p>
One other thing. Before I was wheeled into the operating room, I saw a white board in a nearly room. It says my name following with something like “SRS-PPV” and at a certain time. To my surprise, there was another name, also doing PPV, in the same time slot. I don’t think Dr. Kamol can perform two surgeries at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Don’t go to Dr. Kamol. Just don’t.

<p>
The two names on the board…
</p>
<p>
Having worked in an OR I might be able to explain what can happen.
</p>
<p>
At one well known hospital, the main surgeon, (the one you meet, and think is gonna do your surgery)… does part of it. Their residents do the opening, prepping and the closing. And the patients have signed paperwork allowing this. It’s why you gotta read this stuff!
</p>
<p>
So for example let’s say you’re having a foot of your bowel removed…
</p>
<p>
The main surgeon will stop by before anesthesia puts you out.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon leaves the room , and does the same thing in the second room. Maybe a third… then down to get their free breakfast.
</p>
<p>
The first surgery begins with a head resident opening the patient up, getting everything done and checked, and the main surgeon scrubs in. They do the main part of the surgery, or watch as the resident does it.
</p>
<p>
When that’s completed, they scrub out, move to the next OR… rinse and repeat.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile in descending order residents start to leave. So it might be the least experienced one who actually is closing the skin layers, which obviously to us is a big deal. I would imagine to most.
</p>
<p>
It’s not always the surgeon’s fault. Doctors are seen as the cash generators of the hospital and demands placed on them are well, scary.
</p>
<p>
But from being on the other side of this… that may be what you were seeing.

That might explain why they have 14 surgeons on staff.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.kamolhospital.com/en/doctor-team/">https://www.kamolhospital.com/en/doctor-team/
</a>
</p>
<p>
However I think most people going there are expecting Kamol to do the work himself and have results similar to what he advertises.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind saying what country you’re referring to in your OR experience? I can see it happening anywhere if it’s just public health system and you don’t  get a choice with the surgeon, but it’s not ok if you’re paying and expecting the surgeon you paid if for.

<p>
The expectation that Kamol is doing the surgery is where in my opinion this whole thing is dishonest. I think that if Kamol is simply supervising, he needs to say so. If he’s not even in the room… then that needs to be said before someone hands over that much cash.
</p>
<p>
I am a practicing RN in the USA. Not all hospitals function like I’m saying the one I worked at did. It may be standard at what are referred to as “teaching hospitals” but yeah here you’ve settled on the surgeon, not just who was assigned.
</p>
<p>
It’s something to add to the list of questions when you are talking to the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Who is doing my surgery?  Will that surgeon be there the whole time from open to close? Is anyone else doing a portion of my surgery?
</p>
<p>
If anyone else (a resident for example) is doing any part of it (other surgeons do have to learn how to do these surgeries too…
</p>
<p>
will they at any time be functioning independently and not under your direct, line of sight supervision?
</p>
<p>
If so, how many of these procedures have they done?
</p>
<p>
Are they finishing their first surgical residence or are they an experienced surgeon?
</p>
<p>
It may not necessarily be a bad thing If another doctor takes over, I’ve heard several programs are trying to get a surgeon specializing in plastic surgery to do the construction of the new genitalia. Which would not be bad.
</p>
<p>
A resident under the direct supervision isn’t always bad either. The world needs well trained surgeons who can do this procedure. That a new surgeon has chosen to support us by specializing in this area, is a great thing. And that gives motivation for them to do this with giving great results.
</p>
<p>
And even experienced surgeons will travel around to learn other techniques. For example Dr Dugi at OSHU has several presentations on you tube where he states that he even travels to other countries where the surgeries have been done successfully for longer to learn.
</p>
<p>
But it’s not out of bounds to ask, or to get clarification. And it’s certainly up to you if this is the surgeon you’re going to trust.
</p>
<p>
OP shared that Kamol is agreeing to things without intention of following through. Due to that, I wouldn’t trust him to do anything.

Very thought provoking. Thanks for this. My chosen surgery team has a well earned reputation, however I’m copying these questions to ask my surgeon! My biggest fear is that I end up being a practice dummy for some beginner!

Thanks for this It was very very interesting I did suspect Kamal did not do my surgery when I met him for my checkups he looked at me like a stranger like he didn&#39;t even do the work. Any other surgery I&#39;ve had in my English speaking country The surgeon knows you they talk about the details of the surgery with you he did no such thing a very hands of approach which made me very suspicious that he did not do the work.

I had top surgery and when I was asked to sign the paper indicating that I knew he wouldn’t do the whole* surgery, I asked him about it. My surgeon was very clear about what part he does and what part he doesn’t. I feel like that should be just part of the default practice when you are asked to sign that form.

If the first you find out about it is when you&#39;ve paid your money and traveled overseas then you&#39;d be in a very high pressure and coercive situation. Lots of people can&#39;t afford to call it all off at that point. It should be on the website and signed off before paying the deposit.

Whole* surgery, sorry typo
</p>
<p>
And agreed. I think the fact that people can do so much research on procedures and still not realize that this is a regular practice is an indicator as to how much it’s not discussed and the need for it to be very clear
</p>
<p>
It’s something that should be discussed in the first call/meeting, so that way folks aren’t traveling abroad without knowing the entire scope

I really don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on. First of all,his website works are not a good example and look really like need a full revisio mostky.very big erictile tissue,etc. And in the opposite,his real works looking betterthen the website ones.  But he doesn&#39;t hide that he always recommends revisions and it&#39;s not a secret, so he is 2 steps srs surgeon very often...the picture result looks not bad to me

It&#39;s really horrible what you say. But somehow i do believe he can have this attitude same as other Thai surgeons. They often don&#39;t take responsibility for the forgeiners and get them botched as previous surgeon did for me. But you have to be stronger. I earned this f 30000usd and went to bkk during covid, quarantined for 2 weeks and got what i deserve. You have to find maybe some local surgeon (in your country if you come from us). To perfom a great revision for you.i can see its possible in your case!

I agree with you, his bent penises look is weird. Someone I know had SRS with Dr Kamal and her vagina looks like a bent penis I actually showed a photo to hers and said I do not want this! I&#39;m very suspicious that someone else did my surgery because my vagina looks completely different to all the friends that went in fact all our vaginas look completely different like a different surgeon did each one of them feels like a complete gamble going to him. Also I never met him before my surgery there was always some other guy in the room so I don&#39;t know who did my surgery to be honest. I&#39;ve never had a major surgery and not met the surgeon before hand. It&#39;s all very suspicious! I think you will be able to get a revision a friend of mine went to therapong and she looks amazing now she also went to Kamal. They should be upfront and tell you he is not doing the whole surgery if that is the case so you are at least informed.

I&#39;m sorry this happened.. I suggest a revision, I think you&#39;ll be fine after.. you deserve what you asked for. Anyway it&#39;s asymmetrical yes but it doesn&#39;t look like a disaster.
