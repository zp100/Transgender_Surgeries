I briefly spoke about this before. I have a follow up today after my revision surgery that was supposed to deal with excess erectile tissue - but didn’t.
</p>
<p>
If you remove all of it, would stop you from climaxing?

Sexual pleasure and orgasm is a response to nerve stimulation. Most of the nerve endings in the male genitals are in the glans penis, the tip of the penis. The erectile tissue is just wrapped around the shaft of the penis and itself does not have nerve endings.
</p>
<p>
So removing it wouldn&#39;t necessarily hinder your ability to climax,as long as no nerves were damaged.
</p>
<p>
However, some surgeons try to mimic the clitoris as a organ more closely and will use the erectile tissue in the labia majora. In many surgeries in the past the erectile tissue was just removed, because surgeons didn&#39;t know about the analogue erectile tissue of the clitoris.

I have erectile tissue left behind from Theerapong he and Suporn i think only do this. I feel like the erectile tissue contributes to more intense orgasms and sensations plus my labia gets all puffy when im aroused which is a normal response. However if you are experiencing narrowing of the vaginal canal or pain etc. I would get some of it removed if possible.

I didn&#39;t know that , i didnt do much research about Kamol there is so much marketing around his clinic yet quite a lot of girls had issues with their results. Usually good surgeons make a name for them selves without marketing , their patients are their marketing.
</p>
<p>
Apparently kamol lets apprentice surgerons do surgery on girls without their consent.  Plus his results are not anatomically correct the labia minora ends around the urethra leaving the vaginal opening exposed.

Would you mind saying who your original surgeon was, and who did the revision?

I’m trans masc so grain of salt but I highly highly doubt erectile tissue has anything to do with climaxing. AFAB people climax just fine without it

You got erectile tissue to, works pretty much the same as the tissue in AMABs.  But your right, probably won&#39;t change sexual pleasure.

Don&#39;t know if you have seen it ...
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/hpbaxc/questions_about_extra_erectile_tissue/g0hytwk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
was a comment that could help, and there were further comments in the whole
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/hpbaxc/questions_about_extra_erectile_tissue/content.html" rel="nofollow">thread</a>
. And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_erectile_tissue" rel="nofollow">here</a>
might be some additional comments that could help understand a few aspects.
</p>
<p>
So it seems there is no standard, many surgeons have different techniques, some hide scars in folds for example, some not, etc., and it may also depend on the experience of each surgeon. And some surgeons like BBL in NY may use robotic assisted tools.
</p>
<p>
And concerning FTM surgeries
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/index#wiki_transmasculine" rel="nofollow">here</a>
might be some places where it may be possible to discuss surgeries with others.
