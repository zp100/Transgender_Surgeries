I had a vaginoplasty 8 years ago, AMA
</p>
<p>
The main things: - I went to Toby Meltzer in Scottsdale, AZ - Recovery sucked, lotta pain but I was having some unrelated issues that made the whole period mentally taxing. No complications - I got a labiaplasty about 9 months after at Meltzerâ€™s recommendation (he recommends everyone does it). He corrected my urethra slightly (I was pissing left). - Covered by private insurance Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts - I followed the dilation schedule for several years but stopped dilating/getting penetrated for 3 years. Loss of depth but no issues. I since resumed sporadically doing penetration for sex reasons and found depth was surprisingly easy to get back. - I can orgasm from masturbation in 5-15 minutes, this took 2 years before it became an achievable thing. You have to relearn how to masturbate. - I produce enough self lubrication to finger myself without issue if Iâ€™m turned on. Need lube for larger things. - I no longer want to die so I consider this a complete success

Those look like fantastic results! The not wanting to die is absolutely a plus.
</p>
<p>
If I may ask a question, how was hair removal done pre-op? Also did your insurance cover the original and subsequent operations as well?

Electrolysis, about 5 clearings IIRC, lidocaine injection and two technicians
</p>
<p>
I have hair growth on my labia (itâ€™s light and easy to shave). The picture is about 2-3 weeks since I last shaved the area. I initially had some internal growth but that stopped after a few years.
</p>
<p>
Insurance covered FFS, vaginoplasty and labiaplasty.

What really is labiaplasty ? Is it just surgical touching up of your labia ?

Yes, usually reducing the size of the labia but he also corrected the urethra during the surgery

Why do people think Meltzer is the best? I am curious about this. He still uses the pull through method. I know we have several new methods that have been able to achieve less finicky results. (not knocking op, just genuinely curious)

Meltzer was at the top of the game in the early 2000s.  There are many more options these days.

Look the three components of the job: clit, meatus and neovagina, well defined and the clit has the cover as a natural vagina. Unfortunately too expensive, too busy and too far away. Is my humble opinion

What do you think have been the advantages of getting this operation? The last point on the list aside. Like, how good of a thing is it actually? If you could put that in a perspective that is easy to understand I would thank you.
</p>
<p>
Also, what would you say to anyone who wants to do the same? As in, what kind of warning/encouragement do you see fit in words?

These are all out of order and important for us to know. No surgery is perfect, and that is an important thing to know.  To know the inâ€™s and outs of the procedures, be aware that it will not be perfect and you will run into things you wish were diff and not get too hung up on them.  Advocate for the things you wan such as more prominent clitoris or a hood.  Be mindful not everything can or will be achieved based on your materials.  Foreskin is a big plus in a lot of these surgeries as it can create better lips and folds.  i dont know otherâ€™s experience but i found out too late that after GCS you need to see a pelvic floor specialist.  I feel getting the surgery younger rather than waiting is best for optimal outcomes.  You may have numb areas.  I have a few and it brings me down but i have sensation in many.  For me areas are dulled like my urethra.  The area has sensation but it is dulled.   My clitoral hood right above the clit id say like a dime to quarter size of the area is numb from the soldering.  Suporn said i have full sensation but it also can take years for our minds and bodies to meld.  If we are not turned on then it will feel as though there is something wrong or we may panic we have permanent loss of nerves.
