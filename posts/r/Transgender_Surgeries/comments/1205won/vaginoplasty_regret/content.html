I had a penile inversion Vaginoplasty a few years ago and have come to regret it, not because of the decision itself but because of how poor the results are.  At this point, I’m seriously considering nullification, as I have very little sensation and worse aesthetics because of erectile tissue that was missed.
</p>
<p>
I’ve an upcoming appointment to discuss revision surgery and to what extent the situation can be remedied (I know the sensation is irretrievable).  I plan to ask the surgeon if nullification is an option, provided I don’t have other, better options.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had
<em>
very
</em>
little luck in finding any information on people who’ve had nullification following a Vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
If anyone else has been in a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate any info you can provide.
</p>
<p>
Thank you!
</p>
<p>
*The account is brand new because there are people who follow my main account with whom I’d rather not discuss this just now.

I personally would look into a revision versus nulifacation but to each their own I am no one’s gate keeper

To those asking about the Surgeon, it was Schecter, and yes I’d recommend avoiding him.  I had chosen him because a friend of mine had used him and been quite happy.

Ivan Manero at IM Clinic in Barcelona has a reputation for saving the poor results from other surgeons.  Good luck.

To those asking, nullification is generally regarded as being the removal of all genitals, internal and external.  Some people include the removal of nipples in the term, though I love my tits and have no desire to mess with them one way or another.

The one Surgeon that takes on hard cases of disaster poor SRS Surgery is Dr. Kunaporn in Phuket - if the prostate is still there and most surgeons don’t remove it , natural CIS women also have a prostate as per se and this is where the actual orgasm comes from inside , same location male or female - I would be inclined to peruse a serious revision 1 st and get it fixed ! - Kunaporn from what I understand does aesthetics 1 st and 10 days later a full Sigmoid colon and apparently does Jejunum also now - Dr. Littleton in Brazil does Jejunum also and interesting Littletons mentor is actually Dr. Kunaporn and Kunaporn has offered this technique that Littleton does as a 1 st line SRS - I would look into consulting with Kunaporn before nullification and giving up .

Wittenberg has done some lovely revisions. Wont necessarily correct sensation, but its possible. And itll definitely help aesthetics. You have options atm. Nullification removes any future options

I think it&#39;s pretty common to regret the surgery after major complications and dissatisfaction and there shouldn&#39;t be a shame attached to it. Best of luck with whatever you decide. 🍀

Really sorry to hear your results.  I would recommend my surgeon but unfortunately when i told people how good he was very few people believed me.  And he is in Thailand.  I hope you can get a good revision. X

Dr Sanguan Kunaporn.  Phuket Plastic Surgery Institute.  PPSI And he really is... in fact the whole team... is amazing.  I never met anyone unhappy who had been here.  From dental to Lipo to Implants to GRS
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just so sorry to hear how unhappy you are. I really hope you can get a better result.  Btw i went there, c with a friend of mine, because had no option to do GRS here in NZ and Thailand is well known for its skilful and experienced GRS surgeons. And it&#39;s so cheap compared to where I&#39;m from

In no way whatsover. I would think being able to swim in the ocean 16 days post final surgery and having very limited scaring would be all the recommendation needed. I never want to promote anything.  I&#39;m only sharing on this subreddit so that other girls pre GRS can see options. No painkillers needed after surgery also speaks for itself.  I will always be so grateful for the rest of my life for where i went

Had a look at my free posts.. the ones where so many criticised me because i was doing things at 2 weeks post surgery that most did dream of for 2 months.  Nothing to do with me.  It was to do with my surgeon.  But.. most don&#39;t seem to understand my experience.. and all those that had been to this surgeon

How much did it cost you and what insurance they accept? and did you have it done in the states.  I’m looking for a good surgeon and stuff and sounds like I should avoid this one.

Very, very rarely and there’s no clit to speak of.  What sensitive tissue there is can be quite difficult to find and is located to the right of the urethra rather than above it.  My main concern regarding revision surgery is that because the sensitive tissue is completely surrounded by erectile tissue, I’ll likely lose what remaining sensation I have in the removal of that tissue.

I wouldn&#39;t be so pessimistic. Through hanging around Reddit long enough I&#39;ve come to learn that re-construction from some of these unfortunate results isn&#39;t beyond the realms of possibility.
</p>
<p>
Research the hell out of this. Some have already mentioned surgeons known for their good revision work. Best of luck with this, the fact you have managed to orgasm at all would suggest there&#39;s reason for hope.

I’m very sorry to hear this, came thing happen my BFF MTF, she really no feeling after the procedure, so sad.  For me I got the “zero depth” vaginoplasty and I really like it, sensation is good, though no depth, which I’m fine with.

I know that some surgeons use a technique where they make nerves closer to each other when constructing the clitoris to make it more sensitive than the penis was. I know this is not the same, but I&#39;m suggesting that maybe if you talk to a competent surgeon, it could be possible to increase the experience of sensitivity.

Yikes! 😮‍💨
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers was the original surgeon?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m on the waiting list for PPT with Dr. Jun. But honestly, I&#39;m getting more and more anxious about the procedure as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
My wife is supportive but she is even more scared than I am. At least I can keep telling myself I&#39;ve always wanted this and to not give up now, but she&#39;s been happy with my current state for 30 years so there really isn&#39;t much upside for her (except to see me happier).

Dr Kathy Rumer was the original surgeon and Dr Marci Bowers made it worse.
</p>
<p>
It’s why you should research your surgeon very very carefully.

I hadn&#39;t know about the additional issue she had with Bowers.  Makes me glad I decided against revision as Bowers was one of the few who seemed willing to do it (my original surgeons were Brassard and Belanger who refused even my request for a revision consultation.)

They try to preserve as much nerves as possible but it seems like some nerve damage is usually inevitable with this type of surgery.

I just did a quick google search:  gender nullification, also known as male to eunuch or “smoothie” procedures. The procedure includes a complete penectomy, orchiectomy, a reduction of the scrotal sac, and shortening of the urethra. The goal is to leave the area as a smooth unbroken transition from the abdomen to the groin. Although, an inconspicuous midline scar and shortened urethra will still be present.
</p>
<p>
Interesting 😮

Ramenchicka is correct, I’d rather be without genitals at all than what I have now.

Gupta has done a few and recovered some sensation. I actually know a couple of the women personally.

I’d try revision first. Just a personal view but the nullification look to me has little appeal as it just looks like an amputation. Zero depth on the other hand can have a very pretty aesthetic result and if revision does not give you what you want may be zero depth is a better endpoint than nullification.

My prayers are with you. I suggest you take this in little steps...and keep calm. Do you mean that erectile tissue was REMOVED? I&#39;m going to add--for what it&#39;s worth--that Chiro. and Acu MIGHT help restore some sensation. Now, please don&#39;t reject this out of hand. I was suffering from COMPLETE urinary retention (and no sexual function or libido!!) three years ago...and the urologist wanted me in the OR over the next few days...I (being a D.C. myself, and leaning toward &#34;natural means&#34;) told him to hold off...for the time-being. I was back pretty close to normal in a few months...and lately have had FULL urogenital function...and NO PROBLEMS &#34;down-there.&#34; For the record, I&#39;ve been going through feminization (on HRT for more than two years)(and think I&#39;m going to leave the genitals alone). PLEASE take heart...and take your time!!   : )

Concerning a revision it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic
</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time. And in Thailand Theerapong may be an option. In general looking up reviews in the wiki may be advisable.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/y0krwx/revision_expert/irsk9t5/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
was also a discussion.
