...d..does it always look like that?...Tight and neat and not loose and droopy/wrinkly?....
</p>
<p>
If so, is that because of the Orchie? Or is it something else?
</p>
<p>
Asking for a friend with testical/scrotom dysphoria...
</p>
<p>
Edit: Also is there any reduction in scrotal tissue physically as a result? Like does this make it harder to make the Labia Majora if one were to later get further bottom surgery?

Not OP but I’ve had an orchi before. It does look a bit wrinkly but the droopy look goes away pretty quick. That being said, the first pic is stretching the skin, so it won’t look like that while hanging free.
</p>
<p>
Most orchiectomies simply make an incision and suture it without removing scrotal tissue. You can ask for some tissue to be removed, but yes it does make further bottom surgery a little more challenging.

Sorry, it makes bottom surgery more challenging if you ask the tissue to be removed? Or either way?

Only if you ask for the tissue to be removed. A standard orchiectomy shouldn’t be of any concern, as long as the incisions were made along the midline.

International patient for surgeon Dr. C Seipp
</p>
<p>
I had two hospital options iirc, I chose Spire Yale in Wrexham because it was close to the train station and the inn.
</p>
<p>
I cant see any signs of scars, it is healing well.
</p>
<p>
Cost was around 4500gbp.
</p>
<p>
It is probably a lot cheaper in Thailand or Eastern Europe. I picked Seipp to avoid travelling far and he has a lot of transgender patients and performs SRS. I don&#39;t know anything at all about his SRS results, but he understands how to perform orchiectomy with minimal scars and taking good care of the scrotum in case you wish to have further surgery later on. I was worried (perhaps unnecessarily) some unknown urologist without transgender experience might care less about scarring.
</p>
<p>
It was a quick 2 day trip. I stayed one night at the hospital and one night at the hotel before leaving with a flight.
</p>
<p>
All in all I feel a lot less worried about running out of hormones now. At least my testosterone won&#39;t come back.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how much it may or may not atrophy, but at least when I am cold it is fairly smooth and flat since I did not have big ones to begin with, but it&#39;s more loose when I am warm.

thank you for your post!!  I&#39;ve been curious of such a surgery myself; I&#39;m surprised by the speed of the healing (at least external).  if I may ask, how has this been for you? is it any more comfortable for you opposed to previously?
<br>
thank you again for being brave enough to post about such things!

I&#39;ve seen other people post with much slower healing, but I guess I am young, fit and healthy. That or I just picked a very good surgeon. I don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself is not very painful. I can&#39;t say it helped much in regards to a smaller bulge for me since my testicles were already very small, the penis creates the bulge for me which I can only flatten a little bit with low effort. It probably helps more for those with large testicles (or not, they probably have large penises too?).
</p>
<p>
Initially it felt a bit weird to not have testicles, but I got used to it as expected. I am happy I got rid of them, but it&#39;s not a lifechanger of course.
</p>
<p>
I recommend anyone who wants children to spermbank in advance. I don&#39;t dislike children, but I don&#39;t want any of my own so I don&#39;t care. If you are at all on the fence, this is a permanent decision for fertility. At least for someone physically detransitioning it would not be a big deal for someone who doesn&#39;t mind injecting testosterone. Permanent as it is I recommend anyone doing it to be okay with these realities. I had no uncertainties before doing it.

I had 1 letter from my endo stating I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, had been on HRT for 1 year or more, and that she recommended I go through with orchiectomy as part of my transition.
</p>
<p>
For people who are 100% DIY I&#39;m pretty sure 99% of cases you can get away with a fake letter if you are confident and a good liar, they didn&#39;t call her to check or anything so it&#39;s probably just an insurance / lawsuit formality.
