Amazing work. I‚Äôve not often seen labia as well defined as this. I‚Äôm not familiar with this doctor. Are their aesthetic results consistent like this?
</p>
<p>
Edit: actually nm, I searched and the results seem consistent. üòÆ

If I may say

of course, they did an excellent job especially with the labia minora, they look really great!

Wooow it&#39;s one of the best SRS results I&#39;ve seen, your scars are imperceptible, can I ask you a few questions about your experience with the sigmoid colon technique? (I am considering having this technique) please it would be very helpful for me.

Okay, here are my questions: How has your bowel function been since surgery? Have you noticed any changes? If so, for better or for worse? How is your diet since surgery? Can you eat spicy food without any problem? Or do you have to go on a special diet?  How is the vaginal depth? How are vaginal dilations?  How is your vaginal function? How is vaginal lubrication? Do you douche? Is there a smell or problem with your vagina? Do you feel happy for having had this technique?

<p>
How has your bowel function been since surgery?Have you noticed any changes? If so, for better or for worse?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the first month i had 3 bowel movements per day but after the first month my bowel movements returned to once a day at the same time each day which was the case pre surgery as well so im back to normal now.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How is your diet since surgery? Can you eat spicy food without any problem? Or do you have to go on a special diet?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the first month i had to eat a special diet only which my after care team was managing then for another month i had to try to not eat spicy after the second month i was told i can try to eat anything but basically in moderation to test the waters. If i didn&#39;t get upset stomach then i was good to go. After 3 months i was able to eat anything without any issues.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How is the vaginal depth? How are vaginal dilations? How is your vaginal function?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Vaginal depth remains at 8-9inches since day one. Dilations are fine i do it once a week now its just boring. I know some girls say is not necessary to dilate with this technique but i just do it for the peace of mind that everything remains as stretchy and flexible as it is at the entrance.  Vaginal function is great i do have quite some fun with my new parts now without feeling disgusted with my body. I can orgasm both vaginally and clitoraly. When im really turned on my canal seems to relax and i just want to be penetrated which is great and something i always felt but before there was nothing there to penetrate.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How is vaginal lubrication? Do you douche? Is there a smell or problem with your vagina?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Lubrication i would say differs from discharge when i insert something inside of me and im turned on and vagina is relaxed it feels like i produce more Lubrication than i do discharge on the daily. It does depent on hydration levels if im extremely dehydrated ill be wet but need some lube as assistance if im very hydrated i need to put a towel down because im niagara falls lol. Edit for minor details: i always apply a bit of lube to insert something in me regardless of hydration levels but what im saying is if im dehydrated i need to reapply lube if im hydrated i don&#39;t need to reapply since im literally dripping.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t douche now i feel like douching makes me smell bad. At first there is some bad odor especially early in recovery but after a year that is gone now. There is a smell but not a bad smell as the early days , is more of a sweet vagina smell which is welcome i don&#39;t expect my pussy to smell like roses its an organ after all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do you feel happy for having had this technique?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes of course im happy ,if i were to do it again i would choose this technique vs the other ones. I personally believe that this technique gets a lot of bad rep especially from surgeons who know nothing about it and from girls who got penile inversion so they are unfamiliar with it.  It is a major surgery nevertheless so by all means im not saying everyone should go and get this method because everyone is different has different needs and has different risks depending on their health status.

Hi, first beautiful work, thank you for sharing.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m a transmasc autistic partner of someone who had the same procedure on June 15th and currently still needs assistance with douching. I bring up I&#39;m autistic because smells are a big sensory issue for me. I force myself to help whenever it&#39;s my days to do so(she has a couple other partners that help as well) and well my question is with as much detail as you&#39;re comfortable with (could be none, I understand) how long did the discharge smell for and was it a subtle shift in strength? Did you feel like there were defined stages where you noticed a significant shift? I&#39;m trying to mentally set expectations so I can better set my patience.

Thank you for your respond. And in terms of self-lubricating is it  very wet and you don&#39;t need lube for sex at all?

Lubrication depends on how hydrated i am. If im very hydrated i need to use a towel because i get very wet if im dehydrated i get wet but need lube to make things more comfortable. But either way before inserting something in me that is big i always apply lube to be safe on insertion.

Thats what i mean too. When im dehydrated i need to reapply lube but when im hydrated i apply once when i insert something in me but i don&#39;t need to reapply later.

I have a question. I have a skin graft vagina with good depth. How do you think, is it cost to do colon only because of lubrication benefit? Thank you.

Looks great. Minor lighter tone on the outside, but that may just be from a tan. The best is the labia and inside, I had to double check the thread, amazing work.

Yes i was.

<p>
I booked my surgery date for march 2022 in october 2021 the wait times were short but i dont remember how short i just chose that date to have time to plan around the trip since it was during the covid restrictions so i had to prepare a few documents prior to travel.

<p>
About 20k to 25k euros all together including bussiness class flights etc.

<li>
hows sensation in the canal?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sensation is fine i am sensitive for the first few inches but as i go deeper sensation feels like pressure which is exactly how it feels for cis women based on the feedback . I can orgasm vaginally though , the pressure sensation from deeper in the canal adds to the sexual stimulation.

<p>
I eat whatever i want now no problem with digestion or anything. But during the first month i had to be careful what i eat and avoid spicy stuff and anything that could cause constipation like dairy. Diet post colon vaginoplasty depends on the doctor i assume what the tell you but is temporary and once you heal you can eat whatever. I do not notice any ring tbh my canal is quite flexible i haven&#39;t had sex yet but i do have fun on my own regularly and it doesnt seem to be an issue.

Hi! I just wanted to ask, how do you orgasm only from vaginal sex without clitoral stimulation? Is it because of the prostate? And which technique do you use or do you have a specific way of masturbating to reach orgasm only from penetration? Sorry for the private questions üòÖüòÖ answer me if you want and if you feel comfortable of course. I‚Äôm very curious because I want to get the surgery soon but I don‚Äôt know if I want the cavity since they told me the sensation will be more outside and not in the canal, and I don‚Äôt want to dilate for the rest of my life, but if there is hope of sensation and orgasm from the cavity then maybe I want full depth‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do üò≠üò≠

Is just the skin at the entrance. He uses the perineal skin ( skin between testicles and anus ) as a flap for the vaginal entrance.

Hi I have a question concerning dilation, at the beginning did you find it was hard to dilate because it felt very tight? I‚Äôm currently able to get every sized dilator in, but it takes a really long time because it‚Äôs so tight. Does that loosen with time? I‚Äôm 2 months post op
