Hey everyone
</p>
<p>
Day 11 post-op, day 7 of dilation.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really struggling. Not with getting the dilator in but there is some sort of pain on the inside (I think? unless it&#39;s travelling?). I don&#39;t think I had anything like the same level of pain just a few days ago. It&#39;s a hard thing to quantify.
</p>
<p>
It only hurts after the dilator has reached a certain point (approx 2/3rds in). I can get the dilator all the way in (to end dot) but the pain is just so stressful.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m otherwise experiencing very little pain (normally 1 or 2 out of 10), and the pain dilation is immediately (or so) relieved once the dilator is removed. It doesn&#39;t last.
</p>
<p>
Am I causing damage? Should I accept perhaps I&#39;m forcing more depth that I should be?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m quite happy with my depth and don&#39;t want to lose any but I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll give up or something due to the pain. Currently using over the counter painkillers and experimenting with a little bit of cannabis for extra but not even that helps.
</p>
<p>
If this happened to anyone else but it got better after a week or two or three that would be reassuring to hear.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively any practical tips always useful.
</p>
<p>
Thank you xx
</p>

What does your surgeon say?
</p>
<p>
Some people do have a lot of pain. Better painkillers should help. What are you using?

I’ve emailed today but not heard anything back yet.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad to hear it’s not especially unusual. Can’t really have any other pain relief - opiates aren’t good for me.

There may be other painkillers that work. Worth asking.

It&#39;s definitely a question for your surgeon, but I know that the first 10 or so days of dilating were really hard for me. The pain would skyrocket and I&#39;d get worried that I was doing damage, but over time the pain went down and by week 5 or so dilation didn&#39;t hurt at all. Always good to confirm with a doctor, but this sounds pretty normal to me!

I had a similar issue but about half way in, think it was internal swelling, maybe g-spot (prostate) being swollen post op.
</p>
<p>
It was easier if I lay flat on my back rather than at an angle and didn&#39;t push straight through to depth, instead going slow and not forcing it. Also just leaving it in for half hour with a pillow between my legs holding it in, in the end I could leave it there for ages and forget it was there.
</p>
<p>
If you have a smaller dilator maybe use it to maintain depth. You can always increase width later. The first two months I mostly used the small orange soul source and now at 6 months I can start with the green one without issue so really try not to worry about width much, or at all at this point.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations on getting past the worst part, it does get easier every day x

Can you really increase width later? My daughter is still on the P2 orange dilator at 5 months post op. She’s maintained full depth but is afraid she’s lost girth. She wants to try and go up but it’s daunting to say the least.

Should add as well, sorry if TMI but....
</p>
<p>
She needs to play with the thing more than I did in the early stages. I cannot climax because I left it too long / was too painful and scary to touch it. Now my nerves haven&#39;t healed as good as they could have.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I know this sounds wrong especially as it&#39;s your daughter but she should get a small flexible dildo and try to enjoy it a bit after dilating. It has really helped me feel more comfortable with it and the more I do it the easier both dilation and playing are. Something soft with a bulbous tip I find the best to stimulate my g-spot.
</p>
<p>
Again sorry if TMI but wish I knew this.

That’s not TMI, I appreciate any and all feedback.  I’ve checked out dildos, the ones I’ve found seem a little big and scary to me, are their any small ish ones? Closer in size to the P2 dilator?

I started on the small orange as well and stuck with it for the first few months, complications of pain, granulation and dehiscence. When I tried purple one size up it was a lot easier than I expected.
</p>
<p>
I found it easier to warm up with the smaller one for 5 -10 minutes then go up a size for the rest of the time. For me it&#39;s more about getting lube up there as I had straight forward PI and it&#39;s dry as a bone :/
</p>
<p>
Went from purple to blue at about 3 months I think then green at 4 - 5 ish.
</p>
<p>
At 7 months I usually just use blue every day and maybe the big orange one a few times a week. Honestly it is easier than it looks and I think it&#39;s helping loosen the muscles off better and making dilation with the smaller blue one more comfortable.
