It kept me on my toes. I rang my GP when I got the date to try and get a blood test arranged through them. The earliest appointment I could get was two weeks later. The difference is just boggling.

I was there July 1st and left on July 9th, and concur with all of these experiences. I&#39;m making a little documentary of it actually :) Glad it went well and best wishes with further recovery

They seem to have a really healthy pipeline of patients! I was off in room 11 at the end of the corridor on the right as you come in.

Awesome! I was in the room directly straight from when you go up the stairs or if you are coming out of the elevator it was to the right. Sadly can&#39;t remember the name or number of it

Before the surgey I thought it would weird me out. But actually I&#39;m finding it easier to look at than seeing someone elses.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen degloving injuries in the past and seeing those in person was way worse. These pictures look quite clean, healthy and deliberate plus I am not expected to try and stop it getting worse :)
</p>
<p>
If I could actually see facial features I might feel very differently about it. They didn&#39;t take any photos of the rhinoplasty. That might have been strange to see, but I guess I&#39;ll never know.

We had a mini appartment (two bed, two bath, kitchenette, lounge/dinner, balcony), pretty much next door to lidl and a 24h pharmacy (Guadalppin Suites). A villa might have been nicer, but I wanted to be really close to key amenities to keep things simple.
</p>
<p>
I had to make sure we had two bedrooms - as I didn&#39;t know how pleasant things would be. Dealing with my hubby on disturbed sleep for a week, in addition to going through recovery and living on top of each other just wasn&#39;t a prospect I was looking forward to. I love him to bits, but the poor boy doesn&#39;t function well under those conditions.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the endotines. I don&#39;t have numbness, but I do get a weird sensation over that area, when I raise my eyebrows. It tingles or feels like it is spasming or I am scowling.

Could you please change the order of the photos so the surgery photos are last. It’s showing up as a rather gory thumbnail.

Also, you might want to say &#34;last two photos&#34; instead of &#34;first two&#34; to reflect this.

I wonder if Facialteam is doing in person consultations yet. I&#39;ve had VFFS but I&#39;m not sure how accurate it is so I want to get CT scans done.

You said you asked “for the coronal incision to be higher to avoid my centre parting” — what does this mean?

The incision pretty much goes from one ear to the other over the top of your head.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a fringe, I have long hair with a centre parting that pretty much goes to my crown. I was concerned that if they went straight across the top ear to ear, that the scar might be visible going through the parting line in my hair, where the two intersected. I just didn&#39;t want that to even be a possibility, it would have bothered me significantly.
</p>
<p>
My incision is about 1cm behind where my natural parting ends. It&#39;s still healing and if I part my hair specifically over the incision you can see it quite clearly. If I wear my hair up or down my hair doesn&#39;t naturally fall along the line they took for the incision, so the scar may as well not be there. It is very much a out of sight, out of mind kinda deal. My hair dresser is going to be the only person who will notice it.
</p>
<p>
At the moment I am really happy with opting for the coronal approach over a hairline incision (not that the facial team give you the option). If I start getting hair shock loss or permenant hair loss, I will probably feel far less content with the choice....

Not sure why I&#39;m okay showing the world my skull, but think it is a problem to show the cost...So yes, unfortunately I do know the cost:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Forehead reconstruction (coronal approach) 7.200,00 €
</li>
<li>
Hospital fees, Meds + Operating Theatre Reserved &amp; 1 night Private Room + Board 2.650,00 €
</li>
<li>
General Anaesthesia 1.200,00 €
</li>
<li>
Material Costs + pre &amp; post operative CT Scan without contrast 1.600,00 €
</li>
<li>
TOTAL 12.650,00 €
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rhinoplasty was an extra night in hospital, more surgery time etc.. and cost an extra  5.800 €
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t exactly shop around or try and haggle, so you may be able to get a better price.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;d need to factor in accomodation and flights. The recommended accomodation runs over €2000 for the duration and a little more if you are bringing along a support human.  The costs above do include being picked up from the airport and taxi to and from your accomodation (where ever you stay) for hospital appointments. I also had to pay €150 for the blood tests, I couldn&#39;t get done in the UK.

You get the lymphatic massage, the acupuncture, the psychotherapist, the hospital food that is as good or better than a lot of restaurants and the cute branded bags that you are never going to use anywhere and always in the back of your mind, you&#39;re going, this is nice and everything, but I could really have done with a more basic package and saved a little bit...
</p>
<p>
But that is just me perhaps....

I liked the accupucture, my arms and legs went numb, I enjoyed the sensation. If it helped with healing at all or not, I don&#39;t know. Unfortunately the nursing staff came in part way through and decided it was a good time to do obs. which interrupted things, so I don&#39;t think I got the full experience.
</p>
<p>
I got hubby to do the lymphatic massage a couple of times a day during recovery. It was plesant and a great bonding experience, but I&#39;m not sold on its efficacy. But at that point I was willing to try anything to help the healing process happen faster.

Agreed completely. I thought I was done with all this transition (and trans) stuff by 25 and well life happened (kids, married, career etc..) and my dysphoria was pretty much gone at the point.
</p>
<p>
But with lock down and kids leaving home last year, it kinda brought home a few things. I&#39;ve always disliked my voice and my brow. Lock down has given me the opportunity to do something about these things without all the normal social awkwardness associated with transition and limiting how much I make my &#34;transness&#34; obvious to my social circles.
</p>
<p>
Realising that some people don&#39;t even start their transition until they are my age or a lot older kinda put everything in perspective.

I understand! Ok thanks so much. So the coronal, rather than hairline incision, is their standard anyway?

For the facial team yes. It doesn&#39;t seem to be the universal approach. A lot of other surgeons seem to like the hairline approach and try to do a forehard advance (lower you hair line) at the same time. Coronal approach will raise your hairline slightly. Facial team have a video on their yourtube channel about it I believe, or at least a faq. They don&#39;t seem to be fans of the forehead advance and prefer hair transplants if that is desired. But if you have questions about that sort of thing, you are probably better asking them directly through their website or facebook,

Thanks a lot, I have already decided to go with them, it is good to see some positive reviews. Now I just need to save enough. It is quite expensive. What is your thoughts on the FFS Virtual Simulation based on your pictures. Do you feel they are accurate?

Just took a few selfies to check. The forehead they got pretty much spot on and matches the simulation.
</p>
<p>
The nose was a little off (it really is minor looking back at it now). I had actually questioned the nose with Alexandra who does the virtual FFS pictures. She produced some images for me as I wasn&#39;t certain on the shape to go for and one of her noses is pretty much spot on.
</p>
<p>
I will add - if you have a very particular nose shape in mind. Make sure you have a picture of it - explaining things doesn&#39;t seem to be quite enough. You seem to get the default nose, with a minor variation. For me the actual nose shape I wasn&#39;t set on anything, I just didn&#39;t want it to look silly. Getting the divated septum part better resolved on the other hand was fantastic.

Could it be possible that you post the opposite side of the CT scan? I&#39;m curious.
</p>
<p>
Also, why no bonedust around the cut area? There&#39;s literally evidence that it helps in craniofacial surgery to heal the cut and both Keo and Baez use it for that reason.
