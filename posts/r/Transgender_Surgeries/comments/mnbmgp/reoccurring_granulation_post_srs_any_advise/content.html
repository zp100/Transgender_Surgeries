It&#39;s a tough balancing act between dilation and SN. Your basically cauterizing the granulation when you apply the SN. That creates scar tissue which decreases the elasticity of of the area treated. Add that to the extended time between  dilation and it can make a bad situation worse. I learned this the hard way building up a lot of scar tissue which forced me into a smaller and smaller dilator. Eventually it took a vulvectomy to cut out all the tissue and open it up again. In hindsight, my mistake was decreasing the dilation to lesson the pain. I never tried steroid cream so I don&#39;t know how that would have worked. My suggestion is that you maintain or increase the dilation as best you can to avoid losing any girth or depth.

I’m 2 months post op and i have granulation on the entrance of my vagina, i continue to dilate normally its a little painful and bleed at the beginning, do you think that i have to treat with something? I have fear that the granulation continues to grow up and close my canal this can happen??

It&#39;s not the granulation that will close your vagina, it would be the lack of dilation allowing the vulva entrance to decrease in size. Sure you can treat the granulation. but you should check with your surgeon first. The problems arise when you get into a cycle of treating the granulation with silver nitrate and then laying off the dilation due to pain while scar tissue develops and heals. You need to keep dilating if you want to maintain your current dilation gains despite the granulation. Yes, it sucks.

If you want to see what I went through with this granulation issue you can take a look at my documentation.

I don&#39;t have any granulation issues, but I&#39;m still getting things fixed.  You can send me pictures, that&#39;s fine.
