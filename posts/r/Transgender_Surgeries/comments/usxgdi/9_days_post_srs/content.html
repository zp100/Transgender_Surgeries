Hi to all.  I am in the very early recovery period.  I am very happy with surgery, my surgeon , and general experience so far.  My surgeon was Dr. Ramineni and I was operated on and had initial post op care at George Washington Univ. Hospital in Washington DC  I was operated on on a Tuesday, then in hospital and released Friday afternoon.  My catheter and packing were removed the next monday.  I began dilating.  I do 10 to 15 minutes with purple.  Then blue for 30 minutes.  Dilating is not painful, but there is pressure. I had a uti.  Be very sure to rest and push fluids.  My biggest surprise has been how very tired that I am.  I could sleep like a newborn baby right now.  The sleepiness and fatigue re bot good.Bridget

I myself have not gone through SRS but I had the entire Vein from my heart to my legs replaced with an artificial one. I can tell you taking it one step at a time stopping when you feel overly tired and resume later is the best strategy I can think of
