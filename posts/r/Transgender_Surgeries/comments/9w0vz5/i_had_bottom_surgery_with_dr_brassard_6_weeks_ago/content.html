So on October 2nd I had my Gender Reassignment Surgery in Montreal with Dr. Brassard. It was definitely an experience to say the least. I had two very minor complications during my stay, and back at home but at this moment I&#39;ve healed quite well and am healthy. I go back to work in 4 days, I don&#39;t really feel any pain anymore, and the huge majority of swelling is gone. Lastly everything is starting to look normal downstairs, I also can&#39;t explain the level of weight that&#39;s been lifted off of my shoulders.
</p>
<p>
This was an extremely hard experience for me, but I wouldn&#39;t change anything about it.
</p>
<p>
Your all welcome to do an AMA! I&#39;d love to share my experiences for others going to their clinic.

The first day or so I didn&#39;t have much pain as I didn&#39;t feel anything. I had recieved sedatives and an epidural for the surgery, I was technically under regional anesthetics... But they worked very well, I couldn&#39;t feel my hips down for a while lol. From what I remember I woke up a day and a half after and it hit me like a truck, the initial pain was around a 6 on the pain scale. I got some pain meds and it became super manageable. A big part of pain management is just staying on top of it and keeping it at a consistant level around 2/10 of the pain scale. As the days went on the pain got less and less.
</p>
<p>
I was in the care ward area for two days after surgery, then I got transitioned into their care housing connected to the clinic. It&#39;s a much more independent area where you deal with most things yourself. Ofcourse with the help of the nurses if needed. I was there for 6 days, then I flew back home to Vancouver. It was about a 5 or so hour flight.
</p>
<p>
Because I wasn&#39;t able to walk much due at first I didn&#39;t lose too much swelling in the beginning. They took the catheter out and I couldn&#39;t pee. So it got put back in and I went home with one. It got removed 5 days after getting home and I&#39;ve been fine since. My second complication was a minor infection from a slight tear in the stitching. I went to the hospital with the typical feverish symptoms of any infection. Stayed the night, got a crap load of antibiotics. It took a week to go away on the antibiotics and ive been fine ever since. It hasn&#39;t really hurt the anesthetic of it all either.
</p>
<p>
Daily after care at this point is dilating 3 times a day followed by a bath/shower. I&#39;m supposed to douche after every dilation but I only do it after the last dilation of the day.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, it&#39;s nice to finally be past it all!

Slept most of the way as I was still taking pain meds at this point.
</p>
<p>
Before I left for the flight I got the nurse to give me some oxycodene, that help a lot.

Cool! I&#39;ll likely be doing about the same amount of flight time after mine. Really tempted to use about all my airline miles for a lie-flat seat.

Fellow BC gal who&#39;s going into consultation next year. Congrats on what seems to be a successful surgery!

<p>
Would you recommend Dr. Brassard so far?
</p>

<li>
<p>
Was the travel at all inconvenient, and how did you circumvent that issue if it was there?
</p>

<li>
<p>
How bad were costs? What did MSP pay, and what was out-of-pocket?

Yes I would recommend him, he has good bed manners too which is rare in doctors! Lol.
</p>
<p>
Traveling back oddly wasn&#39;t too bad, mind you I popped an oxy before getting on the plane so that helped. I fell asleep for the majority of the way.
</p>
<p>
I paid my airfare, that&#39;s it. So $500. I literally went to Montreal with $200 in my account.

Yeah I was in the same boat. As a 25 year old working a slightly above minimum wage in Vancouver I&#39;m sure you can imagine the budget lol.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, just airfare. Only additional costs were things I bought such as food and supplies.

Yep, gotta love the Canadian public health system.

It has its draw backs, but also major gains.

Well I&#39;m very thankful to have it the way we do in Canada, because if not I would likely not get the surgery until I&#39;m in my 30s.

Aesthetics and depth are good at this point in my recovery. Aesthetically speaking I am 6 weeks post op, but it definitely looks like a vagina. Depth I&#39;m at around 5 or so inches, I have had issues with width, but that&#39;s just my pain threshold with early dilation. It&#39;s easier to gain width then depth anyways.
</p>
<p>
Time in the recovery hospital setting was hell, my body rejects oral pain medications so for the first bit I was puking alot. I eventually got IM pain meds and it did get much better.
</p>
<p>
Once I was transfered into the care housing I was back on oral meds as they don&#39;t provide IMs there. Naturally I was puking alot again and that persisted for days. At one point I didn&#39;t have a proper meal for a number of days as my body would just reject it. I hit an emotional weak point and even asked myself &#34;what the fuck did I do). The last 2 days before I left it got much better, and once I got home my mentality improved immensely. It was hard physically and mentally, but I wouldn&#39;t change it at all.

Hey, congrats on your surgery!! I just had mine October 11th. I’m still having trouble completely controlling my bladder. How long did it take for you to not have to wear giant pads anymore?

That’s sort of where I am at too. About a week ago is when I had my last full on pee but I’m still having trouble holding it in if I’m standing up. I’m glad I’m not alone in this. Thanks!

I had no issue once my catheter was removed the second time so I&#39;m not sure how to answer this. I don&#39;t leak or have any accidents with peeing.

What made you choose Brassard despite the horror stories?

I&#39;m Canadian, it was this or I wait a good 5 - 10 years of saving up for somthing else. I wasn&#39;t going to wait. Besides there really aren&#39;t alot of horror stories about him.

I&#39;m happy that you had a positive experience but I&#39;m sorry that you weren&#39;t more well read. I&#39;m Canadian too, and while the freeness of it is incredibly enticing, his track record is spotty at best. Women coming out incredibly satisfied, like yourself (no proof though - everyone&#39;s &#34;happy&#34; but I&#39;ve yet to see real, photographic evidence of any of his work that isn&#39;t a mangled mess) or absolute horror shows. Nothing in between.
</p>
<p>
Also I heard he makes patients sign an nda to not release pictures? The fuck is up with that, it just seems shady as shit.
</p>
<p>
If you have links or resources to help change my mind, I&#39;m certainly open to the idea.

I&#39;ve seen a number of pics in the threads in this reddit. I don&#39;t think they look mangled. Also I research for months before hand and was well educated on what I was getting myself into.
</p>
<p>
With any surgery the negatives are always more broadcasted than the pros. I did have complications, and a hard recovery at first. But I wouldn&#39;t change it, or my choice to go with Brassard. I also read everything I signed, I didn&#39;t see a Non Disclosure Agreement.

Can you tell me a little bit more about your complications and hard recovery? As hesitant as I am, he&#39;s still in my top 5.

I had to go home with a catheter as I was still too swollen. They had to reinsert it so that was hard mentally and physically.
</p>
<p>
Also after being home, shortly after the catheter was removed I had a slight infection in a tear of the stitching. Went to the hospital and got antibiotics, I&#39;ve been great health wise since.
</p>
<p>
Initial recovery was hard AF as I couldn&#39;t hold anything down due to my oral pain medications intolerance so I was vomiting a lot and couldn&#39;t hold food down for a good 4-5 days.

Did you go for full depth or partial? How does it look now, both medically and aesthetically? What about your activity level?

I know I&#39;m a bit late but can you tell me what his rules for partners are?  I would really like to know what to expect.
