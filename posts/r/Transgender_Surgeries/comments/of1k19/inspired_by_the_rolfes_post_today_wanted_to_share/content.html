Ya, I had Ffs with Rolfes a year ago. Asked for pretty big revisions to everything and he was totally on board. Plus I added fat transfer Edit: I’m a lot happier this time around

I think some people are perfectly happy with him without revisions. I think he will default to being more conservative though. The advice I keep giving to people is to be very very explicit how dramatic of a change you want, tell him you want aggressive. Then maybe it might work out in one round. There is no surgeon fee for revisions but they still charge a facility + anesthesia fee.

A year ago I paid $19,000 for brow, nose, chin/jaw. I just did revisions on everything which was about $2000 and added fat transfer to face/lips/temples for another $6000. Though going by somebody on Facebook he might be a bit more expensive now; but she was seeking revisions for real issues and wasn’t a former patient

Yes that one. No help from insurance. He was far more affordable than the other top tier surgeons though

Omg. Maybe I’ll go to him instead.I’ll setup a consult.

Have been considering Cardenas &amp; FacialTeam and this surgeon seems to have gone under the radar for me in terms of affordable good ffs

We talked about doing it to the temples, I’m not entirely sure if that actually happened. I did cheeks and lips as well.

What is the process for revisions? At one of my follow-ups I said I was unhappy about whatever feature. He stares at you and then provides input, and you put together a revision plan. The care coordinator will send you a quote, and then you work with them to set a date and pay.
</p>
<p>
How did you decide what you wanted changed? I guess I just had a strong idea of what I didn’t like or wanted different. For my nose it had to be revised because there was a bump in it. I felt my chin was still too square, and my brow ridge still too noticeable. I also utilized Virtual FFS to make sure I wasn’t crazy, and to ask him if we could do something that looked like that.
</p>
<p>
How did the doc explain what was possible and what they could do? I’m not sure how to answer this. We talked about it? He pretty much agreed with all of my concerns.

Thank you for the reply. I&#39;m going through all my consultations now and am trying to figure things out myself - so it means a lot.

Did you go with Rolfes originally or just for the revisions?

You look incredible! I remember seeing your first round ffs photos (i think on real self maybe?) and they helped me decide to go with Rolfes (Im the one who made that other Rolfes side profile post today). Wow you really do look amazing. I’m glad to hear Rolfes was so onboard with revisions. I find myself liking that guy more and more.

That’s so comforting to hear. As I continue to heal there are a few question areas that I’m sorta watching to see how they resolve. I get the sense when talking to Rolfes that he’s professionally/personally invested in achieving ideal outcomes for his patients, making sure they’re satisfied etc. Basically he seems to have a really good attitude so it’s nice to have some stories that back that up haha.

Your results look amazing. Do you know if Rolfes also has worked on many black patients as well and does he do craniofacial  and jaw work? Am thinking about consulting with him, but a quick check on realself I didnt see any if at all ethnic patients

I don’t know the racial % or really have a good idea. There’s a girl on the Facebook group named Golly Gi but that’s all I’m really seeing  at a quick glance. I think I’ve seen some other ethnic patients of his on there. Yes, he does full Ffs

How do you feel about your chin tip? I really want to have my chin augmented, but just the very tip, to make it look a liiiil slimmer, just few mm. I barely can find any surgeon who does this (they all just do V-shave) and also ive read a lot about risks of nerve damage because of mental nerve disruption. What is you experience? How does it feel? Any issues with that? (U look fab btw!)

I guess I can’t really picture what you’re going for. But I wouldn’t say my chin is very pointy but rounded. He did shave the projection back and took out two bits on either side to get rid of the squareness

Two words - Holy Shit! You look amazing. Rolfes is an artist and you were his canvas.

Thanks! This is a side view however, and I really do love the profile, but I have had issues with crookedness from the front view (the bone on the right side didn’t stay in place) and some of the cartilage has also gone on that side, so there’s a little bit of a step. Nothing that can’t be fixed, but annoying that it’s happened twice now

Just wanted to share
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/jTGAaDw" rel="nofollow">this

front view showing my nose in case you think it’s helpful. The one side has that nice curve while the other is flat, overall I feel it makes it look crooked

Hey, I hope you are doing great! Do you have an updated front view now a few months post op?
</p>
<p>
Do you think fat transfer made the biggest difference?

is an updated set of pics. I thought the fat transfer made a huge difference, but most of it died so I’m going back for a second round.

I guess for me, I have a good paying job and I generally don&#39;t buy anything for myself other than groceries... Not sure how much advice I can really give. I&#39;ve known a couple of people who have had insurance pay for it with him

Hi! You look amazing! I know it’s almost a year past this post, but I hope you see this. I’m scheduled with Rolfes in May and I’m nervous that I was not specific enough and I’ll get a  result. I basically went into the consultation and said “ I don’t like my chin and browbone” and let him tell me what he thought I needed.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind sharing what you guys talked about between your 1st and 2nd surgery? Your first results were good, but the 2nd are amazing! Thanks for any help/info!

My advice for Rolfes is to be as specific as you can and push for aggressive results, because his default is to be conservative.
</p>
<p>
What did we talk about... where to start?
</p>
<p>
Forehead: wanted to eliminate orbital rim and temporal ridge better. Since hairline incision again required, we reshaped and rounded the hairline to be more feminine.
</p>
<p>
Nose: Fix the huge dip and bump in the middle. Fix the asymmetry due to the right side nasal bone popping out of position. Add material to the tip as it was too pointy. Lower the nostrils, eliminate columellar show, get rid of flared nostrils. Reduced the projection of the nose overall. Ideally, increase breathing ability.
</p>
<p>
Chin/Jaw: Narrow chin as much as possible. I think we removed some more projection. Reduce the jawline a little more. Do the mandibular angle as it seemed to square and boxy.
</p>
<p>
Added fat transfer.
</p>
<p>
Talked about lip lift but he seemed so-so on it since I was really nervous about it. (I brought it up as a potential addition).
</p>
<p>
Good luck to you!

To be honest, I don&#39;t typically see a lot of difference in these types of photos personally – but this... just WOW!  This is truly amazing!  🙂

OP, I am having FFS with Dr. Rolfes in February, would you mind if I sent you a DM with some questions?
