Hello everyone, I’m now 3 days post op from orchi an wanted to share my experiences for the process.
</p>
<p>
Context: I am a mid 20s trans woman living in Indiana for the past 2 years. My PCP is in the IU health system and as such recommended me to Dr. Roth.
</p>
<p>
Referral: Referral was fairly simple due to already being a patient with IU. My PCP put the referral at the end of May in and I got a call to schedule my consult early July. Notably, originally I was required to have all 3 letters of support (2 mental health, 1 PCP) prior to consult.
</p>
<p>
As such, I was scheduled for mid September in order to get my letters finished up.
</p>
<p>
Consultation: Thankfully, due to some cancellations I got offered a consultation in early August without the letter requirement. Thankfully I had all my letters finished by the end of August and submitted.
</p>
<p>
Surgery Scheduling: After submitting all my letters, I was called again to move things up due to cancellations. I was given the opportunity to schedule surgery on October 21st with my pre-op appointment being 2 weeks before then.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op: Pre-op was very simple. I was given an EKG, blood panel, and chest X-ray. Additionally I was given special soap and an incentive spirometer to prepare for the surgery. I was also instructed to brush my teeth 4x a day a few days before surgery. Nothing crazy and it was super simple.
</p>
<p>
Day of: We arrived early and thankfully everything was ahead of schedule. I got to meet with Dr. Roth, the anesthesiologist, and Dr.Roth’s resident. All were great and helped reassure me about the procedure and the process as this was my very first time going under general.
</p>
<p>
Immediately post op: After being woken up my pain was a solid 6-7/10. I said this to the nurse and was immediately provided with duladid which helped bring things down to a 3-4. I was then given Tylenol 2 (acetaminophen + hydrocodone) as well once things started going up once more.
</p>
<p>
I ate and drank just fine with no issues and was discharged about an hour after waking up to go home with my husband.
</p>
<p>
It was about an hour long drive and we drive a fairly sporty car so the ride wasn’t the most comfortable but we made do. I would recommend a donut if you have a post op drive tbh.
</p>
<p>
Recovery: I have been rotating 600mg of Ibuprofen and 500mg of acetaminophen every 3 hours. Additionally the first two nights I used 1 5mg oxycodone during bed time.
</p>
<p>
Since then rotation ibuprofen and acetaminophen has been enough to manage my pain and been fine.
</p>
<p>
Overall experience: IU health, Dr. Roth, the care manager and hospital were all pretty great in my opinion. I had no concerns or comments going into it and am happy that my galls are now gone.
</p>
<p>
However, I would caution anyone seeing Dr.Roth for more than an orchi to do their full research on him. I’m not going to lie, it was very difficult not to punch that man in the face after reading the testimony here and in other forums.
</p>
<p>
However, for an orchi, I had a solid experience and would rate the process 0/2 testosterone tumors.

I had PPT with Dr. Roth on October 7th this year.
</p>
<p>
I find that 99 percent of the things I’ve read online about him were from people who had never even met him or were completely uneducated with unrealistic expectations.
</p>
<p>
I personally love Dr. Roth and I highly recommend him.
</p>
<p>
Glad things went well for you.
