So I was having recovering normal sensation on the whole area, except the comisure and lower labia majora, but, noticed last days, my legs were numb, waking me at nights, and part of anal region. Moved it a little and felt right again, sleep again, no worries, but weird. The panty liner felt like if it was larger than it is.
</p>
<p>
But from yesterday, on labia majora (and now minora) and clitoris, and peritoneum...all are getting numb. Not like loss of sensitivity, just numbness...and it&#39;s uncomfortable when sitting. I think of it as nerve related, but, at 6 months??
</p>
<p>
The part of the clitoris that&#39;s more deep, it&#39;s OK, as recovery let me touch there without fear, but the clitoris itself (visible part) is not feeling normal, and this &#39;&#39;general&#39;&#39; numbness spreading to other zones. Standing or walking feels weird, as part of anal region also feels numb, part of my belly, and this is worrying me.
</p>
<p>
Could be a nerve like, pudendal neuralgia? I&#39;m walking more than before, also sitting again like before surgery, etc. Was feeling alright till today...
<br>
I&#39;ve never had legs &amp; pelvic region in numb state like today, never perianal region, or buttcheeks...or belly (not completely numb, just slightly), and more noticeable today than yesterday. It feels odd.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Surgeon didn&#39;t answered.
</p>
<p>
Another surgeon said it&#39;s due to the stress of my circumstances, nothing to worry, maybe somatization of pandemic stress, panic attacks or waves of anxiety, etc. I believe him because I&#39;m feeling heavily stressful, and he has nothing to lose telling me a truth (the other surgeon never answer questions that could give him a bad reputation).

Emergency medical provider here. Those symptoms should land you in the er if you develop any difficulty urinating or having bladder or bowel incontinence. Not to scare you but numbness on that region can also be development of an issue with your spine. I  can&#39;t and won&#39;t give my actual advice due to the miery pit of medical licensure and malpractice but if you have a history of back issues, trauma, or heavy lifting I would certainly go to er asap if you have any of the aforementioned associated complaints.

Thank you, and no, no history of back issues, heavy lifting and trauma in the back/spine. Only mild scholiosis.
</p>
<p>
No urinating or bowel difficulties.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I don&#39;t feel bowel movements coming, since a week or so. I do them but can&#39;t feel i need to do them. Stool passes with no effort now. Flatulence all day, feels loosy. Bladder feels normal, some urge but almost normal. Bowel worries me, as I can&#39;t feel anymore the normal desire to go. I&#39;ll have MRI lumbosacral and cervical Friday. Blood tests for diabetes on Tuesday. Neuropathy resonates day in my mind now. I pray this is momentary. Can&#39;t think a life living this way from now on.

Something is causing nerve compression.  Six months out I doubt it is your surgery.  If it continues or worsens please see your doctor.

Hi, yes I think about that nerve compression...at least it feels like that.
</p>
<p>
Worried as I live in a little town and doctors like ob/gyn don&#39;t want to even &#39;touch&#39; me...
</p>
<p>
For other complications went to 4 diffferent gynecologists, no one of them put  a speculum inside to see what&#39;s in there (bleeding at 6 months dilating twice a day).
</p>
<p>
I wish it&#39;s no more than stress...I couldn&#39;t make it if this is every month compliction after another. I have no life since 6 months and, while improved a lot, I can&#39;t see the light yet, have no time to do other things...dilating takes too much time still, using 3 dilators and, maybe the larger could be doing some nerve compression (I&#39;ve felt something in my right leg when using it).

Appointments for diabetes lab test on Tuesday,  MRI and a spine traumatologist Friday. People still think I&#39;m being exaggerated. My body feels loisy.  Bowel desire disappearing a week ago. I do bowel movements but by pressure, not &#34;feeling&#34; the need. I am hell truly scared. Bladder seems right yet, some urges but I still feel emptying. My lumbar region feels flat, not lordosis feel like usual. Can&#39;t do diaphragmatic breathing like before when in bed... it&#39;s hard, belly feels weak.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m devastated and doing my best efforts to stay positive, but guys this is truly disruptive in every sense. Will update the initial post later. Thanks for commenting pushing me TO TAKE ACTION.

UPDATE 1
</p>
<p>
This evening the GP asked for blood tests (thiroid, glucemia, vitamin B12, folic acid, etc), and complete urine.
</p>
<p>
He thinks about something with the spine, not related to infection or surgical trauma, but nerve related, and about CES he wasn&#39;t worried. Took a look at my 2021 scholiosis X-Ray and said &#39;&#39;it&#39;s not too much, just 1 year after, so let&#39;s wait for the MRI and blood-urine tests&#39;&#39;.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow evening, MRI for lumbosacral &amp; cervical, then consultartion with spine traumatologist (with a short, yet useful repoort of scans).
</p>
<p>
Complete results of all studies will be ready on Monday, and response from doctors.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having a truly HARD TIME, difficult breathing, insomniac for 5 days in a row, so weak. Playing instruments like guitars feels like worsening. The best activity to make me feel better is play music. I can&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Walking in the sun helps. Doing it more than 30 min is exhausting.  I can&#39;t do much than that. Sitting makes it worse. Laying in bed from sides is too uncomfortable, only facing up and straight. Shoulders and hips feels like dislocated, weak, as the 2 months after SRS (same feeling). The GP said that those postural symptoms and intestinal changes are typical for spine compression and isn&#39;t worried by possible CES.
</p>
<p>
Praying to the Universe to recover my senses and strength on pelvic and shoulders, 18 years of fighting many obstacles to obtain SRS and feel like I could live again, to lost it all in few days. Not worrying only for sexual sensations but for ALL my activities, movements, postures and sleep. I don&#39;t recognize myself anymore, feel disabled as never before and can&#39;t imagine living diminished like this, I won&#39;t.

<p>
UPDATE 2:
</p>
<p>
MRI cervical and lumbosacral yesterday.Neurologist saw the visual report and said an infiltration it&#39;s on the cervical spine, that could be caused by bacterial infection, tumor, causing espondilolisitis, thus affecting diaphragm, bowel/bladder, and sleep functions. A 2nd complete spine MRI with gadolinium should be done to detect what&#39;s causing this.
</p>
<p>
An edema on the lumbar area, but he said that&#39;s not his expertise, he can&#39;t say SRS is the cause of that edema. It is not in the spine, but internal, as I understood. I referred and posted about a &#39;&#39;a bump-like in rectal region after SRS&#39;&#39;. Surgeon dr. Belinky said that edema will reabsorb in 2-3 months no problem. I wasn&#39;t so sure about his sincerity...
</p>
<p>
I have too much struggling to breath all day long, and nights impossible to get a sleep due to my gasp for air. Cervical damage makes dilations a hell, also. Or maybe a pre-condition worsened by the act of dilating. Taking muscle relaxants helps to breath some, and sleep some. I&#39;m in a living hell right now, again.I fear my health collapse soon or late and I don&#39;t want to live this anymore.
</p>
<p>
I fear doctors misdiagnose CES and let time pass enough, letting me with permannent nerve damage.Bowel functions: diarrea or mild diarrea, not feeling desire to make bowel movement. It moves if I do pressure to do it. Sometimes feel the urge of diarrea. Numbness in genitalia is permanent, worsen by walking too much or sitting. Dilating is difficult, pelvic region is weak, can&#39;t accomodate, muscles are not so responding...
</p>
<p>
Next Thursday lab results and consultation with the GP, and  Wednesday videocall with neurologist and the complete MRI report/interpretation. From there, neurologist will ask new MRI or another studies. He was unsure about symptoms and MRI showings.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t sit for more than 1 hour and feel back pain or rigid back, struggling to breath. Friends don&#39;t answer anymore, they think I&#39;m overexagerating, too anxious, etc. Only a couple of them keep responding my messages to talk. I feel so depressed, alone, unhealthy, broken and disappointed. Just wait the neurologist making clear diagnosis. I really am in need of human, and integral help, I really am struggling with physical breathing, and there&#39;s no circle of contention, just 2 friends that sometimes become silent, or say bitter things saying &#39;&#39;it&#39;s all psychological&#39;&#39;.

I don&#39;t have pain, just numbness, but the affected area seems to be the same.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon is 700 kms away and he&#39;s the one who mistreated me bad after surgery...and local doctors have no idea how to deal with trans people...

Update later, when I have a rest. Insomnia every night makes it difficult to organize my activities. I have some news, commented here and in other post reddits. Trying diaphragmatic breathing but turned difficult now due to the spine collapsed posture. Thanks for pushing me to take action. Wait for editing my post later, so many details to tell and organize what I have to tell.

Messaged another surgeon and he discarded a herniated disc or similar, just told me it&#39;s my stressful situation (as I&#39;ve wrote in  my post).
</p>
<p>
One friend who&#39;s physioterapist is on chat now, waiting for her response. I&#39;m truly scared, having to dilate now at night and alone...and going to local Hospital is nightmarish, they think I&#39;m crazy

The first step is diagnosing the problem, and I don’t think you need a surgeon for that.

What kind of test on an ER they do? Here they are very rude and ignorant, i fear going there....
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t sleep since I&#39;ve posted this and friends believe I&#39;m going obsessive. I&#39;ll wake up to walk some minutes to see if my pelvis feels right again. Same feeling i had days after surgery...as if the body is like jelly.

I don’t know, but the problem is not specific to SRS so why would your surgeon be the only person to consult.
</p>
<p>
You are probably all stressed out over it, which doesn’t help.

I asked another SRS surgeon, one that&#39;s cool and friendly, and he said not worry, it&#39;s just anxiety due to surgery, no family, alone, moneyless, jobless, etc. He lives on a big city, so he has different approach than local doctors. Also, he said that i could do mri, ct scans and it&#39;ll show nothing bad, because anxiety can do that symptoms. Said so many people are experimenting all this in South America due to pandemic effect.
</p>
<p>
But, what if this is not caused by all that, and my scholiosys is getting worse? I try to stay calm but 3 days ago I went to hospital for panic symptoms and they treated me coldly. Took by crazy and sent home... So I&#39;m really confused and scared

Regardless of related or not to surgery, it still made my life difficult, can&#39;t sit for much time, being woke at 4am due to a numb leg and groin. Feel weakness in legs while moving as I&#39;ve felt first 2 months after surgery (now mildly). Yes overstressed as being totally alone everyday isn&#39;t good for mental health, then physical. Past week I was regaining musical interests and feeling alive, then this hits. Playing on a chair just make it worse. Standing up, also creates cervical trauma, so I have to avoid guitar playing, computer, and other things.
