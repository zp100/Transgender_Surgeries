I have removed massive amount of personal information, emotional load and so on. It is very had to be objective otherwise.

I have read many many bad reviews of KAMOL which is exactly why I chose to use PAI aesthetic Institute, my expieeance was honestly top notch. Great hotel stay, top notch hospital and service and very humble Dr. Who spoke very good English. I&#39;m very sorry u experienced such incompetence, noone deserves that. I wish u luck in ur future endeavors.

I can&#39;t find a lot of bad reviews about Kamol, did research before I did go there. A lot is removed. I guess it is a chase here and people get influenced to remove or are convinced perhaps,  no idea, but it is strange.

I found them all on Reddit and Susan&#39;s place. Like u a paid out of pocket I wanted the best results I could get. With a vagina that looked Natal which I think I got. But I&#39;m only 32 days post op. My results are posted here , I&#39;ve been doing almost daily post so people can use it as research and to see what to expect while healing post surgery. I&#39;d love it if u sent me a pm. Would love to chat more.

I guess it is not about bad reviews but what the reviews do say. I am as well aware of people having personal vendettas and trashing others, this is why I was trying to be objective as much as I could. I do not want to trash the hospital, just show the real face of it. My operations are so far healing well. (apart of the dermatology mess) So this is all I can say.

It was a disappointment, but I would not say I had as bad experience as my friend had in India. It is a different level here, she was harmed and damaged beyond repair, where here I am still happy with procedures in general (outdated statement - things changed over the time). It just could be better experience in general without all of this mess surrounding the place.

I cannot remember the name, the one run by English Trans Girl. They damaged SRS, I know of other 2 people in the same situation. All not related to each other. Physical damage, like tissue destroyed, punctured colon, and so on.

I can only talk about places where I have been, friend had such trauma after this that she does not want to talk about it at all. I was told too keep away from India no matter what, regardless of what place it is and where it is.

I’ve only heard of Yanhee hospital doing electrolysis in Thailand before.
</p>
<p>
Did you get anaesthetic injections for that?
</p>
<p>
DHT have a good reputation for hair transplants, but there’s not many reviews posted about them.

It is hard to imagine that in entire Thailand there is only one place doing this procedure. The holes on my face and other faces I have seen would indicate that the doctor is not having experience and/or is using wrong equipment. They were removing many hairs at once with clippers, not one by one so it is possible that the holes are just ripped out meat and skin. I had this procedure in NZ before and I did not have such damage to the skin. Irritation was gone after 2 hours. But the person who was doing it was extremally good in it and doing it for years.

I don&#39;t know, I am not going to TH to find out, I have enough of TH for life time. They use an application called GRAB, you would find it with that, but I am not sure if it would work from overseas.

DHT clinic is great, my friend had procedure there too and is as happy as I am. Kamol is doing a lot, they even do thread face lift but I was not that convinced they do it well.
</p>
<p>
Electrolyses were done on other 2 people I know of, immediate post procedure effects as mine, not sure about their recovery. One just left the hospital and the other not sure about. They did not have long enough to have full recovery so it is too early to say how it will go.

The doctor is young, he said he works in there 3 days a week, they have entire level dedicated for dermatology. Machines are on site, I had HIFU and electrolyses done there, my friend who was with me in there did HIFU, she had as well spots on the skin treated. Two other people had electrolysis done. It is possible that this was opened not long ago a (it looks new) and it is possible that this is why there are issues because the doctor does not have experience.

They can sue, not will. I don&#39;t think they can afford to do that in these cases. The trans community is too small and it would greatly harm their business. Its also far from the first complaint and they never did anything before.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also only in Thailand so doesn&#39;t matter unless you&#39;re staying there.

I have removed more identifiable info, as well as picture of CEO and me having a dinner, I guess I should not put it there. In the end it is the truth what I have put down on the paper so to speak. If the hospital is so concerned about negative reviews then there is a way to stop it, just improve the service instead of going to courts. I understand if it is a competition intentionally damaging the name of the institution but if is is from the ex patient then it should not be a problem. All they really need to do is clean this place up, supply necessities, fire up those &#34;agents&#34; who in my opinion are just time wasters causing more issues than profit. Then hire professional reps in their place, I am sure there are many people who would take the job and like to live out there. Then do proper medical consultations and checks before the operations and stop being meat grinder with cut nerves and things like that. It is not really hard to do, proper professional hotel manager, experienced hospital manager and problems would be gone. It is not really so much to ask. I would put this place in order in a month so I do not understand what is the issue here. It is probably more going about money and paying peanuts to the moneys than investing in someone who knows how to keep it in check. Another aspect of this is that proper management would save the costs in total by improved efficiencies and limiting amount of mess-ups which would save the money in general.

If you think they gave the agent in subject a title of Marketing Manager when this person is not capable of doing professional Facebook live session, not presenting herself in professional way at all, treating people like buddies from a pub and doing latrine quality jokes to the customers then it is begging for some explanation. I suspect that the hospital boss is just not aware of this because of the language barrier. But hey, when you have so many complaints then it should ring the bell one day.

This would explain why there is almost no information available about all of those hospitals, I wonder if they can sue in other countries, second thing is that I have so much material including movies from the appointments that they probably would not win, just time waste. If they do have a budget for suing people then it is proving the point here tbh.

Hi, it is past 5 month after srs now, I suggest to focus here. From what I understand Kamol is not doing full PPV but is reusing some of penis tissue inside of the canal. I cannot confirm but from what is looks the Peritoneal tissue is used only as a part of the canal structure and rest of it is reconstructed from existing penile tissue. What does it mean? End of the canal is not healing, it is bleeding and the doctor who checked it recently said there is a lot of hair on the end of canal, some as long as 2cm. I know of one more person who has the same issue. There were as well reports of damage to urinary system and second operation was needed to repair it (not by Kamol obviously). I know of two cases where entire vagina looks like not vagina but deflated penis pulled down between legs and split in half. Quite horrible esthetically to be honest. I know of few cases where each one needed revision because labias were too big or not done properly. I have left erectile tissue just under my clit which is enormous and is causing issues. Lower labias are not connected together and look like two pieces of meat hanging down just at the canal entry. They were supposed to scrap hair follicles from the skin before regrafting it, they did not do it, the result is hair inside the canal and the entry part, same as inner labias. Visually it looks not as bad but it is a problem because hair grows 2-3 cm long, gets pulled inside the canal during dilation and hurts, internal hair is causing localized infection and need for antibiotics all the time. Doctor described the inside bleeding part as &#34;looking like raw meat&#34; so obviously something is not right in there. There is as well one more thing to mention,  Kamol is doing only outer part, there is someone else doing inside job and closing the whole lot and then doing external labias. This person obviously is under qualified or is skipping the corners and causing all the issues I have described. The &#34;bad pussies&#34; as I call them do not look like Kamol&#39;s work, I assume he is not doing it and this is why it looks so bad. So what next? Bleeding inside, it is suggested to be treated with estrogen cream, I don&#39;t know how it will go. The problem with it is the depth, swollen inner tissue, infections, and so on. Hair on the end of the canal, they will try to pull it out and see if it regrows, if so I will need operation to remove entire part of tissue and replace it with God knows what. Outside hair, apparently it can be lasered out with special leaser head for soft tissue. Pain, until inside fixed and hair removed, it is constant inconvenience and dull pain. Erectile tissue under the clit, it gets pumped with a blood and causing uncomfortable spasms on random bases. So the conclusion is that even if the vagina looks more or less good there are &#34;left overs&#34; which should be not there and are causing issues. At this stage I don&#39;t consider sex because of pain, swollen tissue,  hair inside and open wound which is bleeding. All of together is causing smelly discharge, need for use of sanitary pads, discomfort, etc. Now &#34;breasts&#34;, it was to be D cup, 4 months, it is E, huge, uncomfortable, pain under my arm pit is mostly gone but I need a tight bra all the time, otherwise implants do move and lock up so to speak,  this is causing extreme discomfort.  Under the bottom where the cuts were made there is a tissue which looks like a fat band, it is looking like under the breasts you would have protruding secondary fat layer, so the breasts do not look round but like crooked triangle cones. It is 4 months since the op so I hope it will settle,  if not I will need revision.
</p>
<p>
So entire experience is not satisfactory in short. It is half done job, lack of attention to detail and total lack of respect for the patient who will need another set of operations to fix the issues. My rating of Kamol Hospital medical expertise is 6 in 10 based on my own issues and issues reported by other patients. Rating of entire experience is 3 in 10, rating of received advice and communication during appointments is 2 in 10, rating of medical care and quality of post operation care is 5 in 10, rating of recovery in the hotel is 7 in 10.  There were reports of missing items which should be supplied after the operations like proper compression gourmet after lipo, proper post op bras after BA, missing items in dilation pack causing a need for self supply through pharmacies,  frequently reported suffering because pain killers and morphine were replaced with paracetamol,  and so on. I assume this is either staff &#34;saving&#34; on items so it can be on-sold outside of the hospital system or the hospital is saving costs and intentionally not providing all the required services/items where they can. For that my overall rating of the hospital itself is 5 in 10.
</p>
<p>
DHT Clinic which did hair transplants is 9 in 10, only because of extra charge I was hit with after the procedure,  hair growth it fantastic and I am extremely happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Kamols Dermatology Clinic is 1 in 10, waste of time and damage to my face with no visible improvement.
</p>
<p>
This is all from me for now, I will post the update after I get issues fixed and how it was done.

Just an advise, the supplied dilators are horrible. Buy this set, it makes massive difference.

I have advanced to troll class too, the fact of leaving some $90k there is just a privilege and I should be greatful for this amazing opportunity. I bet I am being canceled wherever possible. Darcie was trying to dismiss me here under fake accounts but admin deleted the attacks. She was trying to Facebook me too with dramas and broken heart. I see it in simple way, I pay a lot of money for this, it should be then done up to the standards.  Service should be top class and there should be no issues on site and post operations.  If so it should be fixed and instead of being attacked they should pull me back and fix it . But they are very greedy and this will not happen. So I will have to find another place where they will fix all the issues. Anyway, I just hope that my unfortunate experience will be as a warning to other people.  If I manage to help with all the information and save someone all this pain and problems then it is great.

The fact that hospital is rejecting calls for revision of their own work, that they do not face people,  do smear campaigns on everyone who complaints and the fact that they reps trash people using fake accounts do show how unprofessional this place is. The quality of their work is the same as their approach to their patients. We are cows who will with a bit of luck end up better that the others but if unlucky then will end up damaged. The hospital management is not interested in this, all they see is dollar sign on ones forehead and treat us as cash cows. There is nothing to add here. It is what it is, they have lost me as a customer and I will not use their business anymore,  someone else will get my money next time. It is very short lived business plan but those people do not know what business is. They try their best but are just not capable of reaching better standards. Nothing to add here.

it is the same as my breasts, the cut under my left armpit is too deep and the implant just slides in causing enormous discomfort. the boobs so not look like a boobs, it is poor quality of work, fat transfer was reasonably good but my left side is lower than the right side so I look like having scoliosis. I guess those things are possible and never will be perfect but i think attention to details is replaced with time saving and factory line production method, next in, next in, they do sacrifice the quality with the time saving so this is why there are flows in the final result. I still cannot understand how it is possible to have row meat on the end the canal and hair in there. It does not fit the procedure description and basic principles. It proves untold practice and skipping the corners. I think there is not much to add so I will end here on my comments, I think all of this is picturing quite clear state of things and how it works.

26 Sep 2022 - 7 months post op update on the blog. (scroll down to the bottom of the blog for the last entry).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://kamol-review.blogspot.com/2022/07/kamol-hospital-thailand-review.html" rel="nofollow">https://kamol-review.blogspot.com/2022/07/kamol-hospital-thailand-review.html
</a>
</p>
<p>
(Pictures on the blog)
</p>
<p>
So, I guess it is a time for overall summary of Kamol&#39;s job, it is good solid 7 months after SRS and other operations they did on me, and there is very good final conclusion to all of it.
</p>
<p>
There is raw tissue on the end of the canal and it is not healing. There is a lot of this tissue all over the entire end of the canal.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of hair there, all around the canal. This is actually important because this was to be PPV, there should be no external tissue inside of the canal and there should be no hair in there because even if they used any external tissue then it should be properly scrubbed and all the hair follicles should be removed. By looking at the amount of the hair and its location I would say that they used a lot of external skin inside and they did not treat it at all.
</p>
<p>
What is the problem here? First at all if you understand PPV is based on Davydov procedure where abdominal (peritoneal) lining is used for the creation of the neo-vagina. PPV SRS is using the same technique where the peritoneal tissue is used to create vaginal canal. As per my example it turns out it is not exactly a case when Kamol does PPV. Kamol is using external tissue as it turns out and it goes as deep as 6&#34; inside of the canal. I have checked the paper work with the details of the procedure, they did not specify the type of the procedure and just called it &#34;sex change&#34;, and indicated that the penis tissue was used as deep as 8cm in. (I know of one more person who is having identical issue after Kamol&#39;s PPV SRS, so I am not an exemption here by any means)
</p>
<p>
The hair is all over the canal and I will need another operation to fix it. Perhaps serious work with multiple hair electrolysis procedures or full repair job depending on what they will find once they get to it.
</p>
<p>
So in short this was not PPV I have paid for, they did penile inversion of some sort, some hybrid with small amount of peritoneal tissue perhaps. This was probably to save on time and perhaps costs. I do not know. I have queried the issues of bleeding once, there was no meaningful response, I was told to go to the doctor. They did not do (or even suggest) any online consultation, nor consulted with local doctor, nor asked to come back for a repair. This is as good their post operation care is.
</p>
<p>
I know as well that I am being smeared all over the place by their agent, pictured as an insane unhappy person trying to destroy their reputation for no reasons. They do Facebook movies, interviews and other ADs showing how fantastic the job is, however if you look at it there is no reviews of the operations like months after or even a year or two. All of it is done on fresh before the naïve patients do manage to get any serious look into the results.
</p>
<p>
Another issue inside of the canal is some strange narrowing, it is in two places, one closer to the entry, another one very close to the end. It feels like I would have there small dia rubber bend and once I put a dildo inside it feels extremally uncomfortable. Sort of like a joint jolt you get when you hit your elbow into a corner of the furniture. I am above no 5 dilator and it is not getting any better.
</p>
<p>
So lets go to the outside, the inner labias are not connected on the bottom under the entry, like you would expect. They are separated at the entry and are hanging there like butterfly wings would do. What is this causing, pee all over the bum in short. I cannot pee and have it go to the toilet, it goes all over my legs and ass. I cannot logically explain this. Another problem with this is that during dilation the tissue is being pulled inside of the canal.
</p>
<p>
The entire vaginal entry collapsed in. it is not in line with rest of the body as in normal anatomical setup, it is close to two inches collapsed inside. In short my vaginal entry is 2 inches away from my asshole.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s go to a clit, so I do have a clit! Below the clit is you look at above picture, you will see tissue sticking out, it is erectile tissue they have left behind. It gets pumped with a blood and does all sort of odd feelings, usually very unpleasant ones. Mainly rapid movements.
</p>
<p>
The external look of the vagina is ok in my opinion, I do not mind it. There is as well an issue with famous self lubricating of my vagina. Perhaps Kamol is having different understanding of lubricating, but trust me this, thing is as dry as Utah desert. If I do not apply a lub, I cannot push a thing inside.
</p>
<p>
So, boobs now. They packed me with 625cc full profile implants, the consultations in Kamol are bad, you get nothing in regards to the advise and it just sucks. So you have to trust them on it. So I ended up on FF instead of desired D cup. Once it dropped down it is on E. I have massive issues with this job, I cannot walk without post OP bra (over 6 months now). I have booked a consultation with local plastic surgeon to look at it, I probably will need this corrected. My left armpit (look up in the text) is still not healed, it is better but not perfect. Often I get my arms numb, cannot sleep on my back without bra  support because both implants slide down to my sides and cause pain. Left implant is still causing nerve compression and pain. I do have as well disfiguration on the bottom of my boobs and it makes the entire thing looking disgusting, not like breasts at all. I am not sure if it will improve, this was to be under muscle job, I have some odd feeling that it was more like muscle cut in half and implant sided in between. The implant profile is visible and it should not be a case with under muscle procedure.
</p>
<p>
Boobs are so far apart that it looks comical. I doubt it will improve, looks like I will need this fixed too.
</p>
<p>
Fat transfer, it is the only thing which sort of looks ok, my doctor commented entire thing as &#34;they almost killed you there, you had haemoglobin below 60 or something, this is near death experience...&#34;
</p>
<p>
The hair implants are doing great, but this is because it was done by different clinic and people, nothing to do with Kamol. So if you need the hair transplant, DHT clinic is your destination.
</p>
<p>
So the final conclusion, yeah, need another operation or few more to fix all of it.
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to risk it, good luck in Kamol Hospital. I would not go there again even if they would pay me for it.
