I‚Äôve a few questions.
</p>
<p>
How long post op are you in these photos?
</p>
<p>
How much fat did you have transferred?
</p>
<p>
No implants?
</p>
<p>
How much did it cost, and how long was the wait list?
</p>
<p>
How was the pain?
</p>
<p>
What was the after care like?

- I was 3 months post-op in these pics. Surgery was in March 2023, pics in June 2023.
</p>
<p>
- I don&#39;t know how much fat was transferred in total unfortunately, I didn&#39;t ask and when I wanted to I figured it was too late. The before pics were taken in September 2022, that&#39;s 6 pre-op, and I gained around 10 kilos in that time but I was so dysmorphic about my body that I have no pics of myself at that time, all the fat was going to my belly unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
- Dr Aslani initially wanted to use implants but I decided against it and managed to put on enough weight that he said we would not need it.
</p>
<p>
- The basic surgery BBL with only lipo in belly, flanks and back (thighs if you want) was 9.6k. I did the chin and arms lipo extra, each extra area is 700 euros so it came down to 11k for the surgery. There was virtually no waiting list, they have a lot of patients all the time there and I only waited due to work.
</p>
<p>
- The pain was the worst ever 8/10, like being run over by a truck but all the supplements and research I made paid off and helped a lot in the recovery. BBL recovery is in general a pain in the ass (lol)
</p>
<p>
- The after care from their side was ok.
</p>
<p>
I did some lymphatic massages with their in-house massagist which were fine, mostly in the back nothing in my belly which I found strange. I also used their Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber which was a funny experience but felt nice afterwards. My nurse was a saint and so so attentive, I speak Spanish so that did help a bit in the communication, their english is fine but not enough to have the connection I had.
</p>
<p>
I stayed at the Curvy Marbella. It&#39;s a recovery house but not like the ones in the US, it was just a flat and a nurse would come and check on my scars, clean them and renew the bandages everyday. I believe it&#39;s still worth it to stay there, they also had those leg lymphatic massagers.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
All in all I am happy with the surgery and results, the fact I am trans and have not undergone bottom surgery was never a problem or situation. Their staff is great, Dr Aslani can be a bit dismissive but also sweet (weird guy tbh). I wish he had lipo&#39;ed me even more but saving all the extra fat I have for a second round!

How much did staying at the Curvy Marbella cost? And how long did you stay?
</p>
<p>
Also, how long could you not sit for?

Thank you! That&#39;s very kind. My lack of hips and roundness was always what left me the most dysphoric but he fixed that right up :)

My surgery with him is in a week and I&#39;m a bit nervous about his reputation. I&#39;ve read that he&#39;s rude and dismissive often. Did he listen to your concerns at all? Was there a good chat about goals and results prior to going under for the procedure?

He was not rude or dismissive to me at all. I was originally planned to do a Supercharged BBL with him with implants but when he saw me and touched my fat, he dropped the implants and did only fat grafting (which surprised me). He knows what he&#39;s doing, and he can get you looking great but there&#39;s a very small probability, like in any surgery, that something can go wrong.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
You won&#39;t get a long chat as he&#39;s a busy guy so just be ready with a few questions that you have for him and don&#39;t be shy! You&#39;ll look great

what happened? did you get any response or compensation?  Also, is there any chance to find out his insurance company and information about any medical negligence claims? He was struck off as a GP in UK so wonder if that&#39;s why he is in Spain now?

Wow, your pre-op body is just like mine too! Is this the typical result of BBLs? I might have to go get one then! I really like this result! My only dysphoria left (and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s countable as gender dysphoria or just plain old body dysphoria that any other woman feels) but I feel like I look ridiculous in pants because I have too much belly and love handles and not enough hips. Most pants don&#39;t even fit right because they all the &#34;high waisted&#34; pants fit on the largest part of my belly! I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because my belly fat isn&#39;t lower down or what, like, if even my belly fat is still in the androgynous pattern instead of gynoid belly fat that sits lower.

It&#39;s this very annoying almost cis body but more on the androgynous üòÖ this is the usual result of BBLs yeah! They took all the fat I had on my muffin top, back and arms and put it on the butt giving the nice hourglass shape and illusion of smaller waist with the big hips. It&#39;s fab and I totally recommend if you have my body type

There‚Äôs whole instagrams dedicated to his botched cases, if you go in the wiki here it‚Äôs mostly just botches. So he does have a bad rep, but when his results are good, they are life changing
