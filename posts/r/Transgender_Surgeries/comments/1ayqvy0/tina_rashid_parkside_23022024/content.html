Day 2: 24/02 - 2pm
</p>
<p>
Urethra was damaged a bit by the catheter and caused a bit too much bleeding for the nurse&#39;s liking so I&#39;ve had pressure dressing applied again. Moderate pain, manageable but I do miss the morphine lol. Paracetamol just does not cut it. Time for a snooze.
</p>
<p>
Day 2: 24/02 - 7pm
</p>
<p>
Pain is pretty bad. Managed to nag the nurses enough for another shot of morphine but it hasn&#39;t helped at all. I wanted sleeping meds... Cannot get any sleep with this pain. Having my pressure dressing removed so soon and standing up has caused all of this. Thanks Bellringer. I&#39;ve gotten ~6 hours of sleep since I was admitted 2 days ago. So exhausted.
</p>
<p>
Day 2: 24/02 - 9pm
</p>
<p>
Pain is unbearable. So much pressure. I have not opened my bowels since the enema before surgery. I am beyond tired but cannot sleep due to the pain. I have been crying for most of the last hour due to pain and lack of sleep. Luckily the night nurse is going to give me a sleeping med so I can at least get some rest. Hopefully tomorrow is better. Today just got worse and worse...
</p>
<p>
Day 2: 24/02 - 11:30pm
</p>
<p>
Sleeping med did nothing, still wide awake despite being completely exhausted. Still in great pain and I&#39;ve emotionally reached the end of my rope. Nurses won&#39;t help me any more. They say I could still have drug in me from surgery that is keeping me awake unable to sleep. Fed up. I don&#39;t regret anything but wow this is sucking and it hurts and I&#39;m not getting the help I need. Besides the surgery which doesn&#39;t count of course, I&#39;ve had ~7 hours sleep in the last 94.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 2:30am
</p>
<p>
I am staring at my wall, trying to fall asleep. I feel sudden wetness. I am bleeding quite a lot. Have called the nurse, she went to get help. Please I just want one night of sleep. Its been months since I slept properly. Second nurse comes to help clean me, identify the source of the bleeding (surprise, its the urethra, thanks Bellringer) and change my pressure dressing. All I want is sleep. I&#39;m an exhausted wreck at this point.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 5am
</p>
<p>
Once again covered in blood. The bleeding will not stop. Waiting for the nurses to yet again redo my pressure dressing. I&#39;m so, so, so, so tired. I have paracetamol via IV. I&#39;m told Miss Rashid will be in today to look at me. Hopefully she has solution. I&#39;m drained, entirely. Still no sleep.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 8am
</p>
<p>
The latest pressure dressing is apparently tight enough to stop the bleeding. Still very much in pain. Refused breakfast. I am incredibly bloated - have not emptied my bowels since Thursday. I need some stronger laxatives... Given up on asking for pain relief, I don&#39;t believe anyone cares at this point.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 11:30am
</p>
<p>
Not much change. Still in great pain, still can&#39;t sleep, still can&#39;t empty bowels. Had a crying session when the nurses came to change my bed sheets because standing up was so painful and distressing.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 3pm
</p>
<p>
Praise prune juice! Omg finally, after 4 days I manage to open my bowels and the relief cannot be understated. Most of my pain and discomfort was due to being so clogged up. An hour after unclogging I am able to be mobile, I take a walk around the hospital and just generally feel so much better.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 6pm
</p>
<p>
Had my mother help me wash my hair and stay refreshed, things are looking much better now. Pain is manageable, mood is improving greatly. Will get my pressure dressing removed again tomorrow, should be fine as the bleeding seems to have mostly stopped. Got some flowers from the chef, he&#39;s lovely and has really helped me feel better.
</p>
<p>
Day 3: 25/02 - 10pm
</p>
<p>
Mostly uneventful, took a trip to the vending machine as I&#39;ve been quite mobile this evening. Watched Hairspray on the TV and just been given my nightly meds which included a sleeping pill. Good night!
</p>
<p>
Day 4: 26/02 - 8am
</p>
<p>
Not a solid night&#39;s sleep but the most amount of sleep I&#39;ve gotten since the op. Feeling a bit more refreshed. Had Dana come and rip off my pressure dressing while saying sorry in a very routine way. I swear these nurses are sadists! Its looking okay, am told to monitor the bleeding and hopefully I don&#39;t have to go back to the pressure dressing. I&#39;ve been told not to overdo it with mobilisation. Pain has mostly reduced to a dull ache, is not too bad right now. Next few days will hopefully be boring, Wednesday is packing removal.
</p>
<p>
Day 4: 26/02 - 3pm
</p>
<p>
Mother and sister have now left, I&#39;ll be alone for the rest of the week. Was very mobile today and did a whole lap around the hospital outside, fresh air was lovely. Got steak for dinner, going to try and nap until then. Small amounts of bleeding and discharge but nothing that raises any alarms. Managed to open my bowels again today, was a great relief. Got me some prune juice to go with my steak. P.S. if any other girls currently at parkside see this and want to hang out, I&#39;m in room 215 x
</p>
<p>
Day 4: 26/02 - 6pm
</p>
<p>
Managed to have a good nap. The steak was delicious. Do recommend. Pain is at a fine level. Feeling a lot more positive now. I coughed lightly and that hurt like a bitch, do not recommend that. Have to be careful and try to avoid a prolapse. Going to rest for the remainder of the night after freshening up a bit, think I might take a walk to the vending machine before that though.
</p>
<p>
Day 4: 26/02 - 7:30pm
</p>
<p>
Had my first blood thinner injection in thigh to prevent clots. Would have had them sooner if it weren&#39;t for the bleeding issues a few days ago. Third bowel movement since the surgery. Any relief of pressure is very very welcome. Prune juice is amazing.
</p>
<p>
Day 4: 26/02 - 11pm
</p>
<p>
Mostly unremarkable, bleeding is still minimal, I managed to open my bowels again. Pain is dull and achey, swelling is increasing slightly. Spent most of the evening watching tv. I have been taking pictures, and I will upload them all on the final day in hospital. Beyond that I will likely do monthly updates for a few months.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: 27/02 - 9am
</p>
<p>
Sleep was okay, not great. Pain flares up sometimes, the tightness is unreal. Bleeding is still fine. Trying to be active - I rearranged the flowers in my room and managed to change my PJ&#39;s by myself along with cloth washing, energy and mood are generally increasing. Had lovely English breakfast, going to have a nap as I am feeling a bit drained after a somewhat mobile and active morning.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: 27/02 - 3pm
</p>
<p>
Been resting for a lot of the day. Saw Tina, she had a look and was happy that everything is healing perfectly. Went for a nice lap around the outside the hospital. Swelling is a bitch! Bowel movements are getting more common and easier, which is really appreciated. Catheter and packing are to be removed tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Day 5: 27/02 - 6pm
</p>
<p>
Had another blood thinner and another lovely steak. Managed to find a comfy side sleeping position using my blahaj, definitely recommend to bring a body pillow of some sort! Pain is low to moderate. Sometimes I get very sharp flashes which I&#39;m assuming is the nerves doing their thing. Can&#39;t wait to be free of catheter and packing. Oh and bring your own pillowcases, the ones they have here are sorta awful.

When I had my pressure dressing removed I asked to have the catheter taped to my tummy to prevent it tugging at my urethra. Once your all healed perhaps that could help you
</p>
<p>
I hope your recovery goes well!

It&#39;s been taped there the whole time! It was standing up for the first time that caused the bleeding to start. All good though. Just wish I had more pain relief...

So sorry to hear of your horrible night.  I know exactly how you feel with the bloating and bowels - I found it VERY uncomfortable those first few days, felt like things were never going to work again. Then suddenly, they did. I know it&#39;s uncomfortable and painful, but walking around is good, even if it&#39;s just a few laps round your room then back on the bed, a few times a day - it definitely helped me to get things moving. Sending comforting hugs xx

Thank you. Needed to hear this. I do have my mother here now, she is helping me move around the room a bit. And the nurses gave me some prune juice. Hope it&#39;ll kickstart things

Prune juice is quite effective as far as I know. I assume they&#39;re giving you Senakot &amp; Lactulose? They work well - the Lactulose can cause a lot of wind, which certainly doesn&#39;t help the bloating, but you definitley want things soft right now. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got your Mom there to give you some support. Fear not, things will start moving, just remember not to strain :-). More hugs x

The prune juice did the trick! I have been very gassy over the last few days due to the lactulose yeah. Wasn&#39;t exactly fun. But finally got that relief and now I&#39;m not begging for painkillers and sleeping meds every half hour. Hoping tonight I will actually get a good sleep.

That&#39;s great - so happy for you - it is a huge relief! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll sleep better tonight. I only got two decent nights while in hospital, and one of them was after asking for something to make me sleep. Sweet dreams.

I haven&#39;t had SRS yet, but I did have an FDL 360 tummy tuck last year after losing a lot of weight as a part of my transition...
</p>
<p>
I feel your pain so much, even though its absolutely worth it, surgery is still surgery and recovery is not to be underestimated.
</p>
<p>
When I was discharged from hospital it took two nurses to carry me out, I was in more pain than I thought possible. I was bed bound for a week, took two weeks before I could even start to stand up straight. I cried so much. It took me like, 4 days before I could pass stools. Everytime I did for the next two weeks was a terrifying ordeal as I tried to pass things as best as I could while dealing with all the abdominal pain. I&#39;d recommend a fibre supplement like metamucil to help avoid straining.
</p>
<p>
I remember maybe 8 days after the operation, I sneezed... such a simple thing, but it was horrific. The pain I felt after soing so was unreal, I was sure I&#39;d popped some internal stitches and called the hospital in a panic.
</p>
<p>
Now though, it was the best thing I&#39;ve done. I&#39;m so much happier and more confident with my body, and it was worth all of that. Recovery sucks, what you&#39;re going through right now is the roughest part of the whole process, but you&#39;re strong, and you&#39;ll get through it. ❤️

Yeah this was my first ever time under general anaesthesia, first time with morphine too - it sure did a number on me! Hopefully I think I am through the worst of it now, at least until I sneeze! Oh god I&#39;m not looking forward to that aha.

Day 5: 27/02 - 9pm
</p>
<p>
Pain flaring up at times, but generally is manageable. I much prefer to be standing up when I have the energy to do so as it is less pressure on everything. Night nurse has informed me that my catheter will be removed at 6am tomorrow, with my packing to be removed at 9am or so. Quite looking forward to those, not so looking forward to dilation but we&#39;ll manage, we have to! Really looking forward to being able to shower again. Tomorrow is my last full day here. I&#39;m gonna miss it, in a strange way. Has been like a dream world.
</p>
<p>
Day 6: 28/02 - 6am
</p>
<p>
Nurse came and removed my catheter, it was an extremely unpleasant experience. Does feel nice to be free of it though, hopefully I can successfully pass urine three times so I don&#39;t have to have it back in. Eggs Benedict for breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Day 6: 28/02 - 9am
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve managed to pass urine and empty my bladder enough, yay. It was a very weird experience and I didn&#39;t even notice when it started to come out. Since then I have had the packing removed, it SUCKED. Even more unpleasant than the catheter. I have dilated for the first time, the medium size was too much for me, but I got just over 5 inches with the small one. It is uncomfy at best, but not painful.
</p>
<p>
Day 6: 28/02 - 12pm
</p>
<p>
Had the most emotional shower of my life. I laughed, I cried, it felt super amazing to get fully clean again after this very intense week. Went for a lap around the hospital and waddled way less this time. Ordered the last of my meals as I&#39;m going home tomorrow morning. Having one last steak! The new bits are feeling so much better and the pain has mostly gone now that I&#39;m free of the catheter and packing. Sitting is of course going to be awkward and uncomfortable for a long while yet, but hopefully it&#39;s only upwards from here. I did notice what seems to be a small bit of dehiscence at the bottom of the vaginal opening, but nothing to worry about!
</p>
<p>
Day 6: 28/02 - 6pm
</p>
<p>
Did my second dilation session at 4pm, it was unpleasant but manageable, distracted myself with some Futurama. Takes so much time in total though - to prepare and set things up, to get to depth and then to clean up properly afterwards and the douching too... Gonna take nearly 4 hours out of my day for the first few months! Almost got the green flag for my bladder scans, and nurse has informed me that I will not be needing another catheter, so that&#39;s a huge relief.
</p>
<p>
Day 6: 28/02 - 7pm
</p>
<p>
Completely emptied my bladder, saw Tina for the last time and was told that I&#39;d have follow-up in 10 weeks. Feeling quite good besides the fact I am getting a fever and I can&#39;t hold my urine for more than a few seconds. So for now it seems I am stress incontinent. But here&#39;s hoping I get the control in those muscles back soon.
</p>
<p>
Day 6: 28/02 - 11pm
</p>
<p>
Got some more antibiotics for the infection, my last set of painkillers and its time to do my third dilation. Really not looking forward to it but it has to be done. Good night. Tomorrow morning I get discharged, and I will stop posting updates in here. I may make update posts at various milestones in the future. Thank you for reading, this journal has helped keep me sane and I hope all of this has proven helpful for somebody.
</p>
<p>
Day 7: 29/02 - 9am
</p>
<p>
Well that&#39;s it then, I&#39;ve had my breakfast and its time to dilate and then get ready to leave. I&#39;ll put together a photo album of my week here in the next few days. For anyone considering this surgery - it sucks, it really really does. There is a lot of pain and discomfort, many emotions and depressing things about it all. Would I go back if I could? Hell no. This is right for me, and I&#39;m in love with my new bits, but know that it really is not easy. There&#39;s not much that can really prepare you for this though, so make sure you have a good support network of friends and family, I certainly know I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do this alone.

Awesome, congratulations. Looking gorgeous :-). I&#39;m 7 weeks post, also with Tina Rashid. That feeling of waking up in recovery, knowing it&#39;s not there anymore - absolutely amazing. Hope your recovery goes well x

Thank you! I know right? The feeling of relief is so immense. I&#39;m in love with my new bits already. Can&#39;t wait to go swimming in a few months!

Omg I’m having mine made in April. Praying I get more sleep than this I love my sleep. Anything you wish you had in the hospital that you didn’t take with you?

Good luck! I massively over prepared so there&#39;s nothing that I missed, they will give you a list of things to bring which covers most that you&#39;ll need. Some extras that can be super helpful - a small mirror that stands on its own, snacks, menuka honey although you won&#39;t need that for a while.  Recommend waxing legs before (but not the surgery area) so less to worry about. Small laptop filled with movies is helping keep me sane along with my crochet bag. Some nice slippers that you can walk in, to help when you can mobilise (you&#39;ll want to after being stuck in bed for a while). If I can think of more I&#39;ll let you know!

Thank you. I’m both scared and excited 😂. Sounds like you’re having a right time of it hope things get better for you real soon. I just made a note in my Surgery notes. Do not let them remove the pressure dressing too soon.🤣😂
</p>
<p>
What’s the honey for?

The honey is very good for speeding up healing of dehiscence and granulation. And yeah lol hopefully I am getting the pressure dressing removed tomorrow morning.
</p>
<p>
It is amazing how much better I am feeling after a hugely explosive episode on the toilet :&#39;) as much as I was in pain for the first day, I would recommend not to over do it with the morphine. Although I suspect it wasn&#39;t just morphine that caused my constipation issues.
</p>

Oh and obviously you&#39;re going to want a doughnut cushion and a bunch of fresh PJ&#39;s (have a look around on vinted for some cheap and new cotton PJ sets) you won&#39;t need underwear while in hospital but afterwards you&#39;ll want some disposables like pull-ups, or a bunch of super cheap cotton panties that you don&#39;t care about ruining with blood.

I&#39;ve got a bit from my mum but am saving that for when I get discharged as I shouldn&#39;t be mixing that with the other meds they are giving to me (it also has paracetamol in it so that makes it harder as I&#39;m getting paracetamol from the nurses every 6-8 hours or so.
