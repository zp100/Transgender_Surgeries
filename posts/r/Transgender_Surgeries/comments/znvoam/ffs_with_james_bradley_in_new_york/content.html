Hey all! I got FFS with James Bradley in New York a year and a half ago. My experience was very mediocre and I don&#39;t recommend him. Unfortunately I&#39;m not willing to post pictures, so you&#39;ll just have to read my account and make your own judgments. Thoughts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
My jaw work is not &#34;clean&#34;. There&#39;s a large notch in the bone in a section that should obviously be flat on one side of my jaw. It&#39;s not visible when looking at my face, but you can feel it easily (the notch is wider than my index finger) and that seems shoddy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He aggressively eliminated the angle in my jaw when I specifically asked him not to do that.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The transition he created between my chin and jaw is pretty unnatural, and makes me look a bit &#34;jowly&#34;. It&#39;s unpleasant and surely was avoidable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My forehead is not flat, at all. It&#39;s easily visible as shadows in any picture of me where the light source is coming from an angle rather than pointing directly at my face. This is particularly in the area between and immediately above my eyes, and as you run your finger along my eyebrows. The bone under one eyebrow is relatively flat, and the other has a very noticeable incline in the underlying bone. This is visible when you look at my face.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;ve come to terms with my results, and they did have the effect of stopping me from getting clocked anymore, and I do get positive feedback about my appearance from partners. However, I don&#39;t recommend that others go to this surgeon if they can avoid it.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE January 27, 2023: &#34;My forehead is not flat&#34; has now escalated to &#34;this actually needs to get checked out by someone because I&#39;m concerned that there are holes in the bone or something.&#34; I&#39;ve gotten a referral to visit a different regional surgeon and get it checked out. I&#39;m hoping they do a CT scan and look at the bone and can conclude either &#34;yes there are holes in your skull&#34; or &#34;no there are not holes in your skull.&#34; If there&#39;s no holes in my skull then I think can continue to make peace with it as it is now. If there are holes then I may be faced with a tough choice about whether to just patch the holes, or get my forehead redone. No idea, but I&#39;ll continue to update here as long as that doesn&#39;t violate any subreddit rules.

Hi,
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for this. Glad to hear youâ€™ve come to terms with it. Iâ€™m about to start the process of trying to get insurance approval for Bradley. Would you mind tell me what made you choose him?
</p>
<p>
Also, did he use those surgery cutting guides created from the CT scans?
</p>
<p>
Have you taken your concerns to him? Any response?
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much.

You&#39;re welcome!
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if he used the cutting guides from the CT scan. He did say that he had made cutting guides from the CT scan, but I don&#39;t know if he used them.
</p>
<p>
I chose him because he had a very short waiting list (less than three months from first contact to surgery), and I had quit my job to get on Medicaid to get free FFS -- so I wanted to be unemployed for as short a time as possible. I realize now that I could have done this differently with better planning, and gone to a more reputable surgeon but still used Medicaid.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not taken my concerns to him and don&#39;t have any interest in that. I don&#39;t live in New York anymore and I&#39;ve chosen to integrate this experience into my life and move on.
</p>
<p>
ETA: I also chose him because I didn&#39;t see anything bad about him on this sub, which is why I wanted to post this.

Thanks for responding. Itâ€™s super helpful. Did he do rhinoplasty also?

Yep! And my rhino was fine so I didn&#39;t share about it. Minor changes. Oh wait actually that&#39;s not true, the visual results are fine but the divider inside my nostrils is bent much further into one nostril than the other now, and so one nostril is much better at breathing than the other.
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t visually apparent though and frankly it hardly ever bothers me or is even noticeable so I forgot to mention it. Though the amount that the divider bends into my one nostril is significant.

i have a very similar result with dr Bradley uneven lumpy mandible with octagon like appearance, told him to keep my angles sharp and narrow the chin area but its like he did opposite of what i asked for. my jaw angles are gone and narrow but my chin is wide also my nose is leaning to the right and i have a scooped out left nostril with breathing issues. My forehead is fine although its still square and my brow were not raised as mush as i would have liked them to be. also surgeons doing practical&#39;s during my procedure which i did not give consent for or was informed about. very unhappy my life is ruined

If so, its a different surgeon who happens to have the same name.

Tell me about it I can tell what you mean by the jaw itâ€™s like itâ€™s missing small pieces of bone when touched, for me I had ig a normal fem hairline to eyebrows ratio ( just ur forehead size ) and he completely brought it down like 2 inches when all I asked was it for it to be rounder. now I have like a 3 and a half inch forehead and low key feeling regret when mentioning lowering it at all, and yea my forehead isnâ€™t completely flat either but hey I wish I woulda seen this b4 the surg
