The incisions finally closed up ü•µ. I couldn&#39;t be more relieved. See previous posts for details. It&#39;s so nice to just be able to pee and not have to mess with all the aquacel every single time. You can still definitely feel the scars, but between massaging them and silicone gel I&#39;m not really worried about them long term. The incisions in my belly button and side have dissipated quite a bit already. I&#39;m putting silicone on all of them twice a day.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still sleeping quite a bit, like nine to ten hours and occasional naps, when I would normally sleep seven and never nap. There&#39;s still swelling that I expect will take some time to go down. I&#39;m not really worried about the slight angle until that happens. Bluebond brought up independently that I was totally centered in the OR. I don&#39;t really notice unless I&#39;m looking very critically at photos like this.
</p>
<p>
I had originally planned on taking off six weeks total, but with the extra healing I got to do they extended my leave to twelve just in case. At one of my follow ups the nurse indicated I should normalize being out for the full twelve weeks in my head, which she said was fairly common. My short term disability insurance through work covers me luckily, but it took some paperwork and finagling.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is still a significant time and energy sink and will be until three months, when I can drop down to twice a day. I&#39;m using the orange without really any issue, but it doesn&#39;t go as deep as the smaller ones so they have me using the purple as well to make sure I&#39;m getting to full depth (not simultaneously).
</p>
<p>
I did manage to do a yoga class for the first time this week, which was really nice after two months of chilling on the couch. Not to mention not having inconveniently located organs in the way. I think it&#39;ll be a while until I get back to my old pretty active schedule, but it&#39;s nice to get started.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is still kind of a bummer. It&#39;s definitely pleasant to touch, but orgasm still feels pretty far off. I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised -- SSRIs caused a lot of that in my previous configuration. I had kind of thought that it would be different post surgery, but that may have been naive. I think about this perfect TikTok A LOT:

</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m super happy with my results and with the whole NYU team. It&#39;s a long wait for sure but it was worth it for me.

Why exactly did you have to take 12 weeks off instead of 6? I&#39;m going to Bluebond-Langner later this year but I can only afford to take 6 weeks off work.

You can DM me if you prefer.

The description I used a lot earlier on was &#34;the overstuffed sausage look&#34;. That and that the inside was like a brambly forest (before the stitches came out).

Wow, WOW! You are spot on saying that it‚Äôs worth the wait because really that is incredible progress and your vulva looks incredible, with the labia majora set up is amazing! I‚Äôm so happy for you and the progress of healing! It certainly can‚Äôt be taken away of how on top of things NYU Langone has been in your care!

One of the best result I&#39;ve seen. Which is saying a lot considering the previous problems you had. I&#39;m happy for you.

One of the best result I&#39;ve seen. Which is saying a lot considering the previous scary problems you had. Those scars won&#39;t be so obvious very quickly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy for you.
