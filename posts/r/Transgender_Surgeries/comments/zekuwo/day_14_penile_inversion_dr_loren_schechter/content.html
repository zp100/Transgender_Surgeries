I almost went to Loren way back in 2015. What did you generally think of him?

He’s a perfectionist and a true surgeon. I know him from work as well so I’m a bit biased but his work speaks for itself. He’s effing awesome, IMO

That’s great! I had mine in Boston. I feel equally after my outcome.
</p>
<p>
Happy healing!

I consulted him back in 2015 too. I really liked him as a doctor, but his office staff was basically impossible to work with.
</p>
<p>
OPs results look good, as I would expect.

I had the same issue with his staff. Could never get anyone to reply to me.
</p>
<p>
When I met him - he was nice enough, but very non chalant and I felt rushed. So I opted elsewhere.

My issue was that my insurance company basically begged them to take their money but every step of the way the office manager had some objection. It appeared they were trying to bill each CPT code individually, so like L orchi, R orchi, Penectomy, etc instead of the single code for GRS, in an attempt to get more money.
</p>
<p>
I was working with a patient advocate and she sent me information on maximum billed amount per CPT code, because she couldn’t disclose it to the provider, so that I could forward it to his office. Even still, they just wanted to fight and I ended up staying in the queue with Bowers and waiting it out.

I believe the waitlist is not as long as the past with his new team at Rush. I can ask when I’m in the office again next week

Dr. Schechter did mine 4 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
I am very happy and you could not ask for a nicer person than Dr. Schechter.
</p>
<p>
The care at Rush was fantastic and I do have to commend all of the nurses and aides at 12East (This is where they keep us post op).
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s worth mentioning the food was incredible. Yeah it&#39;s that good.
</p>
<p>
Bottom line, IMO Dr. Schechter is really confidence inspiring and a sweetheart.

I second that. The nurses at rush were AMAZING! And the PT in their office, Kat, is AMAZING. She has made sure that my dilation is going well. Every question answered and Dr. Schechter fellow Brielle is compassionate and going to explain everything to you whenever you have a question. I have had a minor complication of dehiscence, but this is something 25% of bottom surgery girls encounter, and not attributed to the doctor. They had me in the office in minutes once I called. I am so thankful I chose him. I’m 4 weeks next Tuesday and so happy.

I&#39;m going to see Kat this coming week. If you want to share your first name I will tell her you said hello. My name is Cheryl. Yes, Brielle is wonderful. I looked so forward to seeing her each morning when I was an inmate. I am almost 66 years old so if you see an older woman in the waiting room someday just ask if it&#39;s me. Dr. Ravi was my endo but now I have to look for someone new since he has left after this week. I have been having a difficult time trying to find another endocrinologist that specializes in gender care. Anyone you would care to suggest? Perhaps we will cross paths someday.
