I have a thing called Tailor&#39;s Bunionette behind my 5th toes. It is similar to the bunions of the big toe more common to women more than men.
</p>
<p>
This last Tuesday I had my left foot operated on by my podiatrist and expect an 8 week recovery.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I have 8.5 to 9.0 sized feet with widths on L. = E and R.= D.
</p>
<p>
After I heal from both surgeries they are supposed to be B width after a lifetime of discomfort, dysphoria and lately more amounts of physical pain.
</p>
<p>
I had never heard of this medical condition in a Transgender medical/surgical context and was curious if it had been posted previously as it has some congenital aspects in family trees.

Would you mind naming the surgeon?
</p>
<p>
How much did it cost?

It&#39;s called the Cinderella surgery. The cost varies with surgeon. $4500 - $9000 and any orthopaedic surgeon or a reconstructive foot surgeon can do it from what I read.

He is merely my podiatrist and I guess that any Podiatrist trained to do bone surgery to the feet can do what I had done.
</p>
<p>
My left foot was really painful at the far left side without padded socks and the padded socks made my feet a bit compressed inside my shoe at the outside too. I had #4 becoming a strong Hammertoe and hints of #3 starting (he decided it would correct itself or take longer to justify maybe).
</p>
<p>
Like Pari in the &#34;Cinderella&#34; foot surgery video in Germany getting her toes shortened because of hammertoes I was supposed to have #3 &amp; #4 pinned for the same reason but he did #4 &amp; #5 with 1 wire each (no shortening for mine - already very likely shorter than her result).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure but she seems to have scar lines down both sides of each foot so I wonder if she previously had more done for Bunions / Bunionettes prior to the toes being shortened.
</p>
<p>
I think maybe my #5 was pinned just for internal support for the two 5th metatarsals screwed together during healing. The wires are though all three sets of bones of both toes.
</p>
<p>
The Tailor&#39;s Bunionette is similar to a regular bunion in that the two 5th Metatarsal bones distort outward widening the foot and push the 5th toe inward.
</p>
<p>
My little toe ( #5 ) is also turned about 45 degrees from horizontal so the nail bed slants like a listing ship to Portside. It likely will stay that way, or at least close to 100%
</p>
<p>
The surgery removed the excess projection of the distortion as well as reducing the angle of the two Metatarsal bones a little so besides screwing it in place for a few months he pinned them to assure healing at the new angle. He also adjusted the 4th Metatarsals but they seem to have failed to keep the new angle as the wire is bent slightly on my followup X-rays.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Pari in Germany my whole foot is wrapped low on the ankle with it very thick on the front half. I have a velcro shoe / sandal that may be the same model she has in her video.
</p>
<p>
The scar and extra skin at the top outside of my foot used to access the bones will be treated by laser of some kind to lessen the line, though I think I was told the skin will remodel on it&#39;s own to conform to the new configuration.
</p>
<p>
My Right foot has only the Tailor&#39;s Bunionette with no Hammertoes and only a D width and no pain so I have to wonder if my insurance will try to deny coverage for matching my feet.
</p>
<p>
I had 2 private Insurance policies until the end of the month so it could be covered 100% for the procedures whatever the cost. I have no idea if there will be co-pays or deductables or whatever yet. I may have another 2nd private policy for the second foot or it may be Medicare.
</p>
<p>
The laser scar treatment was $475 for this foot and I think a little less for the other one (volume discount ?).

Can I add progress photographs ?
</p>
<p>
If so I don&#39;t see how to do this on this sub-reddit.

To do it on this post youâ€™ll need to upload to an external site like imgur, then add a link here.
</p>
<p>
Or make a new post and you can host them on reddit.

There has to be an easier way than manually typing in the imgur address but my horrible duck feet are officially &#34;coming out&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t look for them on onlyfans after I heal up from both surgeries.

And FWIW my big toe nailbeds have been altered by hangnail butchery. My toes are also very short.
