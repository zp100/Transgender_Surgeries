Hello again “Alphabet Mafia” Redditors,
</p>
<p>
I return for my 1 Month Post-Op (Vaginoplasty) AMA from Dr. Kuzon (UofM).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m documenting my journey through UofM &amp; will be using this &amp; future posts to give a more recent documentation of what it is like. An initial note for this post, I&#39;ll try my best to update it as things progress with my recovery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m STILL working on compiling photo albums/timelines still. I DO have my post-op recovery presentation file set for you all.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, I hope this helps the LGBTQ community somehow, whether that is within Michigan or abroad. So if you have questions, leave a comment &amp; I&#39;ll answer it as best I can.
</p>

Author Notes:
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
This IS A GHOST/BURNER account. Meaning I will answer them as quickly as I can
</li>
<li>
I want this to function as an “
<strong>
Ask Me Anything
</strong>
” (AMA) too. The best way to get documentation of healing and to answer relevant timeline questions is when you are in the middle of it, not when you are thinking back on it 1 year later.
</li>
<li>
I want a
<strong>
recent &amp; documented record of experiences
</strong>
<strong>
within the Michigan process and healing
</strong>
. I want to try my best to give a “live” more recent testimony &amp; documentation regarding the journey &amp; my experience with Dr. Kuzon.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
I have a Google Drive Folder link for my entire journey
</strong>
(body changes, hair removal, &amp; healing post-op). At the time of researching Dr. Kuzon while pre-op, there were not many photos of his work. I want to change that.
</li>
<li>
I want a more up-to-date
<strong>
first hand experience of in-person interactions
</strong>
&amp; experiences with Dr.Kuzon, the UofM facilities, other medical staff, &amp; hurdles I had experienced. To help other transgendered people navigate &amp; prepare for the Michigan system/UofM process or to adapt to their own journey throughout the US or abroad.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Provide copies of my resources &amp; information documents
</strong>
to HOPEFULLY help current &amp; future patients. I have mild experience in Microsoft Excel/Google Sheets, so I made my own recovery spreadsheets to help track things such as:
<ul>
<li>
Doctors comments
</li>
<li>
Dilation schedule
</li>
<li>
Friend visitation sign-up &amp; more
</li>
<li>
<strong>
I have provided a BLANK version of that document to be modified, improved, &amp; used by others in their transition journey in the Google Drive
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

I went to my pre-op at Domino&#39;s Farms a couple days ago, my pre-op with Kuzon is Sept 11. I need this but god almighty I am terrified. That&#39;s a lot of blood and a very angry looking vagina. I&#39;m also scared of that &#34;immense pain&#34; you mentioned.

If you truly are in pain when you wake up post-op, let the surgeon team know. They will up your pain killers or give you something more powerful. After about 3 or 4 days, they try to take you off the stronger stuff. By that time (for me), I was on a low Oxycodone amount (5mg). You will see that you are hitting the PCA button for more pain killers less and less as time goes on in the hospital.

I&#39;m happy to see they got your cavity in the right place. I&#39;ve seen bad results where they &#34;keyhole&#34; it and the vaginal cavity ends up below the labia instead of parenthesesed by it. That&#39;s actually higher than I expected, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen that W-shaped suture at the bottom before.
</p>
<p>
I imagine most of us, when we go in, we want to talk to the doc about what kind of vagina we want, but honestly I thought about just leaving the aesthetics up to Kuzon and talking to him about what I
<em>
don&#39;t
</em>
want, like the keyhole, and to make sure my labia majora doesn&#39;t just look like a wrinkly scrotum split down the middle.

The scheduler is the best point of reference for that answer, and it varies at any given moment. If you go back to my Pre-op post, I have my timeline of everything and how things played out.
</p>
<p>
For me, I believe it was about 5- 6 months. Once I notified UofM staff that everything was done ... 2 months passed, then I was notified by the scheduler for everything.... and then another 2 or 3 month advance notice of the surgery itself.
</p>
<p>
Hope that clarifies it a bit.

Recovery is/has gone fine. I&#39;ll have a 6 month update post in the next week for y&#39;all.  On a positive note, I have experienced my first orgasm about 2 weeks ago. 🥰

Hi, did this ever get posted? I&#39;d be interested in seeing how your recovery has gone long term. I&#39;m still in the process of prepping to see Kuzon for Bottom Surgery.

I&#39;m sorry. It hasn&#39;t. My schedule/life has been so crazy. Insane amount of overtime, teaveling for work, and keeping up with personal stuff. I&#39;ve still been documenting for the masses, but I haven&#39;t had the time to sit down to organize it and add my notes. I&#39;m so so sorry. 🥺😭

I am working on finally compiling images from hair removal, body changes, and healing. I am ALSO working on a presentation (WAY shortened) for when I have conversations with friends.
</p>
<p>
That all said, I SHOULD have a 6 month update sometime this week for y&#39;all. 😊
</p>
<p>
As for your question on scrotal tissue for the labia, yes he does.
