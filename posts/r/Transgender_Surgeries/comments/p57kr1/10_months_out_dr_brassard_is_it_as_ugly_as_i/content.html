Mine looked much like this at 10 months, too. At 18 months, you won&#39;t even recognize it anymore.

Do you mean that swelling continues to fade even after all that time? That&#39;s great.

So the issue is some people scar FAR more than others.  And it takes far longer for their scars to fade.  Personally I&#39;m one of those people where a scar will stay crazy visible for 1-3 years before is suddenly fades.
</p>
<p>
So you will probably have considerable scar reduction as more time passes.  Just takes a really long time for some of us.
</p>
<p>
Big hugs I know that&#39;s a frustrating answer.

It&#39;s not the scars, it&#39;s the discoloration that used to be around my shaft and the fact that it just looks like two big swollen sausages with a hole between them. Like, I was really hoping for inner labia and a visible clit.

Ask for a revision if you can. You know what aesthetic you want and your opinion is all that matters.

Tbh I’d also be frustrated if my result would like this. Wait another year and get a revision if it doesn’t get better?

I think u should visit ur doctor to see whether there is a need for surgical intervention. I haven&#39;t had mine yet so I&#39;m not sure how it should look like after surgery.

I think you look just fine but if you want some aesthetics done then ask your surgeon about it but remember to wait to fully heal before getting any work done.

Like others have said, you have a lot of healing to do.   I suspect that it will be fine, if not, a labiaplasty could be in order to fine tune the aesthetics.  Years ago Dr. Brassard and his mentor Menard did a better job of stating that while the one stage surgery may work for most, some folks may want to do a revision.

It’s probably not Brassard that did it but someone else. I bet you were knocked out before you saw your surgeon in the room?

Okay, first of all, that would be unethical. A doctor can get into serious trouble for doing something like that, so I don&#39;t think that happened. Second, the majority opinion in the other comments are that I&#39;m wrong and that my pussy is good and cute and that it hasn&#39;t reached its final form yet.

Ok so I’m unsure. Did you want  reassurance or the reality?.
</p>
<p>
I’m not saying you won’t ever have something nice. I’m just saying u need revision because it’s not true that it will magically become better in 2 years. In fact it might actually become more loose skin. And my bet  based on the look is that you will have irritation if you do activities outside .
</p>
<p>
I was taking in consideration that you took the time to actually write here and  to ask the opinion of others. So for me it meant that you had created in your head a standard of what you wanted it to be like.  And the fact you wrote clearly show it didn’t meet it.
</p>
<p>
So if you think it will get better because you got some comment saying that. Well good for you.
</p>
<p>
Tho if your standard of what you wanted to have is not there? Well maybe you should start thinking about revision instead of listening to people telling you things that are not actually necessarily reality or a guarantee.
</p>
<p>
You are 10 months from the operation. At 1 year mark you will have your appointment with Brassard which will tell you it’s amazing work and there is nothing to correct. Because that’s what he does.
</p>
<p>
And then because some people here told you it was great looking and you should wait.
</p>
<p>
you’ll wait past the 2 year mark deadline for provincial funding for revisions.
</p>
<p>
And then after that when it will not get better and going to continue weighting on you.
</p>
<p>
Who are you going to see for an evaluation? The guy that has monopole to almost all surgeries in Canada? For him to tell you that you need revision? I’ve dealt with them. And I can assure you they will not suddenly tell you, you need revision after they told you no. One year before. Because that would mean they didn’t do their work.
</p>
<p>
Im not being mean. I am telling you the reality. GRS Montréal will always choose their reputation before someone’s mental and physical health.
</p>
<p>
And if you don’t believe me. Ask for your surgery time. And let me know if it’s a time that reflect and transpire respect for the person living with it after.
</p>
<p>
So girl, if you are not satisfied, you won’t be in a year.
</p>
<p>
You choose.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best whatever path you choose.

Yeah well they do there.  That whole place is look google reviews for him. You will see other girls saying exact same thing.
</p>
<p>
And I’m sorry I’m not lying. She says her vagina doesn’t look like the real thing and it doesn’t.
</p>
<p>
And she will go to see Brassard for correction after the 1 year mark. He will act like he does really know what she is talking about.
</p>
<p>
This is the real face of grs Montreal. Trans girls don’t matter there. The amount of money they can make per hour is what does.
</p>
<p>
So she needs to contact her provincial government and ask for a revision outside Canada.
</p>
<p>
Just being proactive and there. And please don’t come back with your grs rainbow opinion.
</p>
<p>
You do not know what it is to be botched. This is something the person is living and will keep increasing with time until she get it fixed.
</p>
<p>
So if you are actually thinking of the girl long time. Say the truth and give her directions as what she needs to do. Don’t bullshit her as it will impact her more long term.
