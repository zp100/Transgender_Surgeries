Saw that somebody asked about European surgeons yesterday and that there is an increased interest about them in general so I figured that I may aswell share my still fairly recent surgery result. Keep in mind that this is a 2 stage approach, so besides the regular recovery timeline there will also be a revision at some point. And having minimal depth obviously also influences the aesthetic of my result cause that left more material for the appearance of the vulva. And the combined method also means that I had the mucosa of my urethra added. In my case it covers both my vagina and the area between my clitoris and vagina. But that area is still fairly sensitive so I did not spread my labias to take a picture of the area. Might do so when I post an update.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, if you happen to have any questions I will happily answer them.

Thank you so much for this post! I&#39;m scheduled with Dr. Morath for next fall and very excited. I would be very happy to see follow-up updates and maybe even one after the revision, but obviously only share what you feel comfortable with. üòä

Yeah sure that was the plan, finding information about surgeons is already not easy so just getting a general idea what recovery might look like or how stage 1 and stage 2 might differ or what differences this method has to other established methods like penile inversion or ppt seems like such a valuable thing to offer. :)

Initial consulation was late September 2019. Then somewhere in the first half of 2020 I got the approval by my health insurance to cover the costs (besides the additional aesthetic fee of around 3000‚Ç¨ that I had to cover myself) and then around August 2021 I got the call that they had a date for October 2021 for me.

I agree - zero depth for me was a fairly quick recovery!  When having my canal added later that alone seemed to  take longer - even though all the exterior and clitoris was already done and in tact.

Im glad a canal can be added later, that&#39;s pretty much the only thing holding me back (and finding a surgeon near Chicago that can perform such a surgery)

Thank you very much üòä idk I&#39;m mostly concerned with the dialating part, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll end up losing depth anyways because I&#39;m not sure I can keep up with the requirements. I mean if zero depth costs more I&#39;d just do full depth anyways, but it is something I need to juggle while I&#39;m still searching for the cash and a fairly reputable doctor nearby.

For me they were both the same costs (insurance got charged about the same for both!)  Surgery for both was pretty equal time in the OR, and recovery in the hospital was the same amount of time, therefor the cost was pretty close to equal. My insurance got charged nearly a quarter million between the two!  In the end I think total amounts paid for both was something more like $60-$70k...  I was quoted $44k out of pocket when I started in case insurance wouldn&#39;t cover it, and then again $40k for the canal, again just in case insurance wouldn&#39;t cover it. I fully intended to get personal loans if insurance wouldn&#39;t help. In the end, for both, my total out of pocket costs was $5k - which was my out of pocket deductible each time (since the surgeries were in seperate years, deductible applied to each year)
</p>
<p>
Dilaating isn&#39;t that bad. I&#39;m sposed to do it three times a day but its not possible. I do it early AM for 20-30 min, go to work and usually do it at night again before bed. On the weekends I get my 3 in per day. I dont loose depth at all, if anything I&#39;ve gained a little (I might be trying to gain some with just a little pressure each time to stretch things ;) )  its a chore for sure, but its truly just not that bad.

Oh and also, I&#39;ve missed a day or two in a row. This doesn&#39;t cause depth loss!  It does cause it to be just a little tight though when you dilate again.  Just have to go slow and work it back up to the girth of the dilator again, easily doable in just that session...and then its back to normal.

That&#39;s good, yeah at that rate I&#39;d probably be better off going full depth, I assume insurance would probably be quicker to cover it too, I only had to pay $2700 out of pocket for my orchi. Thank you very muchüòä I hope like hell Eskenazi gets a good surgeon at some point because otherwise Chicago is the next closest (unless Columbus Ohio or Nashville TN has a good surgeon)

Oh my!  Go to columbus if thats a good option for you!    My surgeon is there and he&#39;s just incredible as a person and surgeon. Also you could probly get it done pretty quick as his wait times are around 3-6 months.
</p>
<p>
Check my picks for results if you want to see his work. Ive seen other girls results from him and they are all pretty well on par if not better than mine.
</p>
<p>
I can give you whatever details you may need.

Those results are spectacular, I&#39;m definitely going to have to look him up. Does he accept Anthem Blue Cross? I&#39;m still probably a couple years away from doing it but I figure now is as good of a time to start preparing.

Yeah, my recovery was really smooth so far. Sitting is still uncomfortable due to the scars not being quite there yet, still having some swelling around the clitoris and urethra area and going up in dilator size even with my finger-length vaginal canal is also tiresome but other than that I am having no complains at all.

Hey! Sorry for digging out this old post - the results look amazing!
<br>
I want exactly the same depth for very similar reasons, I just wanted to ask a couple questions:
<br>
Did you need to have laser hair removal before the surgery? If yes, for how long and what areas?
<br>
Was the 2 stage approach your choice or was it dr Morath&#39;s recommendation?
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much :)
