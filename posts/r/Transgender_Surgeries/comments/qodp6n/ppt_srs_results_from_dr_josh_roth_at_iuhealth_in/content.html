Not much out there in terms of pictures of Dr Josh Roth’s work. I said screw it, Imma be the first so i hope you enjoy my kinda essay-ish review of getting the robotic peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Going into major surgery was kinda scary for it being my first time, I woke up unable to move hehe. Major trip with my 10 hour surgery. All the nurses are super nice, making everything a lot easier.
</p>
<p>
I had no issues with the surgery itself, the only thing was pain control.
</p>
<p>
Day 1 coming out of my long surgery most of my pain was from my stomach area where they had the robot in and cut up my peritoneum. They gave me opis for the pain thank god.
</p>
<p>
Day 2 my catheter was not emptying properly, not sure why my pee is so viscous and won&#39;t drain but it wouldn&#39;t drain unless it was on the floor so we used bed pads to lay it on. Bladder spasms were pretty painful but they prescribed a lot of drugs for them.
</p>
<p>
Day 3 my catheter issue was fixed but the day before they switched out my epidural bag and forgot to turn the machine on. For 12 hours I was without an epidural as they continued their leniency of pain meds thinking I had an epidural. The brief boost of pain meds kept me going as well as my strong pain tolerance, but it was hell.Other than these two main incidents, my pain was managed. My epidural doc saw what had happened and gave me a big ol dose of pain away enough to make even my stomach feel great and pain free.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m currently on day 8 at night writing this, and I&#39;m curious how you guys think the results are looking. I still have yet to tell with my stomach and groin area being extremely bloated and swelling but i&#39;m hoping for the best!For anyone going to Roth, here&#39;s a look at my current results, ill keep posting at some milestones to see where recovery goes.

Edit Morning of post above, 11/7/21
</p>
<p>
Forgot to mention small amounts of clear-red fluid that discharges from the vagina, it has a slight odor and i was told it was due to all the blood and other things happening during recovery. During hospital stay with packing in, my whole room stank much worse. Was kinda iffy about it but they assured me its fine and the drainage would do that normally. I still have some that comes out so i sleep and lay on a bed pad to keep that weird discharge cleaned and off sheets. Not as stinky as before but still has a smell and is annoying ruining everywhere i sit and anything i wear. Maybe this affects anyone healing? I am flushing with soapy water daily as per Dr Roths suggestions.
</p>
<p>
I also have nice incisions on my stomach except one where I think the layers of scar tissue decided to bond to each other. Will this end up looking obvious after swelling goes or will it stay as a surgery reminder??? Hard to show off with camera but one is deff indented in the skin while the rest are more normal. Nitpicking yeah but im curious

Your aftercare story is a little scary, but to me, those are some amazing photos for 8 days in. Are you happy with the results?

Its a little painful and a chore to take care of but I am really really happy to get this done. Being flat feel so weird and freeing AHHH its so nice,
</p>
<p>
After removing the packing and stent, He did rub on the clitoris to see if i had sensation and it seems Ii do. its a little raw and painful but I DO have sensation. I hope 4 months in ill be able to feel more and have less pain.
<br>
Idk its so weird i love it, so hard to explain &gt;.&lt;
</p>
<p>
If im happy atm, idk yet. I know the swelling will go down and stuff but atm just crossing my fingers everything goes well. if it does then probably yeah I like them :D just an anxious girl!

No problem, I&#39;ve been told by numerous people on and off reddit to not go due to lack of results and stories. I wanted it bad enough so Ill be the one to show that maybe he&#39;s an okay surgeon. One before him was shitty, but no one knows about roth so ill start the results list ;)

To be honest I did post about my revision surgery with Dr. Roth and that disappointing outcome and experience. During my first consult, he told me he was going to win my trust after the whole Gallagher nightmare. In the end, he only made things worse for me on several levels. It was bad enough, that it was Anthem that stepped in and hooked me up with the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, to connect me with the care I needed.
</p>
<p>
Like I said, I&#39;m not holding a grudge against Dr. Roth, I&#39;m glad you posted your experience for people to see. I wish Dr. Roth the best, but if you think IU-Health is Trans-friendly outside their small LGBT surgery group, my experience says otherwise.

It looks like a great start! You could have said you went to Dr. Chettawut and I would have believed you. Beautiful suture work and that fourchette is to die for. You should be very please so far despite the hospital glitches. I&#39;m so happy they didn&#39;t toss you out of your recovery room halfway through your stay. WIN!
</p>
<p>
This early result is looking like the best work I&#39;ve seen from Dr. Roth, it&#39;s great to see him seasoning into a good GRS surgeon --despite working for IU-Health. Unfortunately, even with your stellar results, I would never recommend anyone go to IU-Health for GRS surgery after what they allowed Princess Tik Tok Gallagher MD to get away with.
</p>
<p>
Keep us posted on the healing and sensation.

For a little over a week you&#39;re looking pretty great! As for the abdominal scars, those should get significantly better and with proper scar treatment hardly even be visible after a suitable amount (12-18 months) of time.

Any chance you have some current photos you are willing to show how it all turned out 2 years later? I know many of us are wanting to know how the scars healed.
