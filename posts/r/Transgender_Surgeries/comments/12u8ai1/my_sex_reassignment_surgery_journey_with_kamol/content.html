Hello everyone, just wanna share my experience for my SRS journey.
</p>
<p>
Just recently, I decided to undergo Sex Reassignment Surgery Operation.
</p>
<p>
So, I had come up to find a hospital where SRS is performed with great surgeons for reasonable amount.
</p>
<p>
When I arrived at Kamol Cosmetic Hospital, all the necessary tests were done specifically laboratory tests like Covid Test, Assessment, Blood Test, EKG, X-Ray. I was always with their staff and a nurse to accompany me wherever I need to go during the process. I was always informed what will be the next procedure to do and where should it be done. Doctor Kamol is a very talented man. During my consultation to him, that’s the time I finally met him. He knows what to do or what is not necessary to do and what to recommend you. Even though you have a stuff in mind, and you tell him, he can justify if why should do it or why should not do it.
</p>
<p>
The surgery went well. I was being hospitalized for 6 nights. And in fact, I was discharged already because thankfully there was no problems or complications at all. I managed to recover quickly with the help of doctors and nurses in the hospital. They do the rounds every morning and afternoon to check each patient and monitor their pain, progress and the like.
</p>
<p>
So, I spent 7 days 6 nights in the hospital after the operation. I can really tell you that everything was neat, and things needed to be sterilized are sterilized. The nurses were always there to assist you for everything I need, or I will be needing. The quality or standard of how they care the Patients are really or surprisingly better than of others. After my hospitalization, I was transferred to a nearest hotel from the hospital which named as the K Garden Hotel where I can continue my recovery for my previous surgery. This place is so clean, peaceful and have staffs to attend to you as well every time you need something. Medical care is still available even though I was transferred because, they have a service car for the patients with driver where I can go to the hospital for cleaning, follow-ups with doctors, and other concerns.
</p>
<p>
The staffs and nurses provided me a guide on how to take care properly the part where I have my operation. They also provided me some medications like antibiotics and pain killers just incase I will be needing it. And all my medications are included on my hospitalization bill, which are great because when you are their patients, they will serve you as best as possible. They also informed me all the rules I must know especially when I will return to my country specifically, about dilation rules which you need a set of dilators for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Except the medical treatment which I had undergone in this hospital, I can really recommend how their whole organization works with you well. The love and care of the staffs for you is so wonderful! Because I came there alone which I never felt. Because, they are always on your side, especially during the hospital procedures like major treatments, consultations, follow-ups, financial matters and everything. Really, EVERYTHING!
</p>
<p>
I highly recommend KAMOL HOSPITAL to everyone who is looking for cosmetics and surgeries. Words can’t describe the wonderful work you’ve done on me. I am delighted ‘coz I trusted you and you’ve made it possible to do what I asked you. I advise each and every one to consult and try Kamol Cosmetic Hospital for every concerns you have physically.

Why would you want the cosmetic variation rather than the real thing? I wouldn&#39;t get a cosmetic surgery
</p>
<p>
what is clickbait?

To be honest i do my surgery with kamol in November and what i read naw is to much so i think is fake .the nurses are very nice yes the clinic are very clean yes the stuff in garden hotel are so nice and help yes its truth but the organization at the clinic are not good and yes they give you antibiotic pills but for the pain killer you need to fight with them for that and like all girls say dr kamol dont give you time in consultation and they dont tel you everything before surgery .

have you asked the attending nurses for painkillers? because during my follow ups i&#39;m just asking the nurses or staffs for my antibiotics and painkillers. they will write it on your consultation paper. the name of the medicines and how many tabs per day you need to consume. they just provided me with those and it is included already on my payment for my hospitalization.

I was there i come back to my contry just one day before i hear about this poor women and i was shoked but the truth thats this woman dont do the surgery with kamol she do surgery with another doctor in another clinic and she have problems health. About the bouton when i arrive to thaillande before my surgery they tel me about the bouton if i have any problems so its not true they propose that before the women die .i suspect its fake a compte because its to much perfect for kamol but some things are truth  other things are not .

For those looking for context:
</p>
<p>
There is a Reddit thread:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/107tx69/please_be_cautious_and_mindful_of_the_risks_of/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/107tx69/please_be_cautious_and_mindful_of_the_risks_of/</a>
And a Twitter thread:
<a href="https://twitter.com/thaisrscom/status/1611172704077631489" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/thaisrscom/status/1611172704077631489</a>
</p>
<p>
The Twitter thread leads to the below message, which seems unsigned but is written from either the clinic that did the surgery (Kamol, as far as I understand) or a third party surgery-support business that was supporting the patient.
</p>
