Pics included at bottom of post, sorry for formatting, on mobile.
</p>
<p>
I had stage 1 with Dr Ley at 19 turned 20 in the hospital, surgery went textbook. At the time I did not know I had EDS, which means any measures that could have been taken to minimize complications weren’t.
</p>
<p>
First three days I was screaming bloody murder from bladder spasms, couldn’t get enough morphine. Was given a pill that turned my pee orange which helped tremendously. Otherwise everything was going fine until post op day 10. I believe that was my first day home, I went to do my morning dilation, exhausted, still completely numb and not really able to see where my vaginal opening was due to some labia tearing. Well my perineum had opened up in my sleep just enough to create a flap right below my vagina leading to a space between my rectum and vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
I accidentally dilated into this space, now, you may be wondering how in the hell I could I have done that?? Ehlers-Danlos is to blame. My skin was so weak it just separated completely painlessly until I hit a nerve which is when I realized I had fucked up.  I took the dilator out of me and I started to bleed like a freshly tapped wine barrel. It was extremely traumatizing, had to call Meltzers emergency number on a Saturday morning and I was told to stop dilating until Monday when I could go to the office.
</p>
<p>
When I finally got into the office the first words out of my surgeons mouth was “that’s the worst dehiscence I’ve ever seen.” I was given a special #0 dilator to try and keep depth while I healed. I continued to use #0 for five weeks, I fell way behind and lost 1.5” of depth and A LOT of girth. I started out with 6” and ended up with 4” with #2 when I stopped dilating around 6 or 8 months in due to the pain it was causing me.
</p>
<p>
When I stopped dilating I fell into a deep depression for about a year due to sensitivities and having to cope with the possible loss of my vagina because it was simply too painful to maintain. I had a mental breakdown over it. Probably still suffering from the burnout. I was so distraught about how awful my recovery went, I felt like I made the biggest mistake of my life. Having paid out of pocket for it made me feel like I wasted what could have been invested for my future. The money I thought I wasted was from a car accident that left me disabled and eventually leading to me finding out I had EDS 4 years later.
</p>
<p>
I had a talk with my surgeon around 1.5 years post op about creating a clitoral hood in office because even slightly brushing my clit was searing pain. Took a couple weeks to recover from that, extremely happy with the results. 6 months after my hood was created my nerves started to calm down and I could finally touch myself without extreme pain.
</p>
<p>
Having found out that I have Ehlers-Danlos finally gave an explanation as to why my recovery was the way it was. Weighed 140lb going in, I was moderately healthy and active. Coming out weighing 115, developed POTS immediately after my surgery so I deconditioned quite rapidly.
</p>
<p>
I had a friend go through with Melzter and follow up 4 months later for her labiaplasty. She has absolutely no issues and flew through recovery and is absolutely pleased with her results to this day.
</p>
<p>
I still have about 2” of depth and I am still dealing with granulation due to the vagina collapse. I can reach my g-spot and fit 2 fingers comfortably. Orgasmic both vaginally and with my clit. Around 6 months ago I started progesterone and it has helped tremendously with my flora and self lubrication, at times it can be a bit much.
</p>
<p>
Being local I check up with Dr. Ley a few times a year to make sure everything is still healing properly. Haven’t had the balls to go under again to get my labia finished and have the excess erectile tissue taken care of. Maybe next year.
</p>
<p>
I have reached out to Dr. Heidi Wittenberg to do a peritoneal pull through depth revision on me. she has experience with EDS patients so I will need to have my consult in person to determine if I am even candidate due to the nature of my tissue and possible abdominal issues. Likely something I will have done only if insurance someday covers it.
</p>

Thanks for posting that. It may help someone else in the future.

What could have been done if you&#39;d known, and how would it have changed things?

<p>
By POTS do you mean this?

Different suturing technique or more sutures. Leaving the packing in longer before dilating and minimizing any unnecessary activity. Even just moving out of bed, should have stayed 2 weeks in the surgical center instead of 9 days. I started getting out of bed a few days later than most and didn’t start walking to day 7 which is considered late.
</p>
<p>
I honestly have no clue how it would have changed things, the tearing would have probably been minimal. I would have felt a whole lot better that I was recovering slower than others because my body is just different and certainly wouldn’t have pushed myself to be “normal” active at home.
</p>
<p>
Yup, that’s the one

I’m really sorry this happened.
</p>
<p>
For Dr. Ley’s office to tell you to stop dilating is really extreme. They even make you sign an agreement before your first dilation acknowledging what can happen if you cease dilating.
</p>
<p>
You’ve posted many of these images before awhile back. Holy shit...at your labia majora tearing like that. I remember thinking something wasn’t right about it. The Ehlers-Danlos was explains it. Who diagnosed you with that and POTS?
</p>
<p>
Wound dehiscence happens to 85% of the patients Meltzer’s office sees. I wonder what the stat is for it occurring to an individual with Ehlers-Danlos. Probably near 100% I would imagine.

<p>
First saw a rheumatologist who kinda suspected I was hypermobile, saw a third spinal surgeon as to why im in pain, he took one look at me with me medical history and said I have EDS.
</p>
<p>
Also saw a hip surgeon about a week after the spine dude who also said I likely have EDS and he wouldn&#39;t even try to repair my labrum. &#34;If we do this surgery will it likely fail in a very short amount of time. you&#39;ll likely be in more pain even if it does work&#34;
</p>
<p>
after revisiting with my rheumatologist she concurred the EDS diagnosis. Found out there is a neurologist EDS specialist in Phoenix, made an appointment with him, he ordered autonomic function testing for me which showed I had POTS and coincidentally MCAS. (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome)

Sorry you’ve had such a rough go of it. Chronic pain is hell. Also dying at “Ive not got the balls to go back”. If you didn’t mean that as a joke, it’s pure comedic gold anyway :)

I had one spot above my clit after getting my hood with a hard scar about an inch long, took about a year to soften up and fade. The scar tissue around my perineum and labia is very smooth, it’s kinda weird.

Do you have any regrets getting SRS after having going through the complications you went through? I&#39;m almost two year post op and had my first stage procedure with Dr. Meltzer. I too encountered a couple of immediate complications from the surgery one of them being wound dehiscence right at the perineal area and urinary complications. Thank you for sharing your story. We need to hear stories like yours so people know what to expect. SRS is no walk in the park and its not always rainbows and sunshine. Post op depression is very common.

I can&#39;t really have any regrets since the complications weren’t my fault. Honestly very very happy I went with the Meltzer Clinic since they are local. Dr Ley has been extremely compassionate towards my case, I was given her personal number for any immediate concerns and she covered all her fees to make my clit hood.
</p>
<p>
I do not even want to imagine what would have happened if i needed to travel for SRS.

I don&#39;t regret transitioning but I do regret getting my bottom surgery. I think its because I did encounter complications immediately after my surgery. But, I&#39;m glad to hear that Dr. Ley covered your fees to do your clitoral hooding and that you are happy with your decision. It make sense that you decide getting your bottom surgery locally. It wasn&#39;t the case for me. At the time of my research and surgery, there wasn&#39;t anything reputable and highly recommended in my local city. And the Meltzer Clinic came highly reputable because I found out that model Andreja Pejic went to Dr. Meltzer for her bottom surgery. I had to travel to Arizona and leave Arizona with urinary complications. sigh. :( Today, I go to all my doctor appointments and follow ups locally through Mount Sinai. It just makes things easier. Thanks for sharing.

The Meltzer Clinic is very responsive. Especially for us locals. I had quite a few early complications myself and they have been really supportive.

Just came here to say that you look fantastic externally in that first photo, you look a lot like I did pre-T (AFAB trans guy).
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;re able to get coverage and fix the issues that you&#39;re having. You&#39;re really strong to have coped with all the pain and complications.

What do u mean? I am talking about the pain and complications that she has had. Its painful to read because I always imagine stuff I read  and it&#39;s not pretty. It&#39;s how people cant see blood and they get sick. The complications and the success of today&#39;s techniques on receiving the same physiology like a biological woman is the problem why I won&#39;t do srs in the near future. Actually is still haven&#39;t started HRT, but I hope when I do start and would be on hrt for a few years, that the technology would improve....
