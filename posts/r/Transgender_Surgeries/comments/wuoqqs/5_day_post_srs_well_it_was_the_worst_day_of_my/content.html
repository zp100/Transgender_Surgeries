I had surgery on a Monday, didn&#39;t poop till the Friday, and spent the 48 hours prior with the worst constipation cramps I ever had (and I was a junkie for a decade).
</p>
<p>
That was the worst post op poop and thank god, even tho the tramadol kept me super constipated for weeks after it neber for close to being that bad again.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry to hear you&#39;ve been struggling so much.
