but I think it deserves its own post.
</p>
<p>
It is now 12 days post op for me, and my life is pretty back to normal. I had simultaneous GCS and BA with Dr. McGinn.
</p>
<p>
I was cleared to go home on day 10 and told I can resume most light activities (except working out and sex) as I feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Since then, I’ve taken one little step after another into life and I’m feeling great! I’m driving for short drives. Ive been shopping. I’ve gone out to eat. I can sit for about a half hour with a donut cushion.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon instructed me to take daily walks, and I’m going out for a mile at a time.
</p>
<p>
I’m already caught up on my work email, and on Monday, I plan to return to the office for 2-3 hours a day. Fortunately I have a sit-stand desk both in my office and at home. This allows me to vary my position and stay productive with minimal discomfort.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you read that right. I’m returning to work 13 days after gender confirmation surgery.
</p>
<p>
Please note, no one can count on a speedy recovery like this. However, I’m sharing as an example of what’s possible in one extreme. We won’t all need 6 weeks off work.
</p>
<p>
I got lucky, but I was also prepared. I’m in excellent shape and eat very healthy. I spent extra time getting everything ready before surgery. I also have a history of recovering quickly. I was back at work 9 days after FFS with no issues.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, ask away!

Oh yeah, I agree 100%. No one should try to do this. It cannot be planned or counted on. It’s just sort of happening. I have the next 4 weeks blocked off to be at home, but there’s no way I could do it. I am going stir crazy.
</p>
<p>
I’m not returning to work because I have to. I’m doing it because I want to.
</p>
<p>
It’s also totally unclear to me how spending all day writing messages on reddit is going to help me heal better than spending half the day writing messages on reddit and the other half the day writing messages to my work colleagues.

Can you tell more about your regime ? I&#39;m interested in eating healthier food (but struggle due to mediocre habits)

Were you looking into other surgeons? What made you decide to go with Dr. McGinn?
</p>
<p>
She’s definitely on my short list, as she’s been around forever, and every account I read of surgery (even those with complications) seem to like her.

I look into some other surgeons, but Dr. McGinn was my first choice for several reasons: mostly because she has been putting out consistent quality results for years, she is pretty close to where I live, she could me my desired timeline for surgery, and she offered simultaneous breast augmentation as an option. After I had my in-person consultation, I knew she was the one.

Awesome- thanks!
</p>
<p>
I haven’t seen nearly as many of her BA results compared to SRS. Is one significantly more painful than the other for you? And if you’re willing to post pics I’d love to see more of her work!

That’s really awesome to hear! I hope I can have the same kind of recovery time. I have simultaneous GCS and BA coming up at the end of this month and I’m a little worried about having to deal with top and bottom pain during recovery. I use a wheelchair part time and need to use my upper body to help get up and sit and move around and I worry a bit about not being able to get up and walk enough to help the healing. Anything else to look out for when you’re stacking procedures like that?

Like you I heal quickly, after a 7 hour FFS, face and neck lift, I was back to work flying at week three.  It would have been earlier, but I was waiting for my FAA authorization to return.  I am now looking at GCS, it’s recovery and how to pick a surgeon.  My criteria is as follows.  Must be in network for BCBS/Heath partners.  I want a surgeon that is an artist and will give me a clean, nice looking vagina.  I’m scared of the bad ones happening.  I want control Of peeing and feeling, functional is a must.  And recovery time less than 4-6months.  I live in Minneapolis.  But I’ve heard bad things about MAYO and the U of Mn has such a new program.  Any advice?  By the way, my name is Jenn. And I had my FFS with dr Mayer 2 years ago
