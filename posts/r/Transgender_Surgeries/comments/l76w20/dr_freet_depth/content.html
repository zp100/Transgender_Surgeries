Thanks for your write-up and pics!  Admittedly we can&#39;t see too much from this pic but I hope she heals well :)

I tried to post a better angle but taking a pic one handed is difficult.

Huh, neat. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve seen using those dilators during surgery recovery. Did your surgeon say if there would be an advantage to using the silicone ones over the standard rigid GRS dilators that Soulsource makes?

Technically, these are soul source as well. They&#39;re equally good GRS dilators, and Dr. Freet tends to think they&#39;re more comfortable.

I knew they&#39;re Soul Source dilators as well, and if they work that&#39;s great. It&#39;s just unusual to see those ones being used instead of the rigid dilators that were designed with the curve specifically for GRS, thus the curiousity on your surgeon&#39;s decision. I have been considering picking up a set because silicone is easier to care for and won&#39;t dent/crack/make loud noise if accidentally dropped in the shower.

Sorry if I&#39;m not always understanding questions. I&#39;m legit on the spectrum. :( It took me a bit to get what you were asking.

I think it&#39;s exactly that. His office advised that I could purchase a different set, if I felt inclined. He mostly sited ease of care, and patient comfort, as it doesn&#39;t force seams and inflamed tissue the way rigid plastic does, while still getting the job done.

Hey do you know if it’s flaccid or erect length that indicates how much depth you get?

So, I had about 3in erect (don&#39;t know cm of the top of my head sorry.) And have about 6 in depth. Technically, the skin of the penis was only really used to create my vulva lining, and part of my labia minora. The main bulk of my depth was made by a scrotal graft. According to doctor Freet with scrotal graft PIV (pretty much the standard surgery) the limit and determination of depth is how far towards your peritoneal cavity the surgeon can go. My graft, even now, has sensation. So phallus size pre op is not as big a concern. Hope this helps &lt;3

Basically, you&#39;ll be good on depth if you&#39;re getting standard piv. The scrotal tissue is super elastic, and the graft sensation is good. :)

seems to me they would be more comfy as being silicone they would conform to you unlike the rigid types, there is one dr in india I believe that uses an inflatable dialator  that would be interesting until you got a flat mid dialation LOL

I had heard of those... But yeah, it&#39;s definitely more comfortable. It&#39;s firmer than you&#39;d think, but with a little give. That helps inflamed tissue and stitches.
