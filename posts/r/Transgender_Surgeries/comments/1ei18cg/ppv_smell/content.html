Hi team
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a bit over 2 months post op PPV.
</p>
<p>
My vag smells kinda musty. Not like gross, just not clean. I can smell it in the morning, when I take my pad off, sometimes just after sitting for prolonged periods.
</p>
<p>
I douche 2xday with iodine solution and sterile water as requested by my surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I use the Lifestyles lube (Australia). It&#39;s a basic lube.
</p>
<p>
What can I use to correct this smell? I think 2 months is possibly too soon to try and adjust the PH, and I&#39;m thinking maybe do a course of sterilube. Thoughts?
</p>

Try water based ph balanced lube and vaginal moisturiser like “YES” and if not required just use saline or distilled water and check back in a couple of days. It should reduce. Ppv is not supposed to have it but it’s more likely due to lube- even medical lube as it recovers over 2-6 months! Fem was is a good idea but I guess it’s more about masking so it’s a secondary option Predominantly it could be a ph issue since you have been douching ppv and also lube might have hindered its normal biome development

Yeah. I have that smell in the mornings, too. I pretty much do a sitz salt wash twice a day. I have this damp smell when I remove my underwear in the morning

I&#39;ve discussed vaginal health, and Angel in other posts.
</p>
<p>
What procedure did you have for you PPV? I&#39;m assuming scrotal tissue, but could be PPT
</p>
<p>
Over cleaning can be just as bad as no cleaning. Excess iodine is great for sterilization, and preventing an infection, but can be damaging/aggravating the canal tissue....
</p>
<p>
Dead tissue treated this way will cause odor, and overly dry/aggravated tissue is the same.
</p>
<p>
Can you see why inflammation, granulation, or discharge before douching?
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s not a colon procedure then I can best recommend a PH balanced water based lube to promote healthy microbiome growth.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not the most familiar with PPV techniques, but a lot of my time has been spent of plain PPT and PIV research.

Regardless of the tissue; if it&#39;s not a colon graft then water based is your friend. I&#39;m not going to argue against your surgeon, but excess cleaning with harsher chemicals will cause their own problem.
</p>
<p>
The musty smell could be from the iodine (which does have a tarter smell when dried), or from the canal skin/surface being dried/aggravated.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m no doctor (as said), but my current guidance 2 months out from my medical team (after a PPT revision from a PIV) is douching 1-2 times weekly max with simple saline. That was even after being released from the revision.
</p>
<p>
The canal tissue is going to adapt to being a closed off environment that no longer needs to protect external anatomy. It&#39;ll become softer, more pliable, paper, and etc. Using a safe PH balanced lube (like good clean love) will allow the canal to be maintained in a more acidic state that helps prevent malicious bacteria + promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria commonly seen in natal vaginas (like lactobacillus). These bacteria eat the discharge/waste generated by the tissue shedding in your new naughty bits
</p>
<p>
And please remember that vaginas do smell. Even 100% healthy ones with have a scent. If there&#39;s any discharge (which is very common for all people with vaginas), then it&#39;ll regularly give off a scent. Common things to look for are a musty, earthy, or slightly tart smell, and that&#39;ll be your sign that healthy bacteria (like lactobacillus) are eating waste.
</p>
<p>
Think of the tart earthy musty scent of healthy pickled food. Something like that, but not snacking you in the face is a sign of a healthy hoo-ha

Hey, thanks for the essay!
</p>
<p>
PPV with scrotal flap.
</p>
<p>
It is water based lube, but not ph balanced.
</p>
<p>
Based on the feedback I&#39;ll change lubes and work with that for a while.
</p>
<p>
I went to Theerapong, he&#39;s advised me to keep doing twice daily til 3 months. If the lube fixes the issue great, if it does not it I&#39;ll be at about 3mo to look at adjusting the schedule.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the info!

Hmm,  ? Well ? I also use a 6 ft long shower head pulse jet on low luke warm water once a week now only to flush out after Theerapong&#39;s Sigmoid Colon Revision 2022 fall - a few times , not many times there&#39;s some discharge the last 2 years production naturally discharge ? but when it did , the smell was not good - never had a problem so far after using the shower head and just warm water douching  ?

I&#39;m about  2 months post-op myself (suporn clinic), and they specifically warn against using silicone lubes for the first year because it will cause issues like you have. That is because you can&#39;t wash it out with water, so it just accumulates in the canal and sticks around.
</p>
<p>
What you need to use is a water solvable lube so you can clean it all out while douching. The lube brings a lot of the healing gunk out with it when you douche.
</p>
<p>
Also, make sure that the iodine wash is the last step of your douce/ dialation routine, so it sticks around in the canal and continues to keep things sterile for the time being until you are more healed.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I found out that the lube that you mentioned has both silicone based lube and water-based lubes, so you will need to clarify what you use.
</p>
<p>
Also, even if you use a water-based lube, it can be a good idea to get one that is glycerine free as it can also cause microbiological growth as it is a sugar alcohol.

Hey!! So I did saline and iodine too for the first 8 weeks and then switched to just distilled water now. I’m at 10 weeks. I was using slipper stuff lube because it’s pretty cheap for a large quantity. Recently moved to good clean love lube about a week ago because it’s more ph balanced. Downside is it’s a lot more expensive I haven’t had any smell using those two types of water based lube. Hope that helps 🫶

I wonder if the iodine is just smelly? I know it can be pretty pungent.
</p>
<p>
You could also try sleeping in underwear made in a breathable fabric to keep the air flowing down there.
</p>
<p>
Truth is, kind of like foreskin, the labia and sweat/oils do build up and that’s just part of life. You could just be reacting to that less then fresh but not dirty odor.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever thought about changing the solution down the line when you are more healed up?
</p>
<p>
My partner douches with a mixture of 1 tablespoon distilled white in about two cups of water and It has a pretty minimal smell the day after.

Yeah, I think it&#39;s worse than that - my partner is afab and has never had odour at this level.
</p>
<p>
Vinegar? Yeah makes sense, acidifies the environment which is known to promote a healthy microbiome.
</p>
<p>
I was thinking hopefully at 3mo I could probably start something like that.
</p>
<p>
My nurse (from TH) just suggested feminine wash but tbh I&#39;ve only heard bad things.

I have a similar smell. 12 weeks post op. Penile inversion with peritoneum graft. Not strong but a mild musty smell. I have never douched. My doc says not to do it and it is not needed. He says the smell is normal and not to worry about it. I believe the smell is as the bacteria in the new vag as they form and grow. Think cis vag smell.
