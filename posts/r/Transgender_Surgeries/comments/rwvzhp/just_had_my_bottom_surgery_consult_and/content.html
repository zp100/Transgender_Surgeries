How did the consult go? Did he have results photos to share? Would love to hear any details you feel comfortable sharing, since he&#39;s such a new surgeon and there are so few reviews for him.

He showed me before and after photos. He essentially explained everything from consultation onwards. He told me in detail what to expect in the hospital, when I‚Äôm at home, and follow up appointments

He‚Äôs an new/unknown surgeon so quite risky. Also trained with Dr Kathy Rumer which is a bit concerning.

Everyone had to train with someone. He also spent time training overseas. Just because he spent time with Kathy doesn‚Äôt mean he is her.  I‚Äôve heard nothing but great things about him from my friend who had surgery with him!

New surgeons have a higher rate of complications. There‚Äôs even a paper on it in the wiki.

Maybe‚Ä¶ but most new surgeons aren‚Äôt fellowship trained for a year, perform additional training overseas, and only operate on trans/non binary patients. Most of these surgeons do a weekend course or train with an existing surgeon for a few weeks before doing this stuff.
</p>
<p>
He is going to do my surgery, and friends of mine are in the process of scheduling with him.  Happy to let y‚Äôall know how it goes. We all want to same thing, I have no doubt he will get me there.

I&#39;ve got a consultation with Dr. Hanna next week.  I&#39;m curious how confident you are in his consistency and results after yours, and have you spoken with any other surgeons you would compare that with?
</p>
<p>
You scheduled surgery with him, it looks like in this thread, which is great!  I&#39;m also really impressed with his training record and history of fellowships, and how he exclusively works with Trans and NB patients; ultimately I&#39;m just left wondering how he&#39;s performed since (he said his practice opened last October).

There aren‚Äôt many surgeons who are trained like he is. Most are trained in plastics and spent all their time with cis gendered patients I‚Äôm training and practice. This is all he does and all he has done for a while now.
</p>
<p>
I used to be an OR nurse, and from what I used to see, training is still surgery. Honestly, the trainees are the ones that do 95% of the surgery in my experience anyways. That‚Äôs something else, he doesn‚Äôt have trainees with him, so you know it‚Äôs him doing procedure.
