I had a bilateral orchi three weeks ago and it feels like the end of the cord has healed and fused to the inside of the scrotum and is pulling it upward toward where I used to tuck my testicles. Is this normal?

What you describe is known by the medical term as ‚Äútethering‚Äù, where the spermatic cord was not trimmed short enough to retreat back up into the inguinal canal (Edit) and attaches to tissue outside the canal. I had the same thing happen to me and it resulted in me seeking a different surgeon to perform a cord resection. In my case, eight-months after the original surgery I was in constant pain all the way up the cord, into the abdomen and I found Dr. Karen Boyle in Towson, MD (now retired). She is a urologist and was a member of Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner‚Äôs original team when she performed vaginoplasty surgery in Baltimore, before she left to practice at NYU Langone.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Boyle used the same midline incision as the original surgery and re-sectioned almost 2‚Äù of cord to ensure it retreated back up in the inguinal canal. When I went back for my one-month follow up, she assured me I was healed in good shape and having two incisions in the same place would not interfere with my vaginoplasty. When I later consulted with Dr. RBBL for the vaginoplasty, she confirmed what Dr. Boyle told me.
</p>
<p>
All of this could have been avoided if the original surgeon was experienced with MtF transgender patients and knew the cords needed to be sectioned short enough to retreat in the canals during healing. I didn‚Äôt know that is what I needed, so I couldn‚Äôt advocate for myself in that regard.
</p>
<p>
For any sisters reading this who pursues an orchiectomy prior to vaginoplasty, make sure if at all possible you seek out a surgeon experienced in the needs of a transgender woman, (Edit)
<strong>
<em>
AND
</em>
</strong>
make damned sure you have the conversation with the surgeon to advocate your desired outcome from the surgery.

What&#39;s so strange is that when the surgeon (who is on the list in fact and handles trans patients regularly) explained what they were going to be doing. What you described is what they described as the goal. Cutting more and having it retreat, but they didn&#39;t say this was how it would present nor do I recall this coming up. On top of everything else the sack folds over itself and hurts while sitting. If i sit leaning forward I get the cord pain. üò≠ this is not fun for sure

Understood. Mine was the right cord. The sectioned end swelled about the size of the thumbnail and adhered to the base of the penis. It was under constant pressure against the inner thigh, and depending on how I moved, would pull on the
<strong>
<em>
entire
</em>
</strong>
length of the cord. I was miserable. When I consulted with the original surgeon, he was reluctant to perform the re-section but finally relented and set a surgery date. After I left the facility and had time to think through that appointment, my antennae were wiggling
<strong>
<em>
WRONG
</em>
</strong>
! I listened to that little voice inside and canceled that surgery, telling them no one in that clinic would ever touch me again. Now you know the rest of the story.

Yeah they&#39;ll pull upward after a while, and some people have em fuse, that&#39;s typical and not really dangerous. Main complication to worry about with things migrating is the nylon ligature clips, but idk if your surgeon used those or just went with silk suture ligation since the clips are universally hated.

I didn&#39;t realize that. Yeah it&#39;s pulling the middle right almost completely up into the canal. Folds oddly and doesn&#39;t feel terribly pleasant.

Well, if it&#39;s not totally fused yet but the cord is healing, I&#39;d honestly just try pulling on the scrotum gently and see if you can un-stick it if it&#39;s trying to yank things up the inguinal canals, they&#39;re not supposed to do that but the ligatures should still be in place and everything else already healed, so no real risk involved, just probably stuck somewhere it shouldn&#39;t.

Yeah there&#39;s no moving it, but now it&#39;s looking like the left side is actually the same but not pulling like this so it didn&#39;t seem similar at first. The side pulling is still swollen too. I can literally feel the cord up near where others have them extracted in that other way (not through the scrotum)
</p>
<p>
I hope it stops being painful soon. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
