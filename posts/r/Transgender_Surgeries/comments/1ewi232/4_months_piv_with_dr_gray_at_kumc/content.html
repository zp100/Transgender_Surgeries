Wow, she looks pretty ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° . Congratulations. Iâ€™m considering KU since Iâ€™m just 20 mins away. How was the experience and how much did you pay after insurance?

I had a great experience at KU! Dr Gray is super nice. Had a minor revision earlier this month and it went very smooth.

I have pretty good insurance, and I owed $4k after insurance. Should have my taco all paid off by next summer :)
