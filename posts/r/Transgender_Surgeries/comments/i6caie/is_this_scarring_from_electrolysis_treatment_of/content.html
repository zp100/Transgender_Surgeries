Yes.
</p>
<p>
I recommend you (and everyone, frankly) avoid thermolysis. Blend may be slower, but will be faster in the end due to increased efficacy -- in addition to sparing your skin.
</p>
<p>
To repair the pitting I recommend microneedling with a pen at home or if you have a large budget try fractionated CO2 laser.
</p>
<p>
Sorry this happened to you. It&#39;s very common and unfortunately most common wisdom about electrolysis is cargo cult.

2 types of electrolysis. Blend and Thermolisys ... Blend say takes 10 seconds a hair to kill as opposed to 1 second. However is better for the skin and takes about 2 or so cycles to kill the hair, Thermo takes 5 or so.
</p>
<p>
I had pale skin too, my first Electrolysist was pitting my face so I left and found another because I didn’t feel like discussing it with her because she was cocky ... found another one and been super happy. They both used blend method.
</p>
<p>
The pitting went away in 6 months. To hurry the process use micro needling, a good moisturizer and/or  an ipl device if you want to buy a cheap one just for this.

Try this.

</p>
<p>
You can also use a roller. Rollers cost about 20bucks. Pens about 120. Google micro needling or vampire facial. Lots of blood so don’t be squemenish...
</p>
<p>
It’s a common practice to get rid of acne scars or wrinkles. I can attest it works over time. Now 40 I had many acne pop marks and have seen great results using this technique at home. It works by breaking up scar tissue and making tiny cuts in the skin. Which heal completely and essentially make new skin and enhance collagen production. Lots of research if you look on google. S

Simple answer... yes it hurts but transitioning later in life and having a 90% gray beard. I have no choice. I have had several laser sessions to kill the few dark ones and it was quick, painful and kind of worked. Even with its reduced results it’s still far cheaper than doing electrolyis. Given the choice I’d go laser 100% of the time. If your blonde, red or gray your screwed like me. In the US I’d expect to pay about 3k for 10 facial laser treatments. I expect to spend 100 to 300 hours in electrolysis. I’ve seen prices from 75 an hour to 150 an hour. Ouch.
</p>
<p>
Pain wise I take 4 Advil, two tynonal and use numbing cream and I would describe the pain as minor. Like being whacked with a rubber band almost. No big deal but you do feel it.
</p>
<p>
You do get use to it and build up a tolorance to the pain over time. If I were anyone here not knowing I would just do it. You won’t regret it. Hope that helps.

Hi from another locked down Melbournian. I hope you&#39;re coping ok?! I&#39;ve been looking into electrolysis (after numerous laser sessions) but I hear it&#39;s expensive, painful and time consuming.

Yes going ok thanks , going a bit stir crazy though . I’ve had two sessions of laser on whole body , I wasn’t that hairy anyway but has worked well so far . Face hair is coming back but not as strong etc , I was supposed to have my 3 rd session this week but not happening now .  How much does the electrolysis cost ?

Tbh im not sure how much it is. I&#39;ve only heard that it&#39;s quite expensive compared to laser treatment. But obviously it will remove hair that laser can&#39;t.

Not no expert but many say: laser as much as possible and then finish with electrolisis if needed as  it is payed per time/hair.

There are two different types of pain involved. The first pretty much everyone has to deal with, the second is more common for those with thicker, coarser hair starting out.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;probe&#34; is needle thin and inserted into your follicle. It&#39;s not a sharp needle, but it&#39;s a needle nonetheless, and for myself it hurts worse the closer to my mouth. It feels sharp around my mouth, but more of a burning sensation on my cheeks/neck/jaw. The pain is immediate but once the probe is removed the swelling pain begins and the sharpness of it goes away. But, you&#39;re getting more than one hair done, so it really does feel like getting poked with a needle over and over again. The skin is pretty raw afterwards.
</p>
<p>
The second kind of pain happens when the hair is a lot thicker, so you feel the pain of the hair being pulled out of the follicle like it was being plucked. I mostly notice this on my neck, and it hurts, but it&#39;s more tolerable than the stabby around the mouth, and as the hairs thin out it stops occurring further into your treatment progress.

That is not my experience at all. Zero pain for the pull out. If it’s done properly the hair should just slide out. Also the needle going in shouldn’t hurt since it’s smaller than the hair. The only pain for me is during the zapping. Also my skin is fine in an hour and I usually get multiple hours of zapping at a time. The first person I saw was waaaayyyy more painful cause some pitting and scabbing. This led me to look for a second opinion and I’m glad I did. The woman I found is wonderful and a total pro. Btw. More pain and redness doesn’t equal faster kills. Sounds like you need a second opinion... just sayin....

I ended up with some areas like that from a bad electrolysis tech. It healed fine eventually but was rough and felt like I&#39;d just been punched in the face for a while. I did not go back to that tech.

I think when you have a really skilled electrologist you can&#39;t really say &#34;blend is better than thermolysis and thermolysis is bad&#34;. My electrologist is really one of the best here in Germany. She has nearly 20 years of experience, she also teaches others and also renews her CPE licence every 5 years. I have never seen someone so passionate about her work and also never someone as perfectly working. She always gets the cases where people had 80h of electrolysis done without any success. She then clears those faces in around 40h.
</p>
<p>
My face is nearly cleared after 30h. I had medium facial hair. The most what is left are some fine white hairs.
</p>
<p>
She uses thermolysis. I don&#39;t have any scars or other permanent skin problems (besides the normal swelling for some days after).
</p>
<p>
So I think it depends on the situation and your electrologist!

I&#39;m sorry that this happend to you. I would recommend reading

I&#39;m not associated with Susan in any way and I never met her. But what she is talking about makes total sense.

Most electrologists totally gaslight her, but everything about electrolysis on that site checks out with my experience. Her comments about laser are bs tho.

Unfortunately yes, because have a lot of those from my sessions, and i stopped immediately Because those scaring will take very long and some skin care routine to really get rid of. It has been a bit over a year for me and unfortunately those scarings are now my new hyperpigmentations......
