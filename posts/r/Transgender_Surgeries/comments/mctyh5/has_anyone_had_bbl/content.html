I&#39;ve had absolute disaster you need to see the negative reviews on Realself - Insta stars now telling stories of photoshopped results, and fixed competitions to make sure they win and free holidays. I had butt implants and fat transfer which had devestated my life and causes problems even now over 3 years later - feel free to contact me for more

He&#39;ll try to convince you that you need butt implants - whatever else you do DO NOT have butt implants

Butt implants are badmnews.  The BBL is good, but you may need more than one.  I hope to get round two this summer.

Are you suggesting multiple rounds of fat transfer?

I wouldn’t recommend him you can see from his results that he lowers the natural waist line to the same level of the belly button or below, everyone has a natural waistline above your belly button when you lower it it makes your torso look longer and makes you look more top heavy. Also he dosent give much hips he mainly gives lats which look really fake and give that tooth look. Turkey gets a bad rep but I’m going to dr Beyhan in July I’ve spoken to girls who have went to him and his results are good and they have all said he is professional and will always respond to any questions after you have came home. A few girls also said that he told them he didn’t need extra things like arm lipo ect. Feel free to give me a message

Whatever you do avoid Dr._Aslani I&#39;ve literally just seen a picture he&#39;s retouched on his website to make a patients results look better and to cover up her problems he&#39;s caused
