Nothing here sounds good. You really should be dilating every single day at this point I believe. I hope youâ€™re not skipping sessions. If youâ€™re getting a fever itâ€™s not related to dilating, and you need to call your doctor immediately. Failure to stick to your regimen can cause severe, permanent problems. Fever can be a warning of a serious problem.

Hi sister! Are you sure its actual fever? Are you checking your temperature or just feeling chills and shivers after dilation? I experienced this feeling when my srs and it was because of the intense pain i felt when dilating my body was in so much stress, but easnt actual fever per se. In any case, you should let your doctor know in case something more severe is happening undercovers. Keep on dilating!

Fever and chills could be signs of infection. Please reach out to your surgeon!

When I was 13 days post op. I was laying down to dilate. I went to insert half way through I started to see blood as I was leaning forward to look in the mirror I being to spaz and started to see stars. I then begin to go unconscious and the room turn dark red- I yell for my spouse and he came and saw me laying there twitching. I manage to get my dilator out.  After all passed (about 5 minutes) I got up and then I got chills and became very cold shivering. I got a fever for 4 hours and off.  I did not dilate I went to bed. The next day it was like nothing happened.

Take your temp make sure it&#39;s a fever not hot flashes or something like that.  I ended up in hospital for 2 days with urosepsis.

Check with your doctor / surgeon. Not a good idea skipping dilation, but once again get medical advice. You may be also experiencing a bit of withdrawl from estrogen if you had to stop a length of time before surgery.

I nearly fainted during rapid onset feverish hotness about 3 times in the weeks following post op.  Told the nurses and they said - oh youâ€™re experiencing symptoms of menopause (off of the lack of hormones)!! Since I was on patches, they told me it was safe to resume immediately.  Iâ€™m certain the solution is different for other hormone methods.  Once again - ask your doctor / surgeon.

<p>
Best wishes girl.  Youâ€™ll be okay! ðŸŒºðŸŒ¸ðŸŒŸ
