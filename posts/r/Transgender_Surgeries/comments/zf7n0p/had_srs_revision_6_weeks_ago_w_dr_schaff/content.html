Back in Oct 21, I had my initial SRS with Dr. Schaff at Berlin.
</p>
<p>
In general, the doctor does the surgery in two parts, thus having a revision isn&#39;t unexpected in my case.
</p>
<p>
In germany, we call the used technic
<em>
combined method
</em>
, but that&#39;s just fancy words for PI with a touch of thai technic. Some girls already explained it in their respective posts for german doctors, so I wont go into detail.
</p>
<h1>
Complains after first Surgery
</h1>
<p>
After my first surgery, I had some minor complains that as it seems are common for Dr. Schaff.
</p>
<p>
I guess, that&#39;s the part where future schaff girls might wanna take notes because everyone I know had at least the following concerns adressed during revision:
</p>
<h1>
Dog ears
</h1>
<p>
So basically the upper parts of the outer labias look a bit... funny and to be fair, dog ears on a cat just sounds wrong. But luckily this issue got resolved and the excessive skin made it a bit easier to opt for minor aesthetic preferences.
</p>
<h1>
erectile tissue
</h1>
<p>
In general, he keeps too much erectile tissue after the first surgery which can result in not just a tight vaginal canal, but also (at least in my case) decrease in blood flow to parts like the clitoris. Consequently, I lost sensation in my clitoris during arousal, which is quite the opposite of the intended effect. However with 6 weeks gone by, I also resolved that issue and can feel pleasure just as intended. As a side effect, my vaginal tunnel also widened at the entry, making piv intercouse and dilating in general a much more pleasent experience.
</p>
<p>
Besides these two points, I had no issues after the first surgery and have none left after the revision.
</p>
<h1>
Would I recommend Dr. Schaff?
</h1>
<p>
Honestly, not really. 5 years ago? Absolutely. He is a great doctor, but he is also old and his time is slowly reaching it&#39;s end.
</p>
<p>
The positive about him are his consistently good results, his experience and relatively short waiting lists in comparison to public hospitals.
</p>
<p>
However, Dr. Schaff is expensive (~33.000â‚¬) and almost certainly this will not be fully-covered by insurance. I had to pay 14.000â‚¬. Further, the clinic is really chaotic and it took 4 days to get a single doctor to my bed to even ask how the surgery went. The service really took a hit for the worse between my first and second surgery. Also, the bedside manners of Dr. Schaff are horrible. I know, some complain about him being transphobe, but thats not even it. He is old, like really old and it shows and will show even more. I am scared that at some point he will do major mistakes during surgery and that is why I am happy I finished my SRS journey.
</p>
<p>
Side note: I am really confused, how a privat clinic hasn&#39;t yet been able to buy a gyn table for post-op care. They have a stupid empty room with a single weight bench in the middle. Like, imagine being freshly post op and having to climb on that and put the feet on the two bars for the doctor to
<em>
have a look
</em>
. Insanity.
</p>
<h1>
Am I happy with my results?
</h1>
<p>
Absolutely, and so is my boyfriend.

I wish you the best of results and wish you an easy recovery period :* I totally think that the doctors in munich will be the future for the combined method, so you did everything right with your choice :)
</p>
<p>
I most likely wont post pictures of my result as I think this is a bondary I dont feel comfortable surpassing. Sorry ðŸ™ˆ

I don&#39;t know how deep translates exactly and I lost 2-3cm during recovery, so take it with a grain of salt.
</p>
<p>
I am roughly 12cm in depth atm and was like 14-15 pre op.
</p>
<p>
I heard doctors can use other material in case of not enough material to with.

I had surgery with him but I wouldn&#39;t call it PI because the shaft isn&#39;t being inverted any more it&#39;s all used for the Labia. The vagina is made from scrotal tissue.
</p>
<p>
The comment about the table made me laugh I remember that table !

Yeah, you are right. It&#39;s not really PI, so I tried to describe it as PI with thai flavor. But I dont have lots of knowledge about that stuff anyway.
</p>
<p>
Yeah. That table. Whats up with it ðŸ˜†

True ðŸ™ˆ Doctors are just starring awkwardly while I have to figure out how to hang it up because I have to somehow put it up, then sort out my legs with the bag and stuff.
</p>
<p>
Good times... not. It felt like shit being barely post op ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

Thank you for posting about your experience! I&#39;m scheduled for my revision in less than one week and had exactly the same issues after my first OP.
</p>
<p>
How was the recovery after the revision? How long until you were back on your feet?

Hey. I wish you the best of luck.
</p>
<p>
My recovery was pretty fast. I was able to have a somewhat normal day after just one week and basically no issues commuting after 2 weeks.
