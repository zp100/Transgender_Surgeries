<p>
This post is a continuation of my experiences with a peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty from Dr. Heidi Wittenberg March 9th 2021.  My part 2 post exceeded the max number of images so I&#39;m starting part 3.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
6-9-21 update (evening after 3-month post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Post-op with Doctor Wittenberg happened today at 8:30am. I was distressed to learn that most people are walking normally after about two weeks of healing. The doctor suggested I walk more often and walk with my legs together even though it hurts a bit. She also said I could go to pelvic physical therapy.
</p>
<p>
She confirmed I&#39;m healing &#34;a bit slower than average&#34; but also said I was healing really nicely.  She said some people she&#39;s used the new method of labia minora on have had the bottom ends of the labia slide upwards during healing but that didn&#39;t happen for me.  Kinda scary though.
</p>
<p>
She tugged at all the sutures she could see and some of them came out but it was hard to tell how many.  It didn&#39;t hurt much but I&#39;d also taken two oxycodone just in case.  She also used a speculum to look inside which I was surprised to hardly feel.  She said it would be cold but I didn&#39;t notice that.
</p>
<p>
She confirmed the greyish round flesh in my photos is the clit.  The little bit of redder tissue above it is granulation.  I also have granulation around the entrance to vaginal canal and about halfway into the canal.  She feels it&#39;s all minor enough to be treated with steroid cream instead of silver nitrate, so I&#39;m to put a bit of cream on the tip of the dilator once a day and push it in when I dilate.  I can also rub the cream on the spot above my clit.  She said the bumpy/ridgy swollen look of tissue around canal should eventually clear up.
</p>
<p>
She said the clit is constructed from the top third of the glans and it&#39;s two pieces sewn together which is what creates the jagged line down the middle.  I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s done this way but she said it should smooth out in time.
</p>
<p>
I asked a lot of other questions and got a lot of answers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The hairs pushed inside after I shaved will work themselves out eventually and won&#39;t cause problems.  I only saw a couple hairs on my next dilation and one or two others on the next two dilations.
</li>
<li>
The white bits along the labia sutures are &#34;surgical staples&#34; and will disintegrate eventually.  They still look like dead skin to me.Where is granulation?
</li>
<li>
I can safely submerge in water.
</li>
<li>
Normally you can drop to dilating once per day at this point but I need to keep dilating 2-3 times per day till it isn&#39;t so tight.  Argh.
</li>
<li>
I can stop hydrogen peroxide after peeing.
</li>
<li>
I should still keep my hands relatively clean before touching myself.
</li>
<li>
I can masturbate, including with a vibrator.
</li>
<li>
I can have sex if I&#39;m stretched enough for my partner (which I&#39;m definitely not unless I meet someone with a micropenis).
</li>
<li>
I can have genital laser hair removal or electrolysis.
</li>
<li>
My belly scars are healing well.  I have photos but they&#39;re at home so will have to edit them in later.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After the session we went and walked around Fisherman&#39;s Wharf for a couple hours and I practiced walking as normally as I could. It hurt for the first five minutes or so and then the soreness would come and go. After 3 months of walking like humpty dumpty it was hard not to slip into that gait that keeps my inner thighs from rubbing too much whenever I didn&#39;t think about it, but I think I managed something close to normal walking over half the time.
</p>
<p>
When we got back to the car I was surprised to find my feet hurt a lot (hard sandals didn&#39;t help) but my groin felt fairly ok.  I put ice on it just in case and we rested in the car for an hour or more.  Then we went to Japantown and I walked more.  After 20 mins I went to the bathroom and was disturbed to see more brown gunk on my panty liners than I&#39;ve ever seen.  I suspect it&#39;s blood-stained lube.
</p>
<p>
After another ~1.5 hours of walking I was feeling groin pain more often, my feet hurt, and I was overheated.  I went back to the car and now my groin was noticeably sore but not too bad.  I switched from panty liners to a pad under a blanket in the car.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t dilate again till 9:30pm.  I tried a new lubricant that&#39;s a bit less thick than KY jelly and I was pleased when the dilators didn&#39;t seem to have and blood on them but I think the new lube wasn&#39;t trapping the blood like KY does.  When I was washing it off (it washed off much more easily) I could feel about 2/3 of the sutures in perineum were now missing.  After showering I took a photo to confirm how many sutures had been removed:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/fhq4jys48e471.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917b1b59c36c924a6f55e71d8b379e64923b724d">https://preview.redd.it/fhq4jys48e471.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917b1b59c36c924a6f55e71d8b379e64923b724d</a>
</p>
<p>
I was surprised to see the red water drooling down and all the red inside.  I don&#39;t like it when the red water comes out...  So I think I bled significantly from the dilation and just couldn&#39;t see the blood in the new lube.  *sigh*  There&#39;s also blood up towards the top of the hood but I don&#39;t know why.  Maybe she removed a suture there?  I see a few missing sutures at the bottom and what looks like wounds around sutures that wouldn&#39;t come out.  So that&#39;s annoying...  But I&#39;m glad to have at least some of them out.  I still really want to know why I&#39;m bleeding so much, if the speculum hurt me or if it&#39;s caused by walking more normally or what.
</p>
<p>
After showering after my dilation I noticed I was walking pretty normally with no real pain.  So it seems like all my activity today improved things, at least so far.  My FFS surgeon told me in one of the post ops not to avoid moving in ways that caused minor pain because you have to move things through their normal range of motion to make them heal.  I imagine the same is true for walking normally and for sitting after bottom surgery.  So I probably slowed my recovery by never siting and by walking so guardedly but I also think ignoring pain to try to sit or walk normally after only two weeks could easily cause problems like wound separation or the labia minora pulling out of place.  Walking with thighs together causes a lot of things to rub together in the kitty and that rubbing is even worse when things are more swollen.  So I don&#39;t regret being careful but I probably should have stared with at least short periods of normal-ish walking at least a month ago.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope this bleeding thing quiets down quickly and that I can walk again tomorrow for more sight seeing with even less pain.

6-15-21 update (14 weeks, 3.2 months post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/hx950t6c1h571.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f438ceec9ae7f6a8b0f554733148e1e9aa3e9220">https://preview.redd.it/hx950t6c1h571.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f438ceec9ae7f6a8b0f554733148e1e9aa3e9220</a>
</p>
<p>
Swelling is way down the last 5 days and when I shower, it&#39;s much easier to spread labia majora to wash between.  The top of labia minora have flattened enormously and spread wider since a week ago.  I think the sutures that were holding them in place have let go so now I worry they might lose definition entirely over time.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/901y51jt1h571.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00294ce09f155d56f22ee17fce3f245604ac1ce5">https://preview.redd.it/901y51jt1h571.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00294ce09f155d56f22ee17fce3f245604ac1ce5</a>
</p>
<p>
The bleeding I had after the post-op resolved itself and did not return.  In fact, my pads show I&#39;m not leaking any brown gunk most days while I used to leak it significantly almost every day.  I&#39;m not sure what changed so suddenly but my best guess is brown gunk was scab material and whatever injury/injuries were leaking it have finally closed completely.
</p>
<p>
The evening after post-op I had a few small blobs of weird gunk on my dilator that looked like light brown poop. That only happened once but I also had smaller blobs that looked like green-white snot and those continue to plague me.  It wasn&#39;t just on my dilator but also stuck in random places like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/n4aasesh7h571.png?width=1011&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d22384dc931159ec5ae64ce5b6de7a2dfb43e55">https://preview.redd.it/n4aasesh7h571.png?width=1011&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d22384dc931159ec5ae64ce5b6de7a2dfb43e55</a>
</p>
<p>
I had more snot the next two days but less each time.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s pus because it&#39;s too gelatinous.  I never had anything like it before the post-op so I wonder if it&#39;s the lubricant they used congealing.  I also tried my own new lube one time before it appeared so it could be that, too.  I was ready to stop worrying about it till it appeared on my dilator again last night:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/70qu3kga8h571.png?width=2083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2e4b4a8162c7823fdd15a1e724bb8195be840d">https://preview.redd.it/70qu3kga8h571.png?width=2083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2e4b4a8162c7823fdd15a1e724bb8195be840d</a>
</p>
<p>
Argh.  I haven&#39;t felt any fever or pain and it doesn&#39;t stink so if it is a form of pus hopefully it will clear up.
</p>
<p>
The reduction in swelling and brown gunk discharge is rather surprising given that I&#39;ve put my kitty through a lot more abuse than usual the last week.  4-5 hours of walking with legs together 6 days ago, 2-3 hours 5 days ago, 10 hours on curvy roads 4 days ago (laying in back of car) + some walking.
</p>
<p>
That evening I slept on my side for the first time.   I had two pillows between my knees and my top leg shifted forward a bit to keep me balanced on my side with my foot in the air. It hurt significantly for a few mins and then quieted down. I managed to fall asleep but am not sure how long I was asleep - probably an hour or less. At some point I woke and it hurt enough that I shifted to my back. Pain faded with no lasting effects.
</p>
<p>
Three days ago I sat on a slightly padded chair with a lightly inflated donut cushion while eating breakfast at my parents. It hurt for about 10 mins then quieted down. When I got up about 30 mins later it hurt more but quieted after another few mins.
</p>
<p>
Then I drove my car for ~10 mins with the donut cushion. It didn&#39;t hurt as much as the chair and       quieted after a couple mins. Didn&#39;t hurt much after I got up.
</p>
<p>
Back at home I used the &#34;front&#34; spray on the bidet for the first time. It sprayed a little harder       than I wanted but didn&#39;t hurt.
</p>
<p>
When I finished dilating that eve, I decided to try a new vibrator I picked up in SF. It felt quite nice above my clit and later on my clit. Eventually, I turned off vibration and used it to rub and that felt nicer in some ways.  I tried pushing it into my vaginal canal but couldn&#39;t get it more than half an inch and it tended to cause pain. The vibe is a little thinner than the purple dilator but being aroused makes the canal tighter so it wouldn&#39;t fit. I wouldn&#39;t say the minimal penetration I could get with it ever really felt good.  Achieving orgasm with prostate stimulation is supposed to be the easier method early on but I couldn&#39;t touch that.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I used my index finger to touch my clit for the first time. It felt nice but was not very sensitive. It was fairly soft and felt smaller than it looks in the pictures. I think I also felt the granular tissue above it as a small firm lump but it didn&#39;t hurt to touch.
</p>
<p>
I spent about an hour and got vaguely close to climax a few times but never reached it.  This is expected - clitoral orgasm is not usually possible before 6+ months (or was it 9+?  I can&#39;t remember what Dr. Wittenberg said).  It was still enjoyable and when I gave up I felt somewhat sated like my body had had enough.  I haven&#39;t had the urge to try again yet.
</p>
<p>
I felt a little pain around my clit early on and then it went away and didn&#39;t return. Trying to get the       vibe in my vaginal canal led to a fair amount of blood but there wasn&#39;t obviously any coming from anywhere else.  When I finished I didn&#39;t notice any unusual pain or swelling anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Two nights ago I was able to sleep on my side with two pillows between knees for 2.5 hours.  Pain faded after a couple mins.  I woke because of pain in my shoulder but my loins felt fine.  Then last night I tried again and pain faded in 10-20 seconds.  I noticed my back hurt and tried reducing to only a single pillow between my knees.  That helped my back but my loins hurt significantly more.  It faded in a minute and I slept for 2:15 with not much pain in loins when I shifted to my back.
</p>
<p>
I only had time to dilate twice 6-9 through 6-12 and things have been quite annoyingly tight. There was a lot of blood 6-9, a little 6-10, but nothing detectable 6-11 or 6-12.  The next two days I had a little blood off and on.  Dilation didn&#39;t get any easier until this morning and I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s because I finally got in three dilations yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I finally got the steroid cream prescribed to treat the granulation tissue.  I put a tiny bit on dry dilator tip and squatted over the corner of my bed where I set a light and the mirror, then applied cream directly to spot above clit. It doesn&#39;t smear easily and left a blob on the dilator but I hope enough stuck where it was meant to go.  Added a bit more and applied to vaginal entrance. Then added lubricant and pushed dilator in to around where I think there&#39;s internal granulation.Pulled out, added more cream, pushed back in and dilated normally.  I&#39;m supposed to do this once per day before bed.
</p>
<p>
My urgent need to pee has been rare the last couple weeks and I was surprised to go many hours during our trip without needing to pee. The first day after post op and fisherman&#39;s wharf I didn&#39;t pee till Japan town and even then my urge wasn&#39;t that great. The next day we drove to Muir Woods and I didn&#39;t pee till we returned to the hotel 5+ hours later.  But after we got home I drank a hard seltzer and had to pee hourly for many hours after that, so certain things still trigger me, but it was that way before the surgery too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
So things have improved surprisingly greatly since I started ignoring the pain to walk more normally, sit, or lay on my side
</strong>
.  I still don&#39;t think pain should be ignored for at least the first month, but I probably shouldn&#39;t have waited 13 weeks to start pushing myself.  Although I also had a lot of additional pain and swelling for 2 days when I pushed on things to shave at week 11, and I feel like I would have suffered worse if I&#39;d walked with legs together at that point, so maybe I needed to wait this long.  Either way, it&#39;s hard to break my habit of walking or standing with legs apart but when I force myself I find there is minimal discomfort and it tends to fade.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been in a much better mode with more energy and drive to get stuff done the last week or two.  I also gained about 10 lbs.  I think both these things are signs the majority of my healing is done.  In the weeks prior I was always surprised how much carbs and sugar I could eat without gaining weight but at this point I think the body doesn&#39;t need that to heal anymore and I need to be careful what I eat again.  Sad.
</p>
<p>
Also, I can&#39;t find the pics of belly scars I took a week ago.  They&#39;re currently covered in silicone tape so I can&#39;t take new pics till the tape wears off.  But I can say they didn&#39;t look all that different from the previous pics.  I keep thinking about using silicone tape on the labia scars and then feeling like it will cause too much stretching so I still haven&#39;t tried it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EDIT:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The evening after I wrote the update above I achieved my first orgasm!  After dilating, I pushed the vibrator into my canal before I was too aroused to make it too tight. I angled it down to press my prostate. This felt good but not as good as times I&#39;ve pushed on it with an anal toy.  Eventually I rubbed my clit with a finger and pushed the vibe deeper.  This reduced prostate stimulation but let me imagine it was a phallus as I pushed it slowly in and out.  I was very surprised to get it at least 6&#34; in, deeper than the purple dilator which is almost as thick, especially given that I couldn&#39;t get it in at all a few days ago when I was aroused.  I kept expecting it to hurt, especially as I contracted on it now and then, but pain was rare and brief.
</p>
<p>
I expected the climax to feel a bit like the &#34;pumping from a dry well&#34; sensation males get with after they&#39;ve cum enough times to run out of semen.  Instead it wasn&#39;t a pumping sensation at all but more like a trembling tightness and a pleasure intense enough to make it difficult not to cry out in pleasure.  I&#39;m still surprised how different it was to past orgasms and the scientific part of me wonders if the difference is caused by stimulating internal muscles, the complete lack of testosterone, a change of mindset, or what...
</p>
<p>
It lasted 10-20 seconds and took me 15-25 minutes to achieve.  As soon as the pleasure started, my clit pulled away from my finger, seeming to retreat almost beyond reach. I was holding the vibe in deep and I&#39;m not sure if my canal contracted much on it but I&#39;m guessing not since there was no blood on the vibe and no pain afterward.  I&#39;m really surprised given how tight it was last time I masturbated.  I even took a photo to confirm there was no blood.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;m quite happy to know my body still functions correctly, to know how good it can feel, and to know it can be done without injury.  Achievement unlocked!
</p>

6-22-21 update (15 weeks, 3.5 months post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After achieving two more orgasms, I think I misinterpreted the sensation of the clit pulling away from my finger.  What actually seems to happen is the muscle that normally pulls your penis upwards and makes it bounce will contract uncontrollably during orgasm.  Its contraction creates the sensation of the clit pulling away but it does not actually pull away.  That same contraction feels like where most of the pleasure comes from during orgasm.
</p>
<p>
I verified on my second orgasm that it took 25 mins to reach, while my third took 35-40 mins and wasn&#39;t as powerful.  I felt like the biggest difference was using a better fantasy for the first two so the mind definitely plays a strong role in reaching orgasm, especially when the body is still healing and physical senses are dulled.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes my clit did become more sensitive and rubbing it helped push towards orgasm but it wasn&#39;t consistent and I still feel I could hurt things if I rub it too hard or fast.  Things around it are still sore when I apply pressure to them.  What feels physically best is rubbing the vibe over my prostate but if I leave it there too long the sensation gets dulled so I have to keep moving things.
</p>
<p>
Each time I masturbate I feel like my channel get slicker shortly after I turn on the vibration and it just gets more slick the longer I go on.  Thus I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m making lubrication, and I took this photo after my last session showing the KY jelly has gotten a lot more liquid than usual and taken on a yellow tinge:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/da1d6b7mov671.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b1dd4def59388416fbf94b2a8e2635eb5fa716e">https://preview.redd.it/da1d6b7mov671.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b1dd4def59388416fbf94b2a8e2635eb5fa716e</a>
</p>
<p>
Transudate is supposed to be yellow so I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the culprit.  Seems like my body is producing it at a good rate.  Enough to keep things slick during penetration but not enough to be oozing out onto my panty liners.  In fact I&#39;m only changing my liners every few days at this point and I think I&#39;d be fine just letting the few fluids I produce get absorbed in the panty fabric.  Presumably more transudate is released by the pressure of penetration or maybe even due to getting aroused.  But I also think I released transudate when I left the purple dilator in an extra 10 mins trying to get it a bit deeper.  I wasn&#39;t aroused in that case but the dilator came out feeling extra slick and when I washed it, the lube rinsed off easily instead of leaving the slightly sticky residue pure KY jelly normally leaves.

<p>
8 days ago I started steroid cream on the vaginal canal and the red lump above the clit.  For the first 3-4 days this made the lump above clit leave a speck of blood on my towel when I dried after showering.  But that seems to have stopped and now the lump looks smaller and less red.  Lumps around vaginal canal entrance also look less red.  I haven&#39;t had any blood on my dilator or seen the green slime since my last update.
</p>
<p>
Scars and scabs continue to improve but I&#39;m getting nervous about how subtle the line between labia majora and minora is becoming.  Some internal sutures have clearly released and caused a lot of loss of definition.  And yet those sutures continue to cause minor pains and I can feel them poking out of the skin.  You can see the ones towards the bottom right tip of labia majora are still hanging on too.  I tried pulling one gently but it didn&#39;t break.  I tried pulling one next to the clit hood fairly hard and it just hurt but wouldn&#39;t release.  It then ached for a couple days so pulling that hard was a bad idea.
</p>
<p>
Here are all my belly scars as of today:

I&#39;m surprised how much I&#39;ve healed the last week.  I can lay on my side a few hours a night with one pillow between my knees and little discomfort.  I can put my knees together while standing with only a slight pressure felt at inner thighs, at least 75% less than I used to feel.  I was walking completely normally this morning with zero pain and no sensation of swollen pressure or soreness.  This normalcy isn&#39;t consistent - I still get sore and mild pain sometimes - but normalcy is becoming more common.  My biggest sources of pain are from sutures near perineum or from what feel like internal sutures at inner thighs.  My left labia majora also sometimes hurt a bit to touch, but not always.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I switched back to using panties and found I could walk with them pulled up snugly and a &#34;barely there&#34; liner against my groin.  There was mild discomfort sometimes but it was mostly fine.  The biggest issue was when I lay down and the tightness of the panties pulled things in mildly painful ways until I shifted them.  Sometimes they pull subtly while laying down so I don&#39;t notice a problem until I get up and find things are more sore than they should be.  So in bed I&#39;m starting to just leave them off more often which sometimes makes me feel dried out but that problem seems to be getting better too for some reason.
</p>
<p>
Wearing those panties I went out to eat for the first time since surgery and sat for over an hour on my donut cushion.  It didn&#39;t hurt much though I noticed I kept wanting to brace my elbows on the table to remove some pressure from my seat.  Sitting back hurt a bit more.  When I finally got up, my tail bone hurt enough to make me hobble a bit to the car but my loins felt almost fine.  Kinda ironic.  I think the donut puts more pressure on the tail bone but it&#39;s probably also lost some of its ability to be sat on after 4.5 months of not being sat on.  It continued to feel mildly sore when I lay in bed that evening but feels fine today.
</p>
<p>
Five days ago dilation got a bit easier and it&#39;s been getting slightly easier each day.  Getting it started is the most significant improvement while getting it deep hasn&#39;t eased off as much.  I&#39;ve found I can get it deep more quickly by closing my thighs farther.  This makes labia drag on the dilator but I found I can pull them away with my fingers as well as twist the dilator as I pull it out to get more lubricant on the labia. There&#39;s also significantly less pain in starting and the occasional pain I used to feel at the midpoint and at full depth has become quite rare.  I skipped my mid-day dilation yesterday and things didn&#39;t feel obviously tighter today so I&#39;m going to try reducing to twice per day again.  I now get the purple dilator down to just over 2 dots visible fairly consistently.
</p>
<p>
Four days ago I started progesterone again.  I haven&#39;t noticed any obvious changes in libido or other effects so far.  That same day I also discovered that
<strong>
the air initially released by squeezing the douche bag can help the tip slide in more easily
</strong>
.  Wish I&#39;d thought of that earlier.  I&#39;m douching twice a week at this point though based on the subtleness of the smell I suspect I could reduce to once per week.
</p>
<p>
An update on peeing:  Every once in awhile I pee straight down but usually it goes a little ways down one or the other butt cheek for part or all of the time.  I tried squatting over a public toilet instead of sitting on the seat and pee went everywhere, almost getting on the seat, but if I sit down fully it&#39;s not a problem.  So that&#39;s annoying and I doubt it will ever change given the shape of things.  The only way I can see pee going consistently straight down is if labia minora hang significantly lower than majora and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s likely in my case.  It think it may happen sometimes when I&#39;m sitting and I have my legs pressed together just right.  But I&#39;ve also gotten used to using the front spray of the bidet and then patting it dry with a dedicated towel so whatever minor mess the pee makes isn&#39;t a big deal.

</p>
<p>
Labia minora are really disappearing towards the top which is sad but not entirely surprising.  I hope they maintain some definition towards the middle but am not really counting on that, either.  Six days ago I added silicone tape along the entire labia majora scar lines.  It caused some extra pain which I tolerated, and then the lube from my evening dilation caused the tape to completely detach towards the bottom so I cut about half of it off.  You can see what remains of the tape on the left in the picture.  By the next evening, the tape that was on the right started causing consistent pain near its bottom end so I removed it entirely.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Swelling and redness of the granulation tissue continues to reduce.  I haven&#39;t had blood on the dilator in over two weeks despite pushing fairly hard.  Dilation got significantly easier so I reduced it to twice a day.  This made things slightly tighter but still not as bad as two weeks ago.  I continue to work the purple dilator to just under two dots visible and it sometimes hurts mildly to get it that deep.
</p>
<p>
When I pull out the orange dilator I run the purple one along it in parallel strokes to lubricate the purple one.  I also noticed lubricant keeps getting pushed up to the top of my slit as I dilate so I can run the tip of the purple down my slit to collect a lot of extra lube as well.  This may not be a good thing to do earlier in the healing process in case you&#39;re sweeping any bacteria onto the dilator tip but at this point I no longer have to worry about infection.
</p>
<p>
Since reducing dilation to twice a day I feel like I have a lot more time each day (even though it only frees up around an hour) and I&#39;ve been a lot more motivated to get work done.  At the same time I&#39;ve had a lot of urgent tasks and expenses piling up so that might be another part of how much work I&#39;ve been doing lately.
</p>
<p>
I think a couple more of the sutures towards the bottom have broken off or dulled and the two sticking out of the skin to the right of clit hood in the picture now feel like firm lumps instead of hard plastic points.  I&#39;m guessing the plastic broke off and left swelling around what remains to dissolve.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I can walk without noticing pain at all while other times it still hurts a bit till I&#39;ve walked for a couple mins.  3 days ago I went to a movie for the first time since surgery (and since covid was a thing) and sat in a soft, motorized recliner seat using my donut pillow without much discomfort.  Sometimes a spot on left labia scar would hurt and I&#39;d have to shift.
</p>
<p>
We went out for ice cream and when laying in the car on my side to eat it, I accidentally put my knees together without a pillow between them but it didn&#39;t hurt enough to notice so I stayed like that to finish eating.
</p>
<p>
We went to eat in a restaurant for the first time since surgery.  They had lightly padded metal chairs.  I used my donut at first and my groin wasn&#39;t bad but it was really hurting my tailbone so I removed the donut and that felt a little better on tailbone and I barely felt it on my groin. Most of my discomfort while eating was tailbone and rear butt cheeks but I didn&#39;t notice it too much. However, when I got up the pain in my tailbone was pretty bad and it was hard to fully stand up. I hobbled out to the waiting area and gradually recovered.  Tailbone was sore whenever I was on my back until the next day.
</p>
<p>
We went grocery shopping and I was on my feet for quite awhile without getting tired.  Even bagged all the groceries myself and was walking around normally most of the day with little discomfort.  What&#39;s more impressive about this is I forgot to take any pain killers the entire day, even in the morning.
</p>
<p>
I only had to pee once while we were out but it made a huge mess on the toilet seat, spraying in almost every direction because I was squatting over the seat.  Had to wipe it all down with TP when I was done.  Back at home I felt pee going everywhere again instead of picking a random direction and staying there like it usually does.   One time it was shooting forward enough to get on the toilet seat despite my sitting on the seat!  It got better over the next few days but is still more messy than it used to be.
</p>
<p>
I thought I was done with the green slime but yesterday it reappeared.  Wish I knew what caused it.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Today I tried squatting with my knees together and it hurt a lot more than laying with knees together.  Maybe something to do with how tendons or muscles are pulling things.  So I still have to spread my knees to squat which is quite unladylike.  But someday it will be good.
</p>
<p>
I continue to sleep on my side a lot with a pillow between knees but always wake up after 2+ hours with aching legs that feel like blood isn&#39;t circulating properly.  I think the pillow is putting pressure on blood vessels or something.  So I&#39;m going to try using a really small pillow or blanket between knees tonight.

</p>
<p>
It looks and feels like more of the sutures have broken off but they still seem to leave bumps that look like pimples and can hurt if you rub them wrong.
</p>
<p>
Redness and swelling of the granulation have reduced enough that I&#39;m not sure it can be called granulation anymore, but I&#39;m still applying steroids once per day.  I&#39;ll probably keep going till things look completely pink or till I stop seeing any improvement.  I did have one bit of bleeding yesterday when I left the purple dilator in extra long and got it down to just over one dot visible.  It didn&#39;t hurt but I probably pushed it too deep too quickly since I&#39;d previously rarely had it below 2.9 dots visible.
</p>
<p>
Dilation twice per day continues to be relatively easy.  Pain during insertion is mild or sometimes barely there.  Internal pain has grown rare.  Sometimes the last couple inches are a bit difficult, usually after I&#39;ve been doing a lot of walking or sitting.  The last couple days I&#39;ve gotten the purple dilator down to two dots visible fairly often but it usually takes extra time.
</p>
<p>
No green slime this week.   Six days ago I started sleeping on my side with just a thin blanket between my knees and sometimes I put one knee in front of the other so my thighs are pressed together more than they would be with knees touching.  It still tends to cause some mild soreness that fades after 1-5 mins.  Doing this instead of using the thick pillow between knees hast mostly eliminated the feeling of waking up with not enough blood in my legs.  I&#39;ve progressed to sleeping on my side 50-66% of most nights.
</p>
<p>
4 days ago I drove for about 80 minutes before I started feeling uncomfortable enough to let my SO drive, though I could have kept going if necessary.  My car seat doesn&#39;t seem to hurt my tail bone much but all the movement felt like it was tugging the sutures a bit after that much time.  After laying in back for ~20 mins I drove the remaining ~20 mins to home without much discomfort.  I drove for shorter periods over the next three days without much discomfort.  The most painful part tends to be when I get in or out of the car but it&#39;s not too bad.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday after doing a fair amount of driving I  balked at sitting in a movie theater with standard seats instead of recliners because it felt like it was hurting mildly the moment I sat down and I feared it would be a major problem after 2+ hours.  So we got a refund.
</p>
<p>
I tried some rubbing against a partner&#39;s phallus but it would always hit somewhere that felt sore so it was hard to enjoy it.  I definitely haven&#39;t stretched enough to allow them to enter me.  My libido has been pretty low this week except for one day that I didn&#39;t have time to do anything about it.
</p>
<p>
Overall I feel things are healed enough that I can do most of the things I used to do as long as I tolerate some discomfort along the way.  Sometimes I can do things normally with no soreness at all and other times the same things still hurt.  I do still get tired a lot faster than I used to but it&#39;s significantly better than it was a few weeks ago.  I&#39;ve stopped regular pain killers and only take them when I notice unusual soreness or plan to be in the car a long time, and even then I usually don&#39;t think to take them.  I&#39;ve been able to work for long periods and am sleeping well enough that I don&#39;t feel fatigued most days.

Thank you for the extensive advice.  However, I think you may have missed that I&#39;m 13 weeks post op so I&#39;m well beyond the point of the fluid disappearing within a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
But the large amount of discharge was a new thing since my visit to the doctor two days ago.  I did a couple more hours of walking today and ended up with very little discharge on my pad so my best guess is it was caused by the speculum the doctor used yesterday and/or an initial reaction to my first experience walking with my thighs closer together.

Sorry for the delay. Yes, I think that your assessment is probably right. I had a problem area that wouldn&#39;t heal after I had a seroma following surgery. The doctor was &#39;packing&#39; the wound with an absorbent gauze to steadily make it dry up and close/heal.
</p>
<p>
However, there were a few times she would dig around in there to the point it was uncomfortable. She said she was doing it on purpose to stimulate blood flow and accelerate healing. Perhaps that&#39;s what the doctor was doing with you also.

Thank you for the continued detailed updates! I have my surgery scheduled with her next year and I always look forward to seeing how things are healing for you. Especially since you got the newer technique for the labia and there’s not much long term data about that.

Congratulations on your surgery. Hope you heal well. Nurses there are the best especially the Filipino nurses. When you get up to walk, walk slowly and carefully. When you use the bathroom, sit slowly. I had terrible wound dehiscence which I attributed to unmindful walking and sitting.

I’m fairly certain the labia minora loss is due to the bolster and catheter. I lost the bottom 8th and hopefully after healing it’ll be fine. I also tore though hoping tear will close up and shrink. Though I almost lost more after the secondary catheter placement the pressure was cutting off the blood supply. I kept my legs spread wide until cath was removed and saved mine from further damage one girl was not so lucky. I lost the bottom 8th early on and I think it’s because the bolster keeps your legs closed to tight around the initial surgical catheter. I did notice with your vacu thing you had a lot more freedom then me and the bolster. Though she only offers that at St Francis and bolster is at any of her other hospitals. I’m on week 6

Erf.  I&#39;m sorry you had those complications.  The wound vac seems to encourage keeping legs spread and spread legs puts less pressure on everything (unless you spread really far).  I feel like the Mozaic staff should be recommending spread legs and walking with spread legs instead of trying to force a closed-leg gait too early.  It seems really likely to me that putting pressure on things before they&#39;ve healed significantly will cause all sorts of problems.  They recommend lots of other things to reduce pressure from swelling like icing and avoiding arousal.  But I remember being told (I forget by who) that it was fine to close my legs even when I was wearing the wound vac.  It hurt to do so so I didn&#39;t do it even though I was desperate to sleep on my side.  I never closed my legs more than briefly until after week 13.  It hurt to close them even then but I pushed through the pain and it&#39;s gotten much easier after a few days.  I&#39;m even starting to sleep on my side for short periods - 2.5 hours last night - but I still have two pillows between my knees.

Yeah luckily another patient told me to be cautious as she had lost half her labia minora the week before to which she believed was from the second catheter. Thankfully to her, I went home and saw after the the brief car ride that the second catheter was laying right on the minora dead center and squished between my legs and where it was laying turned  black and blue within the brief car ride. I laid the Catheter vertical and opened my legs and fortunately the color returned. With the bolster you can’t really open you legs much. I told Megan and she kindah just blew the issue off. honestly, I’m not the biggest fan of Megan. She said some pretty wonky stuff on my first visit with her that came off slightly transphobic, enough so that even my mother brought it up after the visit and my mom is far from an angel herself. I also couldn’t pee on the post op visit, so they gave me a second cath but they didn’t believe me that I had a very nervous bladder and anxiety. We had to have it removed a few day early because of pain from constantly peeing around it and not through it pretty much from the moment it was inserted on the post op visit. Megan let me stay for 45minutes the second visit because I was so sure that my anxiety was the issue, I finally peed once I stopped having anxiety attacks. Which was the issue the first time. Tbh the office care after surgery is severely lacking IMO which is said because Wittenberg herself is a caring doctor she is just never there. They just need better tact

Damn...  I only spoke to Megan briefly when she checked on me in the hospital during recovery, and she was the one who removed the wound vac in first post-op appt and answered questions though I didn&#39;t have many to ask at that point.  That post-op was a Monday and all my other post-ops were Weds and all had Dr. Wittenberg.  You have to get an appointment on a day she doesn&#39;t have rounds at one of the hospitals, so ask when you schedule your appointment for a day she&#39;ll be there.  You can also send a message via Hale or email and ask that she respond to it instead of other staff.
</p>
<p>
Either way I never had a problem with Megan but I also didn&#39;t have any real troubling questions for her to answer.  She never struck me as uncompassionate but perhaps not as patient/compassionate as Dr. Wittenberg.  She was careful about removing my wound vac and packing and seemed to care about my comfort.  Since she said something that offended you I encourage you to bring it up with her as I suspect it was a misunderstanding.  I&#39;m pretty good at reading people and didn&#39;t sense any bad intentions from her, nor do I think she would last at a clinic dedicated to trans people if she were truly transphobic.  If you still feel there was no misunderstanding, bring up the behavior with Dr. Wittenberg.
</p>
<p>
I was fortunate enough to be able to pee in the first post-op so didn&#39;t get a second catheter.  Although I then had to get up to pee constantly and sort of wished I DID get a second catheter...  but it sounds like there could have been complications from it.

Ohh no second catheter is terribly uncomfortable and irritating, 1000times worse then first. Megan’s comments weren’t enough for me to care, I’m just surprised she doesn’t have better tact with what she says. It more or less saying things similar to “now that you are a woman you’re gonnah have to do this...” when she was talking about peeing and cleaning. I don’t care that much. I’m used to cis people making oblivious tactless comments just unexpected coming from a facility that specifically works with trans women. It was shady, but I hear it all the time from cis women. Not sure if I was “offended” I didn’t say that. More annoyed. regardless, the wound vac is clearly superior in terms of initial healing stages. The bolster is deff a nightmare I’m glad I don’t have to relieve it. I’ll make sure to try and schedule with Wittenberg directly at the end of July when I go back. Didn’t know I had the option.

Since you talked about the loss of definition, do you regret getting the newer labia method or would you do it again given the choice? My surgery is next June so I’m paying very close attention to how the new method looks long term and I’m hoping she’ll perfect her technique by next year.

I don&#39;t regret my decision because if you look at her gallery of post-op photos of the old method, few of them maintain much definition.  So I doubt the old method is any more likely than the new one to maintain better definition.  The new method at least uses a different type of skin for labia minora which I think will provide a little bit of contrast and maybe some different sort of folding of the skin that will make minora look a bit different even if the groove between majora and minora is completely lost.  So I think the new method has at least those advantages but ultimately few patients will end up with cis-like results without a revision of some sort and even with a revision I don&#39;t know how good you can get because just holding a groove with sutures or glue is obviously not enough for most patients in the long run.  I don&#39;t know what else you can do other than maybe artificial fillers or fat transfer but you are just as likely to create a line of puffiness that still lacks a groove between it and majora.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t found many pictures from any doctor where minora definition is preserved after 6+ months so I&#39;m dubious that any technique is more than 5-30% successful.  Of course it&#39;s also quite hard to find anyone posting pics 6+ months post-op and not all doctors post a gallery of results.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has found evidence of a doctor using a more successful technique I&#39;d love to hear about it.

Thanks for the response! For the record I think that you have a great looking result. There’s one picture on her website with the new method that actually looks really ideal with a good ratio of majora to minora. I hope as the time goes on she gets more and more that look like that one. But even if my surgery looks exactly like yours I will be very happy 🥰 looking forward to future updates as always

I didn&#39;t mean to imply I&#39;m not happy with my result but I do worry the line between majora and minora may completely disappear in time.  What it looks like now vs 6 months from now could be quite different.  We&#39;ll see.
