Has anyone here had any experience with Dr Brielle Weinstein in Tampa? She is listed as the go-to surgeon for gender affirming facial surgery (among other gender affirming surgeries) at USF Health.

She absolutely is an INCREDIBLE surgeon and an absolute ball of sunshine. She recently moved back to Tampa, which blows for a lot of folks where moved from, but myself and several friends had her. I know many others were hopeful but it&#39;s just moving up in the world.
</p>
<p>
She will listen. She will check on you. She cares. A big plus is that she&#39;s very into what she does. It&#39;s a passion for her. She outlines everything, answers every question.
</p>
<p>
I wish I could get my friends on here to second all of this, but seriously she&#39;s damn good.
</p>
<p>
She previously practiced at Rush University Medical Center.
</p>
<p>
If you consult with her, you&#39;ll see what I mean.

Hey thanks. I didn’t think I would get any response to this. Do you know where I might be able to see some before and after photos of her work?

The only way I was able to see any, were those that patients signed releases for to be added to a pool at the hospital.
</p>
<p>
I would ask and see if she has any before/after photos. She might have some!
</p>
<p>
Even what I saw was minimal in numbers because 99% were going in and on to normal life (stealth) and don&#39;t want that sort of thing &#34;out there&#34; despite how restricted the access is.
</p>
<p>
With the number of people who had gone through her, it was sad that not many would be added for reference but I get it. I wouldn&#39;t concent either.
</p>
<p>
Give her office a call and set up a meeting. If you feel a good connection, that&#39;s a good step in the process of finding a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to DM but anything others searching her name might find useful can search and have it come up here.

I am not certain of the timeline at her current practice but if you give her a call, someone there can let you know what they are booking out to :)

Ok so the consult went amazingly well, she spends however long you need to answer ALL questions. I even asked about meta and she delved into her experience with that. I’m not 100% I’ll choose her for my top surgery as I’ve always wanted Garramone, but she did have some pics of results she’s done, and they look pretty good. Everyone on staff was amazing and I love that she’s local for the Tampa Bay Area!
</p>
<p>
She’s booked out until around August as of today, so not bad at all! I highly recommend seeing Brielle!

Thank all of you in this thread! I’ve been so nervous to give Dr Weinstein a call because I couldn’t see pictures or really anything on her outside her USF profile. Is there a specific number that goes directly to her practice/ team?

@anthony_JuR I didn’t get top surgery with Brielle. My heart has always been stuck on Dr Garramone! But I’ll tell you I’d be way more excited for any kind of bottom surgery with her! That really seems to be where she excels!

So I work in the OR with Brielle and am actually having a consult with her today. I can second what the first response said in that it’s literally a passion for her. The first time we really spoke it was in regard to top surgery for trans masc folks and she had hopes of starting a program back here in Tampa. That convo was over a year and a half ago and she’s now back in Tampa and is laying groundwork for that comprehensive program. I can let yall know how the consult goes.

Yup. As a scrub tech in a hospital where many surgeons work. The OP asked if anyone “had any experience” with her and I’m providing information in regards to their question. Not a vested interest, as I do not work FOR her.

Anybody know anything about her experience with bottom surgery? Have a consult with her in Dec, and I’m nervous about her because there isn’t much info online (save for her top surgeries for transmasculine clients)

Only what she’s told me. I have a consult with her in early Nov. last time I saw her she said that she had 5 bottom surgeries scheduled before November and would be able to share more photos and discuss complication rate.

It was great. She’s wonderful. I’m so glad that I’ve done the consultation. That said, she is still new at this compared to any number of surgeons. I so want to see more images and hear from former patients before I could schedule surgery.

Hi there! I’m actually a RN that works at the same hospital she commonly does surgeries at. I’m also MTF and had bottom surgery with her and Dr. Everett. Both amazingly sweet surgeons that did an amazing job. Very upfront and honest and I’m very happy with my results. We’re working with them to hopefully launch and get a transgender surgical program up and running for the TB area

She did my top surgery revision. She is an angel and advocated for me so much during the whole process. She took time out of her busy schedule to attend a meeting with insurance and advocate that the surgery was medically necessary. Great experience overall

Call USF Tampa and just let them know you want to schedule a consult with Dr Weinstein. You&#39;ll have to tell them what it&#39;s for,  so they can categorize it appropriately.  Be aware,  I scheduled my bottom surgery consult a month ago,  and my consult will be in June 2025. I&#39;m a little frustrated by the lack of info I can get ahead of time,  but it&#39;s good to read good reviews in here. In hoping I can get surgery within 3 months or so of the consult. I am nearly 4 years into transition and insurance issues prevented me from getting surgery over 1 year ago,  so I had to start all over in the process.
