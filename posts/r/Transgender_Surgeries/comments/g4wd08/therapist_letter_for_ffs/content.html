Re: [patient name on insurance card], [patient&#39;s chosen name], [patient DOB]
</p>
<p>
To Whom it May Concern,
</p>
<p>
[Patient name] is a patient in my care at [your practice name]. They have been a patient here since [date]. They identify as [gender identity] and go by [pronouns]. They note that they first knew their gender identity differed from their assigned sex at age [age]. They have socially transitioned by [list how -- changed name, pronouns, dress, make-up, hair, tuck, pack, binding, coming out, etc.). They have been successful and consistently living in a gender role congruent with their affirmed gender since ]date]. They have been consistently on hormone therapy since [date] (If contraindicated or chosen not to take hormones, state that here). Despite these interventions, they report significant anxiety, depression and distress due to their experience of dysphoria. By my independent evaluation of [patient name], I diagnosed them with Gender Dysphoria (ICD-10 F64.1). They have expressed a persistent desire for [types of surgery]. Their goals of surgery are [goals]. Surgery will address their gender dysphoria in these ways: [explain].
</p>
<p>
[Patient name] is psychologically stable to undergo this surgery. [list any mental health diagnoses that may be relevant to having surgery]. They are stably housed and have prepared for their post-op recovery [if this is true; if not, state plan for post-op recovery]. They have no issues with illicit drug use or abuse [if this is true; if not, explain plan of care for stabilization].
</p>
<p>
[Patient name] has more than met the WPATH criteria for [type of surgery].  I have explained the risks, benefits and alternatives of this surgery and believe they have an excellent understanding of them. [if risks, benefits and alternatives are unknown, please state they will be discussed at consult.] They can make an informed decision about undertaking surgery. I believe that the next appropriate step for them is to undergo [type of surgery], and I believe this will help them make significant progress in further treating their gender dysphoria. I am available for coordination of care and ongoing treatment as needed and welcome a phone call to establish this. Therefore, I hereby recommend and refer [patient name] to have this surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
[your name and credentials]
<br>
[your phone number]
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hope this helps.

Before you send it in, ask your surgeon and your insurance what they&#39;d like to see in the letter, every dumb place has their own things they demand, some don&#39;t really care, some want specific details

I thought insurance won’t cover it. Does a letter change things? I have Aetna and want to get ffs in the future, do you think they would cover it

I know most Blue Cross insurances do. Also if you work at Starbucks or Microsoft you can get it covered
