Had surgery with Dr Jun on thursday. Ive been taking single percocet tabs for the pain since and am supposed to be discharged from the hospital this morning.
</p>
<p>
I can answer any questions anyone has in the comments other than personal information, obviously. This is a throwaway account.

So happy for you. How painful is walking? Are you able to sit in a chair? If so how long?
</p>
<p>
Hope your recovery is smooth and rapid.

Walking is less painful than sitting or laying down! I can sit in a chair at this point as long as my pain meds are working, and for no longer than like 25 minutes. I use an inflatable donut pillow from cvs to help.

Thank you.  My recovery might be difficult then. I am looking at a 3 hour car ride at 7 days post op. If things go as current planned.
</p>
<p>
What was the plan for you? Two be in town Two days prior. Colon prep one day prior. Three days in hospital 4 days in town with first follow up on that 4th day post hospital release?

I was in town for 2 days beforehand and did bowel prep the day before - 3 days in the hospital and then my first post op appointment is on tuesday, so 5 days post op. Though, im staying in town until mod december, so that helps.
</p>
<p>
I had a 30 minute ride from the hospital to the air bnb - i probably couldve done longer if i absolutely had to but i would definitely need to take the percocet first. For a longer ride id probably try to get in the passenger seat and lay all the way back rather than sit in the back seat. I wouldve been able to do it then.

I had a friend that just completed the robotic peritoneal Flap vaginoplasty and she was in a lot of pain in the abdominal area for the first days are the surgery. She was screaming in pain when they gave her heparin shots. Also was screaming when they took the packing out and stitches in post-op 1; how was your experience for these these?
