So I’ve already gotten my SRS and I’m recovering now. I’ve been asked to share what I packed and what I learned through my journey to Thailand. It won’t be the most organized but you might find something useful out of this.
</p>
<p>
I way overpacked clothes. I went alone so I’ve basically camped out in my room and not done any touring, just trying to play it safe. If you do go sightseeing etc., bring an outfit for each day pre-op. If not, don’t. I would suggest only bringing one real outfit, for the consultation day. And then a comfy loose outfit for surgery day. Other than that you will be recovering in your room the rest of the time. I spent all of this time in nothing but panties. It’s hot in Thailand! And I’m alone, no reason to have clothes. They also have a laundry service so if you want, you can get them washed for cheap and it’ll cut down on packing space. Definitely do not over pack clothes like I did. Because you need way more space in your suitcase coming back for all the dilation supplies. (Would recommend stocking up on QC Jelly and Docaine cream because it will probably be more expensive in your home country.) This stuff takes up more space than you would probably think, so keep that in mind.
</p>
<p>
You will need a lot of pads (with the wings!) and definitely prepare. You will use about three a day if you don’t like sitting in your own blood like I don’t. I brought a pack of 30, and bought a pack of 20 when I arrived, and they give you a small pack with your post op kit as well. I will probably need to pick up a few more before I leave, too.
</p>
<p>
I brought bug spray and sunscreen but didn’t even glance at it. You won’t need it.
</p>
<p>
Tums and Gas-x saved my life. Really. The first 7 days post op you want to try to suppress bowel movements as much as you can because the packing is awful and the stitches will be very sore. Gas-x really helped and I found myself using it often to get through the day lol.
</p>
<p>
I tried grocery shopping to get some necessities. I honestly didn’t need most of what I bought. I just suggest getting a bed top desk, lots of water, maybe some noodles and soup, Gatorade, juice, and that’s about it. You can get this delivered with the HappyFresh app (very convenient! I just used the hotel phone number and they accept that, so everything gets delivered right to my door.) So save yourself the panic attack, because no one speaks English at the average grocery store and nothing has English labels. I was so lost and miserable. Use this app. I never used delivery services in America because they’re expensive. They’re not expensive here. I get food delivered to me daily using the Grab App and it’s delicious and quick every time.
</p>
<p>
That’s about all I can think of. If you have any questions let me know! :)

Yes I had surgery on May 14 and I have my follow up appointment on May 31 where I will see him and we will discuss my operation and he will clear me for for more traveling (hopefully)! But yes it is just the nurses until then! I keep in contact with chett’s team through email. (More meds, issues with my catheter, anything I’m nervous about, pain, etc.)

Does Som answer more than once a day after you had surgery and need to contact them? My surgery is on the 22nd, and while Som has been extremely helpful with my barrage of questions so far, she only responds once a day.

Nah it’s about once a day. Sometimes I would get two in a day. If I sent one in the morning and another one in the early afternoon, I would usually get two responses.

She has a job other than responding to emails. They’re quite busy over there. On top of being one of the best transgender surgery clinics in the world. I’m sure she gets countless emails, to which she must respond to in detail. Regardless you’ll get good care while you’re there!

Thanks. I am making my packing lists right now and this is extremely useful. Two questions: - How did you handle food? I would like to not get takeout every single time.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can you get some meds there - i.e. stuff against constipation, or pain-killers, or do you think its better to pack them from home...
</li>
</ul>

I don’t eat much. So I eat a fat breakfast and just get dinner delivered and that’s like $7 a day. But otherwise you can just get groceries delivered and stock up.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t, I got them in the US and I wouldn’t suggest getting them here because its hard to find what you’re looking for and labels are all in Thai lol.

Pain-killers might cause you problems at airport customs, and medication in general might be risky to mix with whatever else you&#39;re taking.
</p>
<p>
I suspect some of this is also specific to the surgeon.
