In case you are following along, you may have recognized the talking points that have been parroted by Dr. Erica, &#34;I&#39;m not anti-trans&#34; Anderson, formerly of USPATH and WPATH. The root of these talking points come from folks at
<a href="https://genspect.org/team/">https://genspect.org/team/
</a>
. You can read their bios and the organizations positions on Trans-youth, medical transitioning and informed consent. At first glance, if you can get past the name recognition they seem almost benign, but you don&#39;t have to dig very deep to discover they&#39;re primary mission is stopping people from medical transition including HRT and supporting those who desist or detrains. I clicked through some of their recommend resource links they provide and it didn&#39;t take but a moment before I was staring at anti-trans propaganda from The Family Research Council.
</p>
<p>
If you believe that cooler and wiser heads will prevail when it comes to minors accessing transition services under Florida&#39;s DOH Guidance, below, this is only a stop gap measure until the Florida House returns to session in 2023. At the rate, the people currently writing anti-trans screeds across the internet over Dr. Teetus Deletus, minors getting access transition care, and her never-ending marketing campaign targeting the youth on TikTok. And if this wasn&#39;t already enough sexualized drama to get attention, her sister, a partner in the practice, was/is a relationship with one of her patients. Ethical or not, it looks like a made-for-TV clown show. Dr. Gallagher has managed to provided our detractors with more than enough ammunition for Gov DeSantis to justify a Florida guidance document on
<em>
The
</em>
<em>
Treatment of Gender Dysphoria for Children and Adolescents
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of elements at work here including recent clamp down in Texas and Alabama. The Trans-Youth of Florida needed a serious trans ally. What they got was a high profile social media manipulator who has foolishly allowed herself to become the perfect weapon to use against them.
</p>
<p>
Anyone that was paying attention should have seen this coming a mile away.

Treatment of Gender Dysphoria for Children and Adolescents

<p>
<strong>
Mission:
</strong>
To protect, promote &amp; improve the health of all people in Florida through integrated state, county &amp; community efforts.
</p>

<strong>

<strong>
Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD State Surgeon General
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Vision:
</strong>
To be the Healthiest State in the Nation
</p>
<p>
The Florida Department of Health wants to clarify evidence recently cited on a fact sheet released by the US Department of Health and Human Services and provide guidance on treating gender dysphoria for children and adolescents.
</p>
<p>
Systematic reviews on hormonal treatment for young people show a trend of low-quality evidence, small sample sizes, and medium to high risk of bias. A paper published in the International Review of Psychiatry states that 80% of those seeking clinical care will lose their desire to identify with the non- birth sex. One review concludes that &#34;hormonal treatments for transgender adolescents can achieve their intended physical effects, but
<strong>
evidence regarding their psychosocial and cognitive impact is generally lacking.
</strong>
&#34;
</p>
<p>
According to the Merck Manual, “gender dysphoria is characterized by a strong, persistent cross- gender identification associated with anxiety, depression, irritability, and often a wish to live as a gender different from the one associated with the sex assigned at birth.
</p>
<p>
Due to the lack of conclusive evidence, and the potential for long-term, irreversible effects, the Department&#39;s guidelines are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Social gender transition should not be a treatment option for children or adolescents.
</li>
<li>
Anyone under 18 should not be prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.
</li>
<li>
Gender reassignment surgery should not be a treatment option for children or adolescents.
</li>
<li>
Based on the currently available evidence, &#34;encouraging mastectomy, ovariectomy, uterine extirpation, penile disablement, tracheal shave, the prescription of hormones which are out of line with the genetic make-up of the child, or puberty blockers, are all clinical practices which run an
<strong>
unacceptably high risk of doing harm.
</strong>
&#34;
</li>
<li>
Children and adolescents should be provided social support by peers and family and seek counseling from a licensed provider.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These guidelines do not apply to procedures or treatments for children or adolescents born with a genetically or biochemically verifiable disorder of sex development (DSD). These disorders include, but are not limited to, 46, XX DSD; 46, XY DSD; sex chromosome DSDs; XX or XY sex reversal; and ovotesticular disorder.
</p>
<p>
The Department’s guidelines are consistent with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services age requirement for surgical and non-surgical treatment. These guidelines are also in line with the guidance, reviews, and recommendations from Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom, and France.
</p>
<p>
Parents are encouraged to reach out to their child’s health care provider for more information.

Why are they recommending against social transition? How is it irreversible? Transphobia? Oh. Got it.

Persecution of trans youth. Hopefully real healthcare professionals look at this and reject it and call it out.

Texas did it first. Texas and Florida are in a competition to see who can fuck us over harder.

Sorry girls I hate both parties as they are way extreme.off the scale ..I read an interesting report from a gender counselor who herself is indeed transgender ..she is very alarmed by how the number of transgender children have increased ! She likens it from dc down through the schools pushing it in lime what she feels is a peer pressure move..I feel it is the parents not the school and not any party of govt should decide how best to care for their children

As reasonable as that sounds, have you ever seen a graph representing the number of left handed people from before it was &#34;acceptable&#34; to now?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://m.facebook.com/mygayday/photos/a.429019133870872/3566073526832068/">This shows the same phenomena that we are seeing with trans people
</a>
</p>
<p>
I will look for a more academic version... I can&#39;t remember where I found it before, but, it&#39;s the same idea. You &#34;beat the xyz&#34; out of a population for so many years, when population xyz begins shedding a stigma, it looks like an explosion. People try to say that it&#39;s an artificial rise, and maybe a little... but not to the degree suggested. I have felt trans since I can remember... and began coming out at 33, didn&#39;t transition till 36... does that mean I wouldn&#39;t have come out, or would have succeeded in coming out had I been treated at a you get age?
</p>
<p>
Let children explore their identity, medications don&#39;t begin till later, blockers do not do irreversible harm, and hrt doesn&#39;t need to be started till later either. Do we harm ALL trans kids to protect the 1% of those that come out that might change their mind? That&#39;s like saying we should sterilize ALL people in case they have children and regret it.

Who the hell puts themselves in a position of danger, ridicule, marginalization, and lifetime of being hated over peer pressure? Why do people think that trans people are out there PREACHING, going door to door trying to spread the &#34;good news&#34; that they may be trans too... wait, we don&#39;t have billboards saying that you&#39;re gonna go to hell unless you transition??? Thaaaats right, that&#39;s a religious thing. Please don&#39;t spread that... it&#39;s over exaggerated, outdated, phobic, and sets us back from all the gains we&#39;ve made....

I&#39;m not posting this to take a position and if I did, I&#39;d say your reflection on the issue seems reasonable. This should be something that involves the child, the parents and their healthcare providers. No other people need to be involved in decisions like this. With that said, it&#39;s a little difficult to coordinate the best care in all cases, if the State carelessly removes treatment protocols or outright criminalizes healthcare providers.
