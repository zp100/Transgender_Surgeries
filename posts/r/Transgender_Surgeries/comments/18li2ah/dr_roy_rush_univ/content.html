RUMC can not share that publicly. Hospitals operate less openly than clinics.
</p>
<p>
Roy took over for Weinstein and Dorafshar, and has a ton of experience.
</p>
<p>
To put it frankly, most who get these procedures, do not post about it or their pics for the sake of just being women (what some call stealth, I just not am a big fan of the term).
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s incredibly talented, she&#39;s contributed quite a lot in regards to many procedures. You can look her papers quite easily. She&#39;s a very talented craniofacial surgeon.
</p>
<p>
When you consult, RUMC any doctors who do this type of surgeries has a database of patients. This is where you get before and after from.
</p>
<p>
However.. Patients have to agree to this. You get asked, do you want to be part of this pool, that will ONLY be shared with people consulting. Majority decline.
</p>
<p>
But with the numbers RUMC sees, you might quite a bit of what you&#39;re looking for.
</p>
<p>
RUMC surgeons are detailed, they will spend hours discussing with you, they will answer your questions. Explain clearly what you&#39;re after, see if you also click with your surgeon. If you feel any sort of apprehension, many other options.

I’ll share that I literally just left a FFS consultation with her as we speak. I found her to be personable and enjoyed how she discussed her approach. I asked to see before and after photos, and she said that I could see them if I decided to move forward or if I scheduled a separate appointment to see them. I found this to be incredibly strange. I don’t think it’s indicative of her abilities, but it felt a bit dismissive.
</p>
<p>
I intend to schedule another appointment, because for the sake of due diligence I think that it will be worth it to see them. I am currently navigating consults with other providers as well though, so I am not putting all of my eggs in one basket.
</p>
<p>
Also… another weird thing. Her resident assistant initially told me that she usually does separate appointments for brow work (lifting w bossing and scalp advancement) and rhinoplasty work. Maybe there is some justification that makes sense… but why would I want two separate recoveries? When I asked Dr. Roy, she said that we could combine the procedures. Just was a strange suggestion/occurrence.

I clicked very well with dr tulsi and I have read her papers and am aware of some of her work and care already. I was not aware of the policy however thank you. That makes sense however. I do have confidence in her abilities. I just have anxiety and am more of a visual learner. Lol

Hi! Do you mind elaborating on your experience with this consult and surgery with Dr. Tulsi Roy?
</p>
<p>
If not surgery, could you share why you chose another surgeon? Thank you!
