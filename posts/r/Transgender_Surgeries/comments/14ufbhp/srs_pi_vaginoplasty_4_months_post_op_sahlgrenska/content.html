Overall, I think it has been healing nicely so far. Some of the scar tissue seems darker than the rest, I guess time will tell if it remains so. The tissue in the urethra remained granulated for quite some time, but as far as I can tell, it seems to have started to heal too.
</p>
<p>
Psychologically, the surgery has been rough on me. Anxiety, depression, fatigue and pretty severe stress symtoms. Lots of cramps in my lower abdomen/groin, trembling hands, cold feet, hot flashes, nausea, dizzyness, blurry vision, brain fog. Fell over once since I almost fainted and my legs suddenly gave out.
</p>
<p>
My main concern, however, is that I haven&#39;t been able to dilate as much as I have been ordinated to do. Dilating in itself no longer really hurts, usually it has been the cramps that have hurt too much, or just me being too depleted to even go through with one. I am slooowly trying to get back to do two one hour sessions each day. Lately, I have only been able to manage 1 one hour session daily.
</p>
<p>
With all that said, I&#39;m so happy and content with my surgery, and I don&#39;t regret it at all. I feel so happy about myself and my appearance, perhaps for the first time properly &lt;3

Not entirely sure what you are asking for? This is
<a href="https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/9eb2af8b-c616-43bd-a28d-47576ab9a38e">Dr. Selvaggi&#39;s profile
</a>
on University of Gothenburg&#39;s website. Dr. Jula was assistant surgeon during the surgery. As far as I can tell, he is a resident physician, training with Dr. Selvaggi.

I live in Sweden. Since my surgeon is not a private practioner, I doubt he performs surgeries outside the Swedish public health care system. But that&#39;s only afaik ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I still do not know for certain. When I have masturbated I have mostly stimulated the nerve cluster above the clitoris (I don&#39;t recall what it is called rn), and I haven&#39;t tried clitoral stimulation that much yet. The skin around it has been kinda thin still imo, so I have been pretty careful with it.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t tried penetrative sex or masturbation yet, so I can&#39;t tell how that feels for me either ü§î Both me and my partner want to remain cautious, so I don&#39;t end up damaging my vagina üòÖ
</p>
<p>
I do recommend going to Sahlgrenska, my experience with the surgeons, nurses and other medical staff has been positive üòÑüëç

Same here, unsurprisingly :V And umm, that depends on how you measure it I suppose ü§î I don&#39;t remember exactly when I was put on the waiting list, it must have been when I changed my personal id number and legal gender. I do remember having a consultation in 2019, so a doctor could check what needed to be done before the surgery (mostly how much hair needed to be removed with electrolysis).
</p>
<p>
So I would roughly say 5 years, but also say that part of that is due to COVID-19 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yeah that&#39;s the same issue I had. Would have been almost fully feminised by now if not for it. Waiting times in Sweden are usually only 6 months before you can finally get a diagnosis.

6 months before you get a diagnosis? Maybe if the year was still 2015 that may be the case but that‚Äôs far from the truth these days, it‚Äôs more like 46 months‚Ä¶

Hi! So I am a transwoman living close to gothenburg. I was wondering what kind of costs you had to pay for this and if you have any sensation and so on!

Iirc the surgery itself costed as much as a doctor&#39;s appointment, so 300 kr. Other than that, I payed 120 kr for each day I stayed in the hospital before and after the surgery. I stayed for a little more than a week.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is alright imo, I can climax through clitoral masturbation decently well. Sure it is not as easy as before, but the feeling is fantastic ü§©‚ú®Ô∏èüôà
