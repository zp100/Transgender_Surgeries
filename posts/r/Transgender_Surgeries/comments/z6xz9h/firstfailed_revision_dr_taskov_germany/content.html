Im not sure, I would guess that there&#39;s the risk to lose it and I&#39;m glad I kept my feelings/sensation there. I think it was reduced to make the clit hood possible? It&#39;s able to cover it now (after second revision )but not really a clithood, I think I actually never saw a real clithood at a neovagina

I have a natal vagina and it looks really close to this. The labia minora is perfect.  I hope that the revision and healing go well, regardless.

My natal parts look like this too. It looks great, I hope your healing continues to go well. I agree with other commenters that this is very much within the realm of natural diversity for natal vulvas. Nothing wrong at all with a prominent clit. Still I hope you can achieve the results you desire and as much comfort as possible.

Ty also for your kind word, it helps me a lot to know that I&#39;m not &#34;off&#34;, curious what you gonna say about my current state. The clit is still prominent and knowing that it&#39;s okay and doesn&#39;t have to be fully covered makes it possible to find my peace with my vulva. Actually from the conditions I had I think the result is good

I think the result is very good too, not that my opinion counts for anything. Please do share the results of your revision if you feel comfortable down the road. And thank you for sharing your experience. Best of luck with the healing process again.

Oh I&#39;m going to, I think I will wait until Wednesday when I&#39;m leaving the hospital. Your opinion seems honest and is appreciated. The healing process is almost done, It has been almost 1,5 weeks and I think it&#39;s soon to be totally healed, it just a bit red, which makes me think that it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. It actually feels good to share and get response plus also help others to see what&#39;s possible.

Heya,
</p>
<p>
This is my first post since a long time regarding to my grs with Dr. Taskov. This is my first post about:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/rkvr62/post_grs_5_12_weeks_dr_taskov/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/rkvr62/post_grs_5_12_weeks_dr_taskov/
</a>
</p>
<p>
It has been a little bit over  one year since I had my initial grs, and I&#39;m in hospital right now with my second revision  (which isn&#39;t perfect, but somewhat I can live with it). I had to struggle a lot with my clit being totally disposed at all time.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the first revision came up with a result that didn&#39;t changed anything to good.
</p>
<p>
I realized that my clit got reduced in size, something I actually didn&#39;t talked to my surgeon about, but I think it&#39;s covered by what I had to sign. It&#39;s actually kinda okay but if you see the pictures I&#39;m posting along with this text you will be able to see how despaired i was after (the last picture is after first Revision, the others been take shortly before the revision).
</p>
<p>
No wonder I&#39;m still a virgin ...xd (actually that&#39;s quite annoying when your genitalia make you feel that uncomfortable that you don&#39;t want to date :/)
</p>
<p>
Ok, after adding the pictures I must say I&#39;m glad the clit was reduced in size, in some angles it looks kinda huge.
</p>
<p>
Soonish I will show how it looks after 2nd revision (showing all regions).
</p>
<p>
Stay strong
</p>

It looks really good aesthetically. I second the other commenter in that this looks a lot like a natal vagina, and I genuinely wouldn&#39;t be able to tell this is a neovagina by looking at it. Some cis women do have larger clits that poke out, and I&#39;ve seen cis women with larger clits than yours. Generally I&#39;d say that your clit is within the &#34;normal&#34; range for natal vulvas. Your minora are also really good, among the best minora I&#39;ve seen on a neovulva. (I also have a natal vagina and have seen my fair share of cis women&#39;s pussies in my time, if that&#39;s worth anything, but I also don&#39;t think having a natal vagina automatically makes you a pussy expert so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily relevant here anyway lol.)

Thank you very much, in looking forward maybe you can comment when I post my current state of my vagina. Your words feel pretty good, I guess I was judging myself to hard. Every part of your comment matters to me ‚ò∫Ô∏è especially that part being not to far off from being natal xd

I honestly thought this was one of the posts from someone starting/showing tdick growth üò≥ i see a lot of up close and honestly that looks very very very similar to how i was pre t !! ETA: i saw you&#39;re worried abt it being more exposed, if that&#39;s abt the hood not covering it, once you&#39;re healed, you can actually try n stretch the foreskin there to get it some more length. It takes s while but it helps (:

Aww, this one feels especially  good and that&#39;s a good idea, I think I will give it a shot and gentle trying to stretch it. This is gonna work out , tyvm for sharing your experience ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ó It actually looks already good but I would never have had the idea to stretch it &gt;:3c

That&#39;s why I was so devastated after the first revision. I mean it&#39;s a thing to get it not covered in first attempt (he is actually advertising his surgery as one step surgery , no revision needed -.-) but to leave it blank again . I had a friend of mine when I was realising i would need a revision ask him, how the clit is supposed to be covered and his answer was &#34;like cis girls, from their labia minora&#34; and I&#39;m like well doesn&#39;t it start from the hood?
</p>
<p>
I think I can accept the outgoing from the 2nd revision (I actually asked him, if he is able to change it to the minimum I want, that it opens up closer to the clit, but he said no , too much risk to damage and loose feeling in clit (while I actually think he doesn&#39;t want to do work at my vagina for a 4th time lmao -.-).
</p>
<p>
My wish would have been a clithood that always covers a bit from my clit and doesn&#39;t divide itself into the two labia minora to early and I explained actually exactly how I want it to have done twice and twice I&#39;m at least semi disappointed, but this time, it&#39;s something I can live and go on with . I&#39;m actually grateful that I got a result that feels okay and after all your lovely comments even better for me.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for cheering me up and as soon as I&#39;m ready to show my sweet vajayjay shaved I gonna update -w-

Really, this is one of the beautifulest neovulva/vagina I&#39;ve ever seen, your labias minora are just perfect and your clit really looks like a cis one. You should try to have a look on
<a href="/r/bigclit" rel="nofollow">r/bigclit
</a>
, a lot of people with a natal vulva have a big clit, personally I&#39;m born with a vulva and I want to have your clit size ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
You can have a clit reduction if you feel uncomfortable with the one you have, of course, but your vulva really looks cis actually :)
</p>
<p>
Good luck !

Sorry, but how is this failed? Are you numb in certain spots or do you have hair inside? Because look-whise this is one or te best results I‚Äôve seen. If I hadn‚Äôt already payed my surgeon I would go to this Taskov without thinking twice.

Well I have a bit hair at the entrance, but that&#39;s something that I can address. no numb spots and after all of your feedback I can live much better with what I got now. Just one more day in hospital and I gonna show it off. Thanks for everyone&#39;s feedback, much appreciated&lt;3
</p>
<p>
Somehow the uncovered clit made me really disphoric I had no idea that is so common around cis vulvas
