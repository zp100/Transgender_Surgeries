Hi all, I thought I&#39;d just make a post to share some things I&#39;ve learned while booking my SRS at the Suporn Clinic (with Dr. Bank if anyone&#39;s curious).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Booking while under 18
</strong>
</p>
<p>
You won&#39;t have any issues booking if you&#39;re under 18 (I booked when I was 17), as long as you will be 18 at the time of surgery. I know people have had questions about this, so hopefully this will clear it up!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Financial logistics while under 18
</strong>
</p>
<p>
You likely won&#39;t be able to do a wire transfer while you&#39;re under 18 (I could not, and I assume other banks would be the same), and you likely won&#39;t be able to use any other global transfer services either. In order to book a date at the Suporn clinic, you will need to pay a 20% deposit within 21 days, so if you will be under 18 during this time, you&#39;ll need to transfer the money to an adult in your life and get them to make the transfer for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Parental consent while under 20
</strong>
</p>
<p>
You will not only need parental consent for surgery in Thailand if you&#39;re under 20, but at least for the Suporn Clinic, you will need a parent to accompany you to sign the papers in person. As far as I know this information isn&#39;t online, I found out through contacting the clinic. Obviously this will be an extra financial burden, as well as a big ask for your parent(s), so make sure to plan accordingly.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t asked the clinic about parental consent for revisions, but I&#39;d imagine it would be the same. You&#39;ll want to either plan to be able to bring a parent for a revision, or book your surgery at a date where you&#39;ll be 20 during the free revision period. I chose to do the second.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I just got confirmation from the clinic that a parent would need to accompany you for a revision if you&#39;re under 20.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this information is helpful! I&#39;ll try to update this post if I find anything more that&#39;s relevant.

Regarding the free revision period, I’d ask them to extend it. I don’t they thought about the implications for under 20’s and it’s not reasonable.

Really good point, it won&#39;t be an issue for me personally (I&#39;ll be 20 during most of the free revision period, just based on when it was convenient to schedule surgery), but I&#39;d hope the clinic would be able to accommodate others. Booking a second flight and extra accommodations would certainly add a lot of cost to the free revision.
