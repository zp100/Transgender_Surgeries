The more I see of others results the more I am upset about my very poor outcome with James Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
These pictures demonstrate the difference in closure technique between my rushed botch job in 75 minutes as an NHS patient and more recent results.
</p>
<p>
No care was taken during closing my wound and it looks awfull and very obvious.
</p>
<p>
I was left in excruciating pain while in hospital and ignored by multiple nurses and doctors who said I could not have anything stronger than paracetamol and ibuprofen for the pain.
</p>
<p>
They have my complaint.
</p>
<p>
If you choose Bellringer please be aware that if he is having an off day or just can&#39;t be bothered you could end up looking like me or worse and suffer with serious mental health issues and chronic pain post op.

Do you know if the complaint can/will go anywhere? Are NHS doctors accountable to patients in any way?

I beleive the surgeon and the hospital would rather fix my issues than have the complaint proceed further. They have arranged that a different surgeon will look at it at my request as I don&#39;t want to be anywhere near Bellringer again.
</p>
<p>
Tbh going back to the same hospital is causing me severe anxiety and GP has given me diazipam to get through the consultation.

Ask for Tina Rashid, she does good work, from what has been shared. Bellringer is like a coin toss but the constant seems to be that his bedside manner is awful. He needs to be managed closely by another senior surgeon.
</p>
<p>
That suture work is amateur level. Is he experiencing cognitive decline?

I had my surgery done by Rashid but Bellringer was checking on me. Rashid did amazing but whenever Bellringer came in he was so rude. I remember saying my pressure tape was uncomfy and he legit just ripped it all off with zero care at all. He did it fast and would pinch fuck outta me while ripping it all off and THEN HE LEFT A BUNCH ON and said “eh ill get a nurse to do the rest.” I feel so lucky I had Rashid when hearing about other peoples experiences too. Rashid is so great with questions and she helped me with my first dilation and was so sweet when I was panicking

Holy shit that looks terrible, especially the huge side scars, if i were you id get a different surgeon to perform the revisions, and google their results very carefully. Dont perform self surgery-even seasoned surgeons wont do it to themselves unless they are in emergency situations

It does look like a lack of care and pride in craftsmanship are evident in your pictures.  Good luck with your remediation efforts.

Sorry about the scars, altho this seems typical (IMO, Genes play big role), and you can use laser skin treatments to remove the scars. You MUST do it before they turn white, otherwise it wont work.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck!

Dont be condescending. The wiki shows a variety of scarring and everyone is different. Typically, scarring is expected.

They&#39;re talking nonsense. You don&#39;t treat a scar with lasers before it matures, ever. Talk about rancid advice...

If you google it there are many clinics who do it. No need to be nasty.

Thanks but I&#39;m either getting them cut out and redone or I am doing it myself. There are lumps under both scars as they were too painful to massage and I have stabbing pains in them several times a day.
</p>
<p>
I refuse to live like this and the only reason I haven&#39;t tried it myself is a consultation next month.
</p>
<p>
I have what I need already. Lots of morphine, numbing injections, suture kit, somewhere clean to work and scalpels, all sterile. I have been practicing for the past few months and my stitches are almost invisible. I also have a lot more motivation that anyone else to do a decent job and only myself to blame if I screw it up. Also my sister is a nurse and lives 2 minutes away, just in case :)
</p>
<p>
Edit, well I guess that&#39;s a bad idea considering some of the replies. Just hope the consultation goes well :)

Thanks I guess for reporting this to Reddit Resources etc.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m already on multiple medications for neuropathic pain, PTSD, anxiety and Depression post op. Thete is nothing else anyone can do other than fix the mess in my crotch and give me some hope of climaxing again.
</p>
<p>
I have asked for therapy but the waiting list is years long and I would rather save my money than waste it on some quak that knows nothing about being trans. I have done more than enough crying I just want the bloody thing fixed so I can maybe sleep on my side without a pillow between my legs.
</p>
<p>
Having the previous parts was much better than the crap I have right now.

I recommend pinktherapy.com
</p>
<p>
You can find a queer therapist that will be able to understand you and your issues. They operate in the UK and I found my own therapist through them and I&#39;ve been with her for years now.
</p>
<p>
Please speak to somebody before trying to do something this risky

I second this. I don’t know how things really work over in the UK, but maybe talk to an online therapist or barring that go to the emergency room or something. You say your sister is a nurse, so maybe reach out to her for support? Anything other than mutilate yourself and end up permanently disfigured or dead. Right now you have some temporary scarring that can be fixed. I’ve seen much worse results end up practically good as new after a revision with a better surgeon. You try and “operate” on yourself, you’ll be lucky if you don’t end up dead. I am deeply concerned about your safety if that’s the mindset you’re in. Please find some help as soon as possible.

It hurts me to hear you say that. Please call a trusted friend, family member, or your local emergency services at once and talk to somebody before you do something you can’t take back. I have been on the receiving end of bad or complicated surgery, and I know how heartbreaking it can be. I have also had corrective surgery that fixed me up and now it’s nothing but a bad memory. There is help out there, so please don’t give up now.

I know it may be fixable but it&#39;s looking like I will never climax again and I doubt that anyone can restore sensation to a clitoris.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to do anything stupid even though I really want to. I promised my mother that I would not kill myself after my brother died 4 years ago. It just feels like I&#39;m missing a huge part of me and I&#39;m never going to get it back. I can&#39;t even be intimate with my girlfriend any more because I just end up in tears due to lack of sensation when we are trying to pleasure eachother. It&#39;s killing me that I&#39;m becoming distant and that she cannot help me when though she tries so hard.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m taking my pills and having an early night, I have been on here too long today 😥

Absolutely do not attempt anything so risky. If you think your result is bad now, you would be a mutilated and probably dead mess after that. I’m  sorry that you’re hurting, but you know this is a crazy idea. There are good surgeons out there that can fix you up, and with proper care and laser treatments you can still get a great result. Have you been getting any counseling to help you deal with your (understandable) stress?

Quite an achievement getting the drugs, but what have you been practicing with/on?
</p>
<p>
I’ve noticed in by researching that there’s quite a lot of knowledge that’s not written down or discussed and presumably doctors pick it up in during training. Working on yourself is not an ideal time to find out what you don’t know.
</p>
<p>
It would definitely be better to find a decent plastic surgeon to do the work, and the good thing with lots of research is you know more about how to evaluate them.

You can buy training aids online and a lot of plastic surgery resources are freely available.
</p>
<p>
Pork is also close but the skin is much tougher than human skin and the layers are a lot thicker. Doesn&#39;t make a lot of difference to a needle or a scalpel though.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to do it, I&#39;m just keeping myself occupied by seeing how difficult or in fact how easy it is to do tidy stitches. It&#39;s just made it more obvious he didn&#39;t put any effort in at all.
</p>
<p>
My mental state is just all over the place if I&#39;m honest. I can&#39;t deal with the regret of letting him do it, I feel like I&#39;m letting everyone down by just not accepting it&#39;s crap and getting over it. I just want one thats not painful but has some pleasurable sensation, it doesn&#39;t have to look perfect but it needs to look a hell of a lot better than it does. It also smells bloody awfull, like really bad. I have started douching it with salty water and at least the stench isn&#39;t as bad now but I shouldn&#39;t have to do this crap every day.

Performing surgery on yourself is an absolutely awful idea. Please, wait for your consult. If that consult doesn’t go well, schedule another. Don’t attempt surgery on yourself.

Ya, the scars are unacceptable, I would put an attorney in place asap regardless of the hospital offering another surgeon, this is negligence. Be ready to sue.

Hi Unhappy Bunny893,
</p>
<p>
Thank You for sharing. I don’t believe sharing something like this is ever easy. I would seek therapy if this had happened to me. Keeping sane would be my first priority. After, that I would seek a professional I trust to correct a botch of a professional. In the EU, can you see a surgeon in another country without additional expense, other than travel and lodging?

Yeah but the only reason it looks like that is because I had dehiscence at the fourchette and extra skin healed over to partially cover the entrance.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a pain to pull it out of the way to get a dilator in and still need to do it every day at 9 months post op or it is even more painful if I miss one.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice if the replacement surgeon could keep the entrance looking enclosed but I&#39;m not sure if that is possible.

Since you haven&#39;t gone into any depth about your other issues, I can only address what you&#39;ve said directly.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes people scar a lot.
</p>
<p>
If you attempt to cut out your scars yourself, that will not go well. Please see a plastic surgeon for plastic surgery concerns. Please see a mental health professional and tell them about your desire to do self-surgery.

Still need to dilate once a day at 9 months while other girls are at once a week at 4 months. If miss one day it takes half hour of pain to get it in.
</p>
<p>
Urine leaks so I need to wear a pad 24/7.
</p>
<p>
No clitoral sensation and g-spot sensation is not as good as pre-op. Can&#39;t climax.
</p>
<p>
The rest of my issues are in my previous posts.

At 9 months you are still meant to be once a day. That&#39;s normal. I had mine just not long after you and I&#39;m still dilating once per day. It will tighten up. Nobody is once per week at 4 months. The instructions at this point is if comfortable you can maybe drop every other day but if still tough go back once per day for longer then try again. It over a year for once per week if ever is my understanding.

There was a post made today on this Reddit made by one of Tina&#39;s patients. I&#39;m not making it up.

<p>
Also glad you are happy with yours. I&#39;m just adding it to the pile of private results that he doesn&#39;t rush in 75 minutes like his NHS botch jobs. He is the most awful human being I have ever met.

Again... self-surgery is not the solution. To any of these issues. I could go down the list and say why, but it should be obvious. Please do not attempt that. It will not help.
</p>
<p>
As for the rest... once daily at 9 months is absolutely normal. Literally looking at my post-op info packet right now - it only recommends once a week at one year. And improper or insufficient dilation can make that timeline longer, even if you are dilating once a day.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a long healing process. It can be difficult to have patience for your body, but it really does take a long time. And I understand that many things can make that patience more difficult, especially real issues.
</p>
<p>
Issues with urination are often fixable with a visit to a physical therapist, and 9 months is well within the healing period for nerves and other tissue, and especially if you&#39;re still having inflammation or even often issues with insecurity, those can seriously interfere with your ability to orgasm.

Yes bodies heal different but I wasn&#39;t even given a fighting chance, with shit stitches an ugly huge scar was pretty much guaranteed.

I wish I had as well rather than my crotch bring butchered but don&#39;t be put off by my experience with one surgeon.
</p>
<p>
There are many surgeons that can do a very good and visually passing job.
</p>
<p>
It hasn&#39;t put me off getting FFS but has made me realise that when I get it done, it&#39;s going to be by the best in the world, Facial Team rather then the first one im offered.

Maybe, but these are intentional sloppy work, not what I was expecting and not acceptable.
</p>
<p>
The whole point of this operation is to releive or reduce dysphoria. Leaving huge awfull scarring actually makes it worse!
