I mean you can really only decide that for yourself, but imo if you think you&#39;d enjoy having different genitals enough that you&#39;re willing to go through the rough recovery then go for it.
</p>
<p>
Personally my bottom dysphoria is bad enough that it effects my life negatively every single day and I know it would be improved significantly with bottom surgery. But also like, you don&#39;t need bad bottom dysphoria to need bottom surgery; you could just be euphoric from having different bits and that&#39;s ok too.

Not OP but have questions myself.
</p>
<p>
I remember tucking as a teen before I suppressed it all for 40 years. I just accepting I’m trans ~ 2 years ago and started HRT 5+ months ago.
</p>
<p>
Over the past decade I started having ED issues and it stressed the hell out of me. Now, sex is only possible with the assist of Viagra. The lack of spontaneous erections is wonderful. While on certain antidepressants, I was getting 7+ painful erections every night. It sounds pathetic but it felt traumatic and I hated them.
</p>
<p>
While sex is enjoyable, to a degree. Since starting HRT, my penile skin is very tender and after sex, it feels like I jacked off with 40 grit sand paper. Trust me in saying there’s enough lubrication. Note that I can only orgasm when in a certain position, where I can imaging being penetrated.
</p>
<p>
I have been tucking nearly fulltime now and seeing the flat feminine profile feels good. I’ve alway though that my junk was ugly and was intrigued by the thought of having a vagina instead.
</p>
<p>
Now when I tuck, I question if it is due to dysphoria and wondering if it may increase over time?
</p>
<p>
I can’t say that it is uncomfortable having my OEM equipment but think I’d be happy with the upgrade custom design. That said, I didn’t recognize 45+ years of dysphoria until it progressed to the point of being debilitating.
</p>
<p>
Did your dysphoria grow over time? Does my experience resonate with yours?

Pain on erection like you describe can be mitigated with the application of testosterone gel - I got the idea from Will Powers, had my doctor prescribe it, and it worked for me. I don’t experience near as much pain as I was. I apply it once every 10 days. Just sharing :)

Thanks for that advice. I knew about the gel. What I was referring to however was pre-HRT. I was getting ridiculously painful erections that would wake me all hours of the night.

My bottom dysphorias definitely grown over time, but in my case i think it&#39;s mostly due to other dysphoria that ive had going away. Like once hrt kicked in and i stopped hating my body as much, my face dysphoria and bottom dysphoria both got way worse. And since covid started i scheduled bottom surgery and my face dysphoria has kinda gone away but my bottom dysphoria is a whole new level of hell basically.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also incredibly uncomfortable with my bits, to the point of really strong repulsion. Like the fact that I just have this thing on my body that shouldn&#39;t be there is absolutely disgusting. I also don&#39;t do anything with it during sex aside from using a vibrator, anything else makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry myself to death.

Thanks for sharing that. I&#39;m sorry to hear you are going through that. I knew that feeling of &#34;wanting to curl up into a ball and cry myself to death.&#34;  That was me with my body hair. I fear having those feelings/emotions ever again.
</p>
<p>
Since removing my body hair and starting HRT, my dysphoria is much more manageable. I have heard what you described as worsening dysphoria in other areas after addressing the predominant one. Sort of wack-a-mole. So I fear that my discomfort and indifference towards my junk is going to worsen...

(Full disclosure, i&#39;m pre-op FtWhatever)
</p>
<p>
I suppose it boils down to what you require out of surgery? &#34;Bottom surgery&#34; encompasses various procedures..some people just get orchiectomy, others go full nullo but don&#39;t opt for a neovag, there are various neovagina procedures including one that preserves the penis as it is... Research, research, research. Read personal accounts of people who were disatisfied with their procedures alongside the happy stories, including detransitioners. Be aware of everything that can go wrong, be ready to compromise on what your &#34;body goals&#34; are vs what is realistically medically possible.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what i&#39;ve been doing, anyway. I discovered that phalloplasty exists when i was 17, i&#39;m 29 now and have finally figured out how i want everything to be configured downstairs once i&#39;m able to pursue surgery. Not saying you need to take over a decade to think it through lol, but i&#39;ve read way too many detrans stories that wouldn&#39;t have happened if the person had &#34;slept on it&#34; for a few years, researched what was gonna be done to their body, talked to others who had been through the surgery etc. instead of rushing under the knife bc our culture is frankly built around instant gratification.
</p>
<p>
Closing thoughts: Instead of asking &#34;How do I know what I want&#34; try &#34;How can I figure out what I need&#34;?
</p>
<p>
P.S. Though i didn&#39;t have the words til highschool i&#39;ve known i was asexual since childhood, feel free to message me if you&#39;re questioning and wanna go into the details of dysphoria-induced sexual apathy vs lack of sexual attraction :&gt;

TW: self harm
</p>
<p>
For me, it was a no Brainer, I grew up hating my parts, I spent years trying to devise a way to have a horrendous accident to &#34;accidently&#34; have it removed without making it seem intentional, including lawn mower, power tool, engine belt &#34;slip&#34; I spent years cutting my parts with razor blades. I dreamed of so many awful ways to remove it so &#34;they would have to make me a girl&#34;
</p>
<p>
I hated sex, erections, topping bottoming everything. Never did it for me. Never understood what all the fuss was about.
</p>
<p>
I didnt successfully transition until I was 28, after 3 failed attempts in my younger years, and as soon as I was able, I had bottom surgery, penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
Recovery from that was the worst thing I ever went though, worse than when I shattered my pelvis. Having it removed though was worth every moment of pain, and rehabilitation after. My scar tissue from past self harm was an issue but my surgeon was able to make it work, with a substantial skin graft.
</p>
<p>
I now love sex, no more self harm, it doesn&#39;t make me ill to look down anymore.
</p>
<p>
Nobody can make this decision but you, but I will say if you are not 110% sure you want it, don&#39;t do it! It is a risky procedure, with a lifetime of care that follows, recovery is a bitch and you could loose your ability to orgasm entirely. Also it is not something you can change your mind about once it is done... It&#39;s not a procedure for the faint of heart.

Idk friend, but I&#39;m in much the same boat. I&#39;m honestly pretty keen on it, the upkeep, costs and risks weigh heavily on me. Plus I have a lot of dependants, being out of action for months is problematic.

It took a while to decide to do it.  An important thing for me was to separate sex from being comfortable with my body.  It was a bit of a long meandering journey to be honest before I was okay saying it out loud.  Wrote it all up below in a longer post

Because it controls almost every aspect of my life. I have extreme dysphoria from that. I even feel very uncomfortable when I go places because it’s just in the way. I also get a extreme sense of dysphoria after having sex, I’ve tried PIV sex and felt dysphoric af after that. Anal sex just hurts, so yeah I can’t wait until the day I’m post op.

Do you want to deal with the healing and permanent upkeep? For me, no, so I don’t plan on bottom surgery

Yeah, it&#39;s the same for me. Like, if I could get a vagina through magic, I&#39;d definitely do it! But the healing and the daily dilating seems too daunting to me. I definitely will have an orchi though.

I feel very much the way you do when it comes to sex and my penis.
</p>
<p>
The only time I can make myself be okay with it during sex is if I feel really intimately close to my partner and I know I have to use it to express my emotions physically. Other than that, I hate my penis.And I&#39;m thoroughly convinced that if I didn&#39;t have one, I would be interested in having sex at least twice as often as I currently do (which to be honest, it isn&#39;t very often, but still).

Eh, my take is: I don&#39;t feel dysphoric about my penis, but I think a vagina might be vaguely cool too.  I thought I wanted to get vaginoplasty due to fears around having a non-gender-conforming body.  However, I talked with my friend about her dysphoria before vaginoplasty and the aftercare and concluded it&#39;s definitely not worth it for me for now.  She basically described it as &#34;don&#39;t look down&#34; in the shower for her.  And the aftercare is definitely a commitment for the first few months.
</p>
<p>
In the long run I might be interested in penile-preserving vaginoplasty, but I&#39;m content to wait until I hear about more experiences with those techniques, so it&#39;s just an orchi for me for now.

its also normal for one&#39;s desires to change over time.  hrt can also affect things in unanticipated ways...
</p>
<p>
for someone who isn&#39;t sure, i think two things help... one is talking to people with a lot of different types of experiences in terms of orientations, romantic inclinations (doesn&#39;t always match orientation), general interest in sex, interest in sex tied to specific person/people (general versus specific libido), etc.  (its possible to have high libido also with no interest in sex)
</p>
<p>
other thing that helps is coming to an hrt regimen that you&#39;re comfortable with long term.  hormones do matter, otherwise i&#39;d still be romantically attracted to women and interested in sex after a long courting period.  being now attracted to men is... quite strange unexpected side effect.  (i know it wasn&#39;t suppression, but takes too long to decide how).
</p>
<p>
so in the case that hormones affect what you want, it helps to allow things to settle.  (well, it takes so long to get approved for surgery that you&#39;ll know by then anyway ;) ... what i think i mean is not to *worry* so much now as what you want might change.
</p>
<p>
for me, i dreamed of physical change of genitals since i was 5 and only knew what i had and didn&#39;t know what girls had other than &#39;not penis&#39;.  &#39;not this, but w/e that is&#39;.  Only after my orientation changed did i start to really feel a need to have &#39;the other&#39;.  (being woken up and knowing my dream was yet again post op PiV sex... yeah... forget &#39;le meme chose&#39;... not even close lol).
</p>
<p>
there might be a thing with nerve connections between gonads and brain and perhaps during hrt for some people that lack of connection (?) can cause physical apathy... or it could be emotional.  i mean, i know that i lack interest at all.  i mean, always low libido unless i was in very close trust with partner (then insatiable? :) )... but now its less.  is it a brain thing?  or i lack the parts i need to be with a man? i don&#39;t know :)
