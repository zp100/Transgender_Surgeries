I have five days left in this recovery house. Everything here is amazing. The staff are great and do their job like they are suppose to.
</p>
<p>
I used to be addicted to Percocet and meth and I have been clean for over three years.
</p>
<p>
I’m worried for when I go home.
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to take them but I’m in pain. I’ve asked to have them cut in half but they say no.
</p>
<p>
My limit is really high so these drugs, including the sleeping pill don’t do much except take some pain away for an hour or two.  And the sleeping pill doesn’t do anything.
</p>
<p>
My choice is 2 of the crappiest Tylenol’s they sell. Tramadol. Which lasts about 20 min and I can’t have again for 8 hours. oxycodone. Which last about two hours but makes me feel high, itchy and gross. I seriously feel like I’ve relapsed...

So, great news! A doctor came in here and agreed I shouldn’t be taking the oxycodone. I am now aloud to take the tramadol every 4 hours as well as Tylenol and anti-inflammatories every 6 hours. It’s not completely off the opioids but they are now manageable with less likelihood of addiction.
</p>
<p>
All the support from everyone still means a lot and I thank you for it!

If you&#39;re having problems with the tramadol wearing off, there&#39;s a slow release version that lasts 12 hours. Good for overnight.

Hopefully it gets better soon. Also, you can take tramadol with an nsaid and acetaminophen. Makes it stronger. Best ask the doctor first I suppose.

After 3 years what are the chances you still have a tolerance? The oxy may last longer than you think.
</p>
<p>
FWIW I&#39;ve never been addicted and also found 1 percocet to be insufficient for my pain the first few days. My script said to take 1 - 2 every 4 - 6 hours so I&#39;d take 2 at night before bed and get like 4 hours of sleep out of it.
</p>
<p>
The pain wasn&#39;t horrible, like a constant throbbing 3 or 4 out of 10 at the worst. Enough to be annoying and keep me awake.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s been over a week since your surgery ask if you can switch to ibuprofen. I was allowed to take it after one week and it works better for me than narcotic pain medicine in most situations.

I was on tylenol (650mg) and advil (600mg) at the same time, and then that was staggered with gabapentin (300mg) (which is for nerve pain) and I was in almost no pain at all.  I would see if they can prescribe you gabapentin.  I didn&#39;t take even one dose of opiates after my surgery with this regimen, but I also had very little swelling so, ymmv

Yes I asked about ibuprofen l, I am going to try and contact my GP and get a prescription and just go fill it here. May be expensive, but I’d like do have some sort of pain management and not be scared at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Scared may be the wrong word but there go to script when I leave is hydrocodone.
</p>
<p>
Both me and my girlfriend are recovering addicts and I don’t want any of it in our house to keep us both safe. We have to much to loose and nether of us can be trusted to stay sober with drugs in the home!!

A few years ago I had knee surgery and they gave me perocet, it was an absolute horrible experience and I never ever want to touch it again.  Every time I took it I wasn&#39;t constantly on the verge of a panic attack and I was left with on going anxiety issues afterwards that I had to seek treatment for.  I can&#39;t even imagine what you&#39;ve gone through, this doesn&#39;t even compare, but I get it.

Thanks, I have pm’d another user who gave me some more options involving someone I can trust to hold them for me. I’m not happy there’s others out there with the same problem, but the support from the community helps!!

ask for benedryl for sleep (and help with the opiod itchyness), and stay regular on the tylenols. Did you access help from a counselor when getting clean before, or a step group group? Thats an amazing accomplishment, lean on whatever supports worked for you before.

If you live in a legal state I recommend some good strong weed. I hate pills to you literally have to fight me to take them. Weed takes more than the edge off and leaves you giggly and able to eat. If you don’t want the high feeling hey some good CBD oil. Make sure you  are resting and taking it easy. And don’t worry if you live in a non legal state I won’t judge
