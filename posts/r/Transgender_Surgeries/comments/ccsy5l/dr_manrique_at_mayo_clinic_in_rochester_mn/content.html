I had my surgery, on May 16th 2019, in Rochester, MN. First of all, I regret going with him. Although, he has received many awards; but, his interpersonal skills sucks. For example, in my pre-op appointment, he told me, &#34;you know that we are imitating a cis-women vagina,&#34; he says. In my head, I was like--duh. It did hurt me a lot, because he should&#39;ve used other terminology to described how he was going to do the vaginoplastly. That&#39;s not all, in my last day at the clinic. The nurse misgendered me, while she was talking to the resident (MD). It is so upsetting that allegedly Dr. Manrique&#39;s team are trans-friendly and &#34;trained,&#34; to care for their trans patients, but the lack of training and the nurse not well-equipped made my experience at Mayo Clinic the worst feeling ever. Further, the nurse didn&#39;t taught me to dilate properly and because of that I lost a lot of depth. Now, I&#39;m suffering the consequences of having a shallow canal. Indeed, I would need a revisional surgery; but, now, I would like the peritoneal pull through technique, in order, to have a greater depth. Does anyone have dealt with a shallow canal and a revisional surgery?

Sorry to hear of your problems. I&#39;m not sure, but there there may be some info in the wiki that could be of help.

I have a shallow canal too, after vaginoplasty.  Please keep me posted on who you decide to go with for revision sugery.

Do you know, what would be the benefits of the colon graft vs.PPV?

Thank you, so much. By the way, would loss of depth can occur on both PPV and Sigmoid method? For example, if I get the Sigmoid method and I don&#39;t dilate as much could I loose depth?

What would be the most appropriate response to my surgeon, when requesting that I want either the PPV or Sigmoid method? He wants to do the revisional surgery,which he would go into my canal and help me regained what I have lost. The caveat is that I would only get as possibly 2.5~ inches of depth. I would rather go through the Sigmoid method and gained more depth. Although, I know is more invasive and the chances of getting a fistula is higher.

Thank you, again. This has been a nightmare dealing with the surgeon and the staff at Mayo Clinic. I hope I would have done this SRS with a surgeon, who is both interpersonal/surgical skilled. I hope he doesn&#39;t denied a referral or the letter of revisional surgery that I need to hand-out to my future surgeon.

Well, I started off with 3.5 inches, and he stated that a range of 3.5-4 was an average depth of a women. Now, I only have 1inch and he seems not concern at all. I know they didn&#39;t assess my biological tissue and proceeded with the penile inversion technique. I hate that he hasn&#39;t been truthful and genuine.

Huh, we had surgery there on the same day. I&#39;m surprised that I didn&#39;t see you (though maybe I did and just didn&#39;t realize you were an SRS patient too.)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you had a bad experience, though. I had Dr. Martinez and thought he was very caring and considerate, and that he did what he could with my minimal material to begin with. I hope you can figure your stuff out.

Dr. Martinez? I had Dr. Manrique and he hasn&#39;t perfected the art of vaginoplasty. Basically, I have a botched neovagina.
