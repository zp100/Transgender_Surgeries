I&#39;m 10 weeks post op vaginoplasty and mostly over dehiscence and granulation issues etc. I&#39;m trying to build up strength again and walking around 2km a day, gradually increasing it but making sure I stop before causing more pain. I have nerve damage in inner thigh and bum area so it&#39;s going quite slow.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I&#39;m looking for exercises that will help relax my internal pelvic area and muscles. I have had some success identifying the muscles at the entrance of the vagina and tensing / relaxing them is becoming easier the more I do it. It is making dilating more comfortable especially the first part of insertion. Dilating twice a day.
</p>
<p>
The problem I&#39;m having is further inside about half way / 7cm in. I can feel it painfully pressing against my &#39;g spot&#39; and it&#39;s quite difficult / painful to get to full depth.
</p>
<p>
I make sure I have emptied my bowl and bladder before hand and am using enough lube to coat the dilator soul source violet / just over an inch wide.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think there are any muscles in there to relax and it&#39;s ok after a few minutes pushing through the pain, I can then go up to the next size and it slides in easily to about 15cm
</p>
<p>
Am I doing something wrong ?
</p>
<p>
Can I do anything different ?
</p>
<p>
Any other suggestions or is this just how it is ?
</p>

Should have added I have been referred to physio but it could be months before I&#39;m seen due to COVID etc

I never needed physio post-op and I’ve never heard of any trans person needing it after GRS.
</p>
<p>
Dilation isn’t really a “pleasant” thing to do, as it involves at least a minimal level of discomfort. The good news is that you basically just need to maintain depth. Once the dilator’s in there, leave it there for at a few minutes (keeping in there with your hand) at as much depth as you can manage. It gets easier as time goes on.

Vikki Le a trans woman I follow on you tube had physiotherapy to help recover from her surgery.
</p>
<p>
Also was not my idea it was my GP as they were concerned about my difficulty walking due to the nerve damage and they thought it would help in general as the other issue I described to them is similar to vaginismus and they thought physio would help.
</p>
<p>
From the referral, they are able to help with....
</p>
<p>
Pelvic pain (including pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain)
</p>
<p>
Vaginal pain (including vaginismus and vulvodynia)
</p>
<p>
Dyspareunia (pain during intercourse)
</p>
<p>
Perineal / episiotomy scarring
</p>
<p>
Pelvic floor muscle weakness / tightness
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t know where to start exercising
</p>
<p>
I just wanted to know if I could start doing something now rather than wait weeks or months until I can see a professional.
