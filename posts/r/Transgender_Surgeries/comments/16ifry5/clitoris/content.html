I don&#39;t. But Brassard is known for pretty small clitorises (clitorii? Lmao).
</p>
<p>
Speaking specifically about his results and not other surgeons, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time that I couldn&#39;t see a clitoris in pictures but it turns out it&#39;s there working just fine.
</p>
<p>
It would, however, be the first time I&#39;ve heard of him failing to construct one. He&#39;s not like, negligent in that way. Ask him to confirm but unless you had identified a clit before that seems to have disappeared (necrosed or fallen offâ€”which you probably would have noticed) you&#39;re probably fine.

It should be around where that blue stitch is at the top of your vagina. As others have said, it&#39;s often hard to spot visually with Brassard. I asked him to show me where mine was at my post-op appointment.
</p>
<p>
You likely won&#39;t be able to tell where it is until at least month 2, which is when you&#39;re encouraged to start exploring the area with your fingers. Once you do that, and the nerves start waking up, you should be able to figure out where it is fairly quickly.

I would suggest to wait a little longer to let everything fall into place. To me it seems quite swollen. Have u stretched the labia a little bit to look more closely inside? Wish you a quick recovery ðŸ˜Š

I see the pinky skin is not like a healthy skin, so going to a local hospital for sure. Sweating and humidity around above area are not good for your &#34;butterfly&#34;. Be careful! A right treatment should make everything alright. You should use betadine (povidone-iodine chemical) for your new wound because it needs to be dry and clean for healing faster
