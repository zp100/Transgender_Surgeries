I&#39;ve gained weight between covid, losing my job that afforded me time to exercise, and HRT.  Alot of it.  Now I can&#39;t find a surgeon who will even take a consultation with me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to lose the weight, but honestly, I haven&#39;t been in the magical BMI range in 17 years.  I&#39;m worried that I&#39;ll never be able to reach that standard.  I need to lose 80 pounds before I can maybe get an exception.  I know how to do it, but between all the anxiety, lack of time, and constant stress I just can&#39;t seem to muster the effort to try.
</p>
<p>
Edit:  I don&#39;t need dieting advice.  I have been dieting for more than half my life.  Telling me not to drink sodas or lay off sweets is not new.  I&#39;ve cut sugar out of my diet to the point where I get physically ill.  This is a matter of being judged by a number, which was never meant to be anything other than a statistical range for large groups of people, without ever even being seen.

Surgery is one hell of a carrot (ie good motivation to loose weight)

If surgeons won&#39;t even do consultations with you, please listen. Recovery is hard enough already in the healthy weight range. Surgery is already risky enough in the healthy weight range. You can lose this amount within 2022. You really can! ‚ù§ üí™

Right there with you. I have to lose about 80 lbs before my insurance will even think about covering surgery. I haven&#39;t been that light since junior high more than 30 years ago. Gained 50 in the last 8 months or so after switching to IM injections. I knew how to lose it, but it&#39;s different with the E.

Hiya! I am on a journey to lose 140 lbs. For me, high blood pressure, wanting a long life, and transition were my motivations.
</p>
<p>
There is no right answer here though, sadly. I know so very, very well how personal all of it is and how you can&#39;t create motivation and energy for someone else, they have to find it for themselves. All I can say is that I support you and care and know what you are going through!
</p>
<p>
There are surgical options, obviously, but if you&#39;re anything like me you&#39;re probably afraid of them, don&#39;t like the massive list of risks, and want to do it naturally.

Yeah.  I&#39;m not a big fan of surgery for weight loss.  Just too scary.  I mean, to me that is saying something given the surgery I want to have.

My wife struggled with weight her whole life, had bariatric surgery a few years ago, lost 60+ pounds. Honestly, give it due consideration. It worked very well for us.

With all due respect telling someone to consider a highly invasive surgery for weight loss where complications can cause them to never enjoy eating without nausea and pain for the rest of their life. Not to mention nutrition issues or any other major side effects that messing up with that surgery can cause is unhinged to me. Many people have success stories with many different surgeries. You are not a doctor you do NOT know OP you have literally no right to be recommending something so medically focused and sometimes entirely unnecessary. I&#39;m glad that surgery worked for you and your wife. Stop giving harmful medical advice. If OP has an eating disorder and/or body dismorphia you could of triggered either of them. You do not know OP this advice is extremely unhelpful bordering on harmful.

Uh ok, so people should&#39;ve give anecdotes about surgical procedures on a sub called transgender_surgeries. Sure, that totally checks out. Anyways, I&#39;m gonna go have surgery now.

I have seen it work for many people, but I have also seen many people fail at it.  My concerns are mostly that I will be able to maintain the restrictions needed to maintain my health and weight loss afterwards.  There is also the cost, as my insurance won&#39;t cover it.

I was in the same boat a year ago; I started taking wegovy, and have lost 63 lbs and now have a surgery date.
</p>
<p>
Hope is there, it requires a lot of work.
</p>
<p>
I was desperate, and nearly suicidal, and after seeing the changes in my body and appetite, I started gaining hope.

Have you tried Dr. Stiller in Oregon?  Also in addition to diet and exercise get on semaglutide weekly injections.  It really helps.

Just out of curiosity, what is the acceptable BMI range? I generally fluctuate from 30-32 (gained about 50lbs since starting HRT two years ago). I assume that&#39;s too high, and I&#39;m already working on losing weight. Would be nice to know what the general requirements are though.

35 was the highest I could find, but that was by exceptions only.  Mostly they wanted up to 30 I&#39;m in the same boat between covid, HRT, and lifestyle changes caused by job change.

I‚Äôm sorry about your struggle. It‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs painful.
</p>
<p>
But being a nurse, and over the course of my long career I‚Äôve had experience in working with surgical patients.
</p>
<p>
Most of the time BMI is not important. In surgical patients however it very much is. Specifically, a higher BMI is going to put the patient at a much greater risk of complications, including wound dehiscence ( wound opening up ) and infection not just a here take this three times a day but sepsis, which can put you in the ICU on a ventilator, with drugs keeping your blood pressure up and multiple iv antibiotics. Sepsis kills.
</p>
<p>
On this point remember, especially if there‚Äôs bottom surgery being considered, it‚Äôs highly susceptible to becoming infected. It‚Äôs a preferred area for bacteria and yeast. (Dark, damp, and can be hard to keep clean)
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs not even discussing the higher chance of surgical failure due to difficulty in keeping blood flow to the surgical site. The adipose tissues (the little fat storage packs) interfere with that.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs also placing the patient at higher risk of problems during the surgery itself, just from the anesthesia. See
<a href="https://www.asahq.org/madeforthismoment/preparing-for-surgery/risks/obesity/">this link
</a>
</p>
<p>
And maybe this
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5881295/">link to study about abdominal surgeries
</a>
</p>
<p>
Your surgeon wants you to live long and enjoy your outcome. They want you to heal up and have the outcome you want.

That is good information to know.  And certainly from where I am now, I know that there is weight loss needed.  My main concern is that the goal is so unobtainable for me, and the information so poor as to why.  Most websites just simply say they refuse to work with people above a measure I have not not seen in almost 2 decades despite multiple attempts.

I fervently disagree with you. Two words: Comparative risks.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Okay, I&#39;ll expand on that. Firstly, I&#39;m not a nurse; I&#39;m envious of what you do and I respect that you have way more direct experience, but I have been a medic, a hospital admin staffer, and am back in school to try and become a doctor later in life so... I know at least some stuff.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, yes, we both know that at a per-thousand-people level, a significantly elevated weight increases risks. However, just as with every surgery, individualised risk should be assessed. Perform a full blood workup involving HBA1C, CBC, lipids, liver, and kidney panels, and/or ask for an EKG, and/or do a sleep apnea study, THEN review the risk.
</p>
<p>
Secondly: in GRS-specific research (Ives et al, 2019) the added risk is low. In that study - admittedly a small sample size - BMIs of 20-29 had a 16% risk. BMI 30-35 18%. If you include 30-39, you get 19%. That&#39;s... Not nothing, it&#39;s a statistically significant change and should absolutely be discussed with a patient and lifestyle explored, but there&#39;s no way that that small an additional risk should be an absolute contraindication! Heck, many other non-GRS surgeons allow the timing of smoking cessation to be a flexible requirement, and smoking more than doubles your risks, no? If 50-80% extra risk is fine, why is 3% more risk the end of the world? Meanwhile, OP themselves mentions that this is causing them extra anxiety. Speaking more generally, denial of treatment risks lives.
</p>
<p>
So... comparative risks. If the medical world swore by zero risk, there would be no such thing as plastic surgery in the first place. No transplants. A lot fewer medications. EVERYTHING is comparative risk.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I hope this doesn&#39;t come across as any sort of lack of respect, but I do believe that the worst-case scenarios you are outlining (while possible) are overinflated and overemphasized for GRS compared to other surgeries, and I am compelled to try and point out that institutional-level fallacy.

Nope, disagreement with reasonable discussion is always welcome. I think a good discussion is how we make progress in healthcare. Someone says ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI disagree‚Äù and I‚Äôm good with it if it improves outcomes.
</p>
<p>
And granted my surgical experience is not with the Gender affirming procedures. However, I have worked and still work (albeit in a different capacity) with surgeons. They are a special breed of physician, you may know that.
</p>
<p>
Remember, that there‚Äôs a lot going on here.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
The policy of the hospitals who do the surgery, which may limit due to (currently more evidence showing the increased risks) which may limit what procedures are allowed and under what circumstances.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the hospital is in the US they are penalized for surgical infections. Value based care looks at all surgical site infections, (also falls, urinary tract infections caused by Foley catheters, respiratory infections from ventilators, etc) if the hospital‚Äôs percentage passes a certain level, Medicare reimbursements drop, so we‚Äôre threatening the hospital bottom line, so the C Suite is going to be risk averse and avoid adding any more percentages. They will wait until the ‚Äúother hospital‚Äù does it and if things work out then they will look at changing, but money talks in a hospital, and surgeries are a huge money maker.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Another (but last) hospital point. We show up on public rating systems in addition to the surveys that are sent out. Don‚Äôt like something? It goes everywhere wether it‚Äôs warranted or not. My unit once had a very public complaint that no one would bring them a coke. Well on investigation I found that 1. We were in the middle of a code blue trying to save a life at that time. (2) it was a renal failure patient who can‚Äôt have colas and it was in their orders. But that‚Äôs not the story that everyone read. They read about the poor abandoned patient who couldn‚Äôt even get something to drink. Again, people read that review and say I am NOT going there.
</p>
<p>
We also have the individual ‚Äúright to practice‚Äù of the physicians to consider. If you get to med school (and I sincerely hope you do) you will have the right to made decisions regarding what your willing to do vs what you aren‚Äôt. You‚Äôll of course have your training to guide you, but you will also have position statements of your respective professional organization too. Such as this one
<a href="https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anae.13101">anesthesia position statement from 2015
</a>
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs something to consider also when that percentage point is no longer a mathematical representation but a living, breathing human being. If we‚Äôre talking about 19% each one of those is a person‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre going into the healthcare field, it sure isn‚Äôt for the money, it‚Äôs because you care, and if you can shave even one person off of that I‚Äôm betting you would.
</p>
<p>
And sample size does matter, you know this because you pointed it out. If the sample is too small to be representative of the larger population, it‚Äôs certainly a call for a more in depth study, but not enough to draw a conclusion from. Also, and I believe you know this too, there‚Äôs going to need to be multiple studies showing the same results.
</p>
<p>
I could go on, and in the end analysis I don‚Äôt completely disagree with your points. You make several good ones. And maybe you will be the one who finds a way. We can hope so. But with so little clinical research into us (we are in this case considered a protected class when it comes to human trials) providers are understandably cautious when it comes to us. At this point they only have vaguely similar things that they can use.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the great points you presented. Good luck in your pursuits!

Cheers, thank you! You also raise some interesting points, specifically with regard to policy; that&#39;s certainly a factor. I was certainly thinking more just abstract patient-focus, rather than politics. But yes, hopefully that confirms that I absolutely want the best for each and every person I have treated / will hopefully treat.
</p>
<p>
The model I&#39;m used to is (drastically oversimplified) each practitioner (MD, DO, NP) has their own corporation which is paid directly by the government, either salary or per-patient-service, with surgeons just having OR rights at 1-3 hospitals, depending but doing most of their practice in a normal medical building. Complaints or malpractice aside, I&#39;m not sure the hospitals track complications for private surgeons on this model.
</p>
<p>
That said, I have no idea how on-call / ER surgeons are handled either, so I could be full of crap! :P I&#39;m going to be aiming for general practitioner followed by opening a trans specialty clinic for first-line care, so I have done less research into surgery policies.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you see debate the same way I do. Have a great night!

I&#39;m in a similar situation. I have orthopedic issues, and am on a beta blocker that won&#39;t let my pulse rate to go over a hundred -- so aerobic exercise, by definition, is not possible for me. I have a consult scheduled with Gast for late July for vulvoplasty and BA.

I had my orchie in December, no prob. I expect my FFS to be done in June -- they&#39;re clearing insurance now, then will call to schedule. I have a consult for BA and zero-depth after that. I&#39;m 5&#39; 6&#34; and 240 lbs.

Have you tried GRS Montreal? They accept much higher weights than a lot of other surgeons,  explicitly including anyone up to BMI 40.
</p>
<p>
Another thought possibly worth looking into, I was briefly prescribed Saxenda injections to drop ~20 extra pounds before surgery myself. They&#39;re very expensive but if you have good coverage they may give you that little boost. (Note: Review the side effects, it&#39;s not an ideal prescription.)

Losing weight at a high BMI number is mostly about your food intake then how often your exercise. Cutting out a few guilty treats (like soda, cookies, not eating out) for a few days every single week will even reduce your weight gradually. As long as you had even less than 20 calories the prior week compared to this week, that&#39;s a win.
</p>
<p>
Getting to your target slowly might be discouraging
<em>
but
</em>
at the very least you&#39;re making the steps in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
(Also I&#39;d recommend dancing. Nothing crazy, just jam out casually to songs you like a few times a day. It&#39;s something fun, will get you moving and really helps with mental health and motivation. bonus points for dancing while cleaning lmao)

No one&#39;s bitter your weight loss advice is simplistic and easy to look up. Cutting out sugar is literally the easiest thing to do to assist weight loss. This is a sympathy post about how OP can&#39;t build a birdhouse and is feeling frustrated and you&#39;re regurgitating the prefab instructions on how to do it on the side of the box instead of offering any sort of comfort or relatability.
</p>
<p>
Giving you the benefit of the doubt I&#39;m going to hope you&#39;re not being condescending but the tone of this comment along with your edit afterward makes it seem like you think OP is so dumb they didn&#39;t understand that exercise and a calorie deficit was needed to lose weight. To me it seems like you&#39;re talking down to them and then get angry when people don&#39;t find you helpful. That&#39;s why you&#39;re getting downvotes if you&#39;re even getting enough to matter. When I&#39;m replying to this you&#39;re actively in the positive.

I don&#39;t really have anything to say to your reply.  I do feel the need to point out that you&#39;ve actively gendered OP when they didn&#39;t use any pronouns for themselves, didn&#39;t say what surgery they were going to get, don&#39;t have pronouns on their page, and many different genders and presentations come to this sub.

I&#39;m sorry people are being so restrictive on you and what they believe you need to do in order to obtain the surgery you need. I&#39;m also sorry we have such brain rot as a culture that a post obviously seeking sympathy has triggered such an immediate harmful landscape on this post. Next time I would probably recommend you reach out privately to your friends with these feelings if you don&#39;t want to get bombarded with weight loss tips.
</p>
<p>
I am also slowly currently losing weight. I&#39;m losing about 1 pound a week which means I&#39;m going to be losing your amount of weight in about a year and a half. My consolation for surgery is today so I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re going to say but I hope not to get the same news as someone with an ED. I&#39;m primarily losing weight to fit into more average clothes that aren&#39;t as expensive and hard to find and unattractive for my tastes. The fatphobia society puts on others is insane and I&#39;m sorry you have to struggle so much for basic needs and care. If possible it might be worth looking into other doctors to see if everyone says the same thing. If you have your heart put into one surgeon then I suppose it&#39;s between a rock and a hard place. :/
</p>

Good luck OP.

I knew the dietary tips were likely.  And even thought I could handle it.  I was wrong, but ah well.
</p>
<p>
And I don&#39;t disagree I need to lose weight, my main concern is that without ever having met me so many medical professionals have written me off as a lost cause.  I don&#39;t even have a preffered surgeon yet, but I was hoping to find one within 12 hours of me.

Yeah lots of people treat fat people as lesser than or unwilling or unable to change. It is garden variety fatphobia and stereotypes about laziness. I hope no matter what path you take you&#39;re able to achieve things that you want. I definitely believe life doesn&#39;t have to revolve around being or looking to be a certain size.
</p>
<p>
I hesitate to mention it because I do not want to give you more unsolicited health advice so I guess skip this next paragraph if you can not tolerate any sort of weight or nutrient reccs. I won&#39;t feel bad I want to give you an out I just also think maybe as someone who hates diet culture maybe my idea might be more tolerable to you. The last paragraph does not talk about weight loss stuff.
</p>
<p>
If you struggle with apps and diets that restrict your eating I personally keep track of my eating habits with chronometer. You do have to have an account (there is a free and paid version I use the free kind)  but I primarily use it for tracking my macronutrients (like fiber, B12, etc) and it&#39;s very easy for me to switch focus from the calorie counting aspect of things to the macronutrient part of things. Focusing on a different thing I got from the app helped me soothe my feelings on food (I have recovered from an ED). I&#39;m logging stuff to make sure I get enough fiber I don&#39;t care about calories. It also helps me focus on &#34;I want to eat this to get more B12 I don&#39;t care about calories&#34; as a mental thing. I&#39;m not lying either. I do go over some days and it&#39;s fine I&#39;m still losing weight which is the important part.  it also gives you realistic calories based off your current weight. I eat about 2600 calories working a manual labor job being about 270lbs and that&#39;s still enough for me to lose weight. It helps me not feel hungry bc my deficit does not need to be the like 1200 diets people go on that are very restrictive and hard to tolerate because I&#39;m bigger and on testosterone.
</p>
<p>
I think you&#39;re probably fine the way you are. I think that maybe there is a higher risk for surgery at some weights but I also think people are eager to tell fat people they need to lose weight even if the risk is insignificant or small. I don&#39;t know what you weigh but I just got done with a consultation for top surgery at 270lbs at 5&#39;5&#34; and it was no problem and didn&#39;t even come up. If there is no way you can have surgery and you still want it and you&#39;re hearing it from other doctors I would hope that there may be some basis for that and it&#39;s not a one off cruel doctor thing.  That being said if you do decide to pursue surgery I hope you&#39;re able to meet arbitrary goals set out for you by others to get the things you want. If they become unobtainable I hope that you are able find peace in what you can have. I promise not everyone out there has brain rot but in general I just would not talk about fat topics on Reddit. There&#39;s a lot of dieting and weight loss subs and the brain rot is so so bad here lol.

That is actually a very interesting new idea on the nutrient tracking.  I&#39;ve gotten back to just trying to limit carbs. not keto, just trying to be more mindful, more than anything else.
</p>
<p>
Another redditor did share some interesting reasoning (she is a nurse who works in surgical stuff).  There are good reasons, which are directly correlated to having extra fat in terms of blood flow, healing, and keeping the wounds dry.  It was actually really helpful to learn that while the drs still shouldn&#39;t probably reject people out of hand, there is at least a good reason that correlates really well to BMI for most individuals.

I&#39;m really sorry people are throwing unwanted dietary tips at you.
</p>
<p>
And surgeons should absolutely meet you and assess your health before telling you you can&#39;t have surgery. BMI is not meant for looking at individual people. The same BMI looks sooo different on different people. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s still used this much in the medical field.
</p>
<p>
The only advice I can give is to get your thyroid levels checked if you haven&#39;t already. I&#39;ve tried in the past to loose weight while I had undiagnosed hypothyroidism and it&#39;s ridiculously hard or even impossible.
