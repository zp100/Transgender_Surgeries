.! You have not seen the on my post about the butchering he did to me non 7/15/2019. This is a honest picture of what I saw  after  he unstapled  the bandages off my surgery area. Gross looking .!b He never came to my room after the surgery I had the nurses call him every day . 3 days I laid there going  crazy then on the night of the third day  he comes walking  up to my bed looks down and says hey I signed you out  you can go home now&gt; It was 9:30 PM I live 96miles from this Culver City  Hospital. The  proof is  I have a malpractice  case against him and his team  its been filed  may 5 2020. Please be care full , I will say this  he may not have  done the surgery on me which is a bad  thing to  have come out in  court But  I am a complete loss of why  this  was a mutalation of all my useful parts  I have  not  a female or  male  pat  left to work with so I am out for  blood. I just turned 70 and there isnt a big offer  for  revision  with nothing to start with. I wll check  my posts I hope  he hasn&#39;t found away to change the image ? He did it to my Yelp posting 6 months ago. Good Luck

Do you have a link to the lawsuit?
</p>
<p>
If you post images and they are hosted on reddit there’s no practical way for your surgeon to change them.

Probably is a link, I don&#39;t know I wouldn&#39;t know how you would make one with out giving some info  not intended for everyone. By   t he way it isn&#39;t my surgeon  moving the pictures Its Dr. Sin Clairs moderators he pays them to  change  ratings and lots of  those  kind of things like  the picture he took off my post in Yelp. Money buys anything.
</p>
<p>
I have given my testimonial , we are waiting  for  his to come up with in the next 30 days. I can hardly wait to look in his eyes and ask WHY !  But you know I have  some strange questions and also some info that I have been combing the internet for more truth to a persons text telling me that my surgery  is just like some he has seen that were for the  use  of my parts  for sale . Its the third or more  times  people have asked me was this what happened ?? I hope not but what else makes any sense? If you or anybody can give me a real link or name where I can personally see or get  info I will bring this into court I  promise.!!!

I didn&#39;t name  Reddit , as the  site that changes the pictures, but  Yelp gives the customers who pay a sum of  money  or a trade off of items  between them thats allowing  these  missing links to show up but go nowhere.??
</p>
<p>
Now about my LAWSUIT. ???YES IT IS ONGOING AS I SIT HERE AND TYPE. THERE ARE NO LINKS THAT I CAN USE TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF L.A. COUNTY ,..I will tell you that I have given my deposition 2 months ago and  we are waiting  for his lawyers to agree on a date for his to us. I am so unraveled of how the courts  set these times for any action to happen any faster, we are still getting the same excuse about the timing do to the damn Pandemic crap I am having  lots more issues that  are from this insane surgery 3 years last month 7/15/2019. These newer  things are involving
</p>
<p>
my hips being in the position they used  and setup  by untrained persons in my OR, these issues are getting more and more painful. and there&#39;s others.
</p>
<p>
I had to give in to the surgery  that I have had the most  painful and  just a unhealthy issue that has and is directly from his job on me ! Thats the part where I have been peeing on myself every time I going to the bathroom,  he or ? cut  my Urethra to short to make it out to the  edge of the cavern he left me with. After 3  surgeons  that I pleaded with to do revision
</p>
<p>
on me they all left me to sink with the damage. Like  Dr. Murice at Sini Medical he  took 8 months away from my life to set me up promising to  give me a vagina and  canal all the  things I have none of then in month 7 he turned in to being a straight out lier to me after 2 kat scans 2 colonoscopies  Setting up with his  team doctor  Dr Nassarie ** this isn&#39;t spelled
</p>
<p>
right*** he was a great surgeon knew his job looked over the surgery papers Murice  had  wrote up for  his part to bring the colon for the canal hes all good. Murice  filp and told me Quote&#34; I am NOT going to do the surgery  we made for you now! because I don&#39;t think you need it&#34; I went into a complete down lhill dive to hell after those words  were said to me sitting 2 feet from his face this was to be a PRE-OP visit. so think of how that would sound.
</p>
<p>
many more of this crack pot shit from Dr. Sin Clair Dr. Murice and others.
</p>
<p>
I did find the two great ladies that were the only  Doctors who said  they would go for it and so they did only the parts of the peeing on myself were addressed this first time surgery with them and that was 6/20/2022 I am under the believe that the women surgeons
</p>
<p>
GOING TO BE AS GOOD OR EVEN BETTER  IN THE. SRS, GRS SCS.  THINK ABOUT THAT THEY ARE MORE CLOSE TO THE PICTURE THAN MEN.

THANKS FOR HANGING AROUND I WILL BE  IN TILL THE END. TG. JILLIAN

I am so glad u brought up the UCLA health and Wellness Center  services they are the ones I went to already. Read my reply down the site here and your going the right way with them.
</p>
<p>
They are women and  know a woman&#39;s body parts much better than men, makes sense Huhh.?
</p>
<p>
OBGY and  Gastroenterologist  they are the only  doctors out of 3+ male doctors who were not so chicken to look at my mess and  said we will do it. the other doctors  just  made every  try at not calling themselves chicken . No guts Try talking to them you may take them on.
</p>
<p>
Good luck; TG. Jillian
