FTM, phalloplasty, several years ago.
</p>
<p>
I hadn‚Äôt considered that I would be the first/only post-phalloplasty patient my (primary care, mostly) doctors interacted with. Any questions or concerns I have about anything related to phallo are impossible for them to answer. I worry about emergencies or even routine procedures down the line where I might need a catheter inserted by someone who has never seen a urethra lengthened like mine. I am going to have to be the expert on my own body probably for the rest of my life, and not in a hip ‚Äúyou know yourself best‚Äù kind of way.
</p>
<p>
In a loose way, I knew this. But it took awhile for me understand what an ongoing mental challenge it all is.
</p>
<p>
My dysphoria is gone, though, so that‚Äôs cool.

Yep. I had a vaginoplasty, which I know is more common, but just this morning a public health nurse who was treating some hypergranulation for me said she was so happy to meet me and glad she &#34;got the chance&#34; to be the one to do it, because in 23 years as a nurse she&#39;d never actually seen a post-op vagina.

Cis medical professionals spend way too much time treating trans bodies as objects of curiosity. That&#39;s a fine thing for her to think, but what an unaware comment to actually say.

Yes, it definitely makes the patient feel like they&#39;re a weird outlier instead of just an ordinary person with a wound looking for basic care.  I wasn&#39;t bothered in this instance, but I can certainly see why someone might be ( I might be, another time).
</p>
<p>
Commenting unnecessarily on people&#39;s bodies is always a bad idea for health care providers (and in most other contexts too). Especially if it&#39;s their genitalia. And especially if the comment marks them as part of a vulnerable group! Multiple flags on the play.

During my hysterectomy consult, the surgeon told me about how sad she was that she ‚Äúnever got to see the girls after.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the only weird comment, but it was one of the weirder ones.
</p>
<p>
Might be an unpopular take, but I really wish the medical community would put some effort into training clinicians who can work with us long term, instead of ONLY recruiting clinicians to start us on HRT.

Mostly, how LOOOONG the recovery really is. We&#39;re told that after 3 months, we begin going back to normal... but that is where the marathon begins. With everything that it takes JUST to dilate, and the swelling not completely gone, just... uuugh, it was 6 months to a year before I felt actually recovered. Other than that, having pictures, and descriptions of what is &#34;
<em>
normal
</em>
&#34; would be great. You are always wondering, checking in the mirror, worried something isn&#39;t correct... some areas stay numb longer than others... my labia were numb longer than the clitoris... now though, I can feel EVERYTHING... and I instinctually know where the sensation is coming from... I&#39;m far more connected to my vagina and surrounding areas than I EVER was with my penis.

I don&#39;t know exactly... but I am 1 year and 8 months now... and sometimes I forget I ever had anything else. I have 5.5-6 inches depth, but get more out of a toy... and only dilate once a month now. Don&#39;t switch up without talking to your doc though... but really, most of the time I &#34;dilate&#34; I&#39;m actually having sex... so, it doesn&#39;t feel like the chore it did before.

Very similar to me. I will be 3 years on July 30th! Once a month at least with toys or maybe the green dilator (the orange is just too big), same depth as you. I can&#39;t tell what it was like before, I feel like my bottom has always been this way.

So hopefully this isn‚Äôt a gross question but like that‚Äôs a specific dilator tool and you can just leave it there while you‚Äôre asleep?

Sorry, I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll get to do this or what type but ‚Ä¶

I asked my doctor about 3 months into recover if I could do it overnight, since I kept falling asleep anyways.... and I just use panties to keep it in while I sleep... great time saver, and it allowed me to size up easier... since I move in my sleep it helped stretch things out a little more

I‚Äôve never had bottom surgery but from what I have read, you‚Äôll be dilating much than once a month for your first few months.  Not trying to be negative here.  Just saying to know the info in depth before diving into the deep end.  Lol, I guess that‚Äôs kind of a pun.

Let me say this. Few people have as much reason to bitch and moan about that process than me. This is nothing to brag about, but I earned every inch of my soapbox over the years.
</p>
<p>
So what I have found to be true for me, is that over time, there isn&#39;t anything that I would undo. Even with problems that sucked the life out of me for years, I was was able to heal and move on. Mind you, I have never been &#34;on the fence&#34; about surgery. Any of it. I see it as inevitable. Had I not done it I would have regretted it for the rest of my life. Life is not stagnant, we live and learn every single day.
</p>
<p>
I would hope that everyone who has surgery feels that way, but I know that&#39;s not the case. None of this is perfect no matter how much we hope for the best outcomes. We are all pushing boundaries here and if someone isn&#39;t up for that, they should think long and hard before messing with their biology. Otherwise, regret will eat you alive.

You know, I thought that way for 2 1/2 years. Then I stopped focusing on it and decided I couldn&#39;t keep doing the same thing everyday and expect my frame of mind to improve. It wasn&#39;t easy. Surprisingly, when I let it go and got back into a routine in a new environment, I met some great people. That was 4 years ago and now I just try to be as constructive as possible in this space for my trans community fix.

Yeah, also vaginas require so much more all around care. Even before with all the 1/2 tucking game and sitting everything .. just simple things like bathroom, bathing, and more.   I know know cis-women known this forever but it&#39;s brutal and not even dealing with whole fertility nightmares they do.
</p>
<p>
Also could told me that surgery aside , cis-women too that vagina just discharge. I thought it was something wrong after year and then start talking to cis-women and post trans-women alike researching.. yeah so damn tired of the slightly damp underwear.  I&#39;m pansexual but my vagina is fucking gross. The daily clean demands and smell is unreal.

I don&#39;t want myself around her much less another person you know minus the whole insane sex drive. My interest in men has picked up steam.

Mine didn&#39;t last forever. I&#39;m 15 months post-op Vulvaplasty and Inversion vaginoplasty. About the 8th month I started feeling everything again. However, I had these &#34;electric shocks&#34; as the nerves healed and remapped. They still happen once in a while, but it&#39;s manageable. Oh, and Sexual sensation is incredible and waaaaaay much better than before.

I&#39;m 14 months myself and I relate to alot this. Unfortunately in December I experienced contraction and I can no longer do dilator #1.  I can manage some very small dialators[not surgical ones] and my pelvic wand. So I figure PIV is off table for me for a good while at least. It&#39;s disheartening especially given that what normally very low to none existent drive is in full swing. I can really relate #3 and #5 good gracious. I almost immediately fell into depression, experienced a separation from my wife, job changes. Wife and I are working on bringing our family(daughter) back together, taking it slow.  Dilating 3-4 times a day for 10 months.. I just can&#39;t say how marathon draining the last 14 months have been in so many facets. I do some poor variation of dilation 3x week cause why not i guess. It&#39;s not just physical and the time. It&#39;s the brutal psychological and emotional aspects.  Even with complication still wouldn&#39;t take it back.  But there just so much unpack and figure out exhausting even w/o my relationship and job dramas on top everything.
</p>
<p>
The one thing that really helped in last month is just beginning to get over my hang-ups and masturbating. Although that has turned into endless void of self-discovery that too lazy, too busy(not really), and just physcho-emotionally ocerwhelmed to deal. Getting a wand has been game changer and honestly without it don&#39;t think anything would ever started working. Turns out everything changes the moment you start working it all out regularly. Although can&#39;t say really feel up to it.I can relate with #2 a little but don&#39;t have any physicality with anyone so not sure. My thing is that I&#39;m going positively insane with need .. yes some sense orgasm is happening.. but it&#39;s like incomplete while at sametime I feel more comfortable with my body as a whole. I just kinda feel absorbed, confussed, and wantimg to ignore my vagina. She just refuses so much care is needed and she doesn&#39;t allow me forget she&#39;s there annoying with moments of joy sometimes. Super insecure about my vagina but happy to be rid of prior anatomy and there some comfort just having her flaws and all. She&#39;s ugly in my opinion but like ugly pug you can&#39;t help but love. It&#39;s like I exchanged this disconnect for ocean of emotions and unfamiliar feelings. Confusion and desire to just not think about her for day wouId be nice. I use could rid myself of occasional urge pushing weeks or months between and nonexistent w/ hormones pre-surgery in a single episode go about my life. Now, regardless of if I make orgasm or not it&#39;s back instantly. Nothing tames it.. every move, blow of air, and unexpected movement brings attention to endless need. I&#39;m going absolutely insane.. I do almost anything for off switch.
</p>
<p>
Turns out cis-women experience having to realign themselves with their sexuality in phases in their life too having to refind their body. But because this so new and different it&#39;s abit more brutal. Learning to drive a car was easier üòÄ.  I talk a good deal with older lifestyle cis-women who has really helped be resounding board for these brutal thoughts and feelings that just too much.
</p>
<p>
Just got figure this out and learn be okay with self pleasure.. ugh just hate the existence of the need at all. Spent my life so focused on others.. I find pleasure a little repulsive and it&#39;s going to take time. Give myself grace .. guess thats my new life challenge.. on path to true authenticity and self-love.

Sorry, does vaginoplasty mean 0 depth? Exactly what kind of surgery technique is that? (E.g. penile inversion, etc)

Burnout from recovery, absolutely. I&#39;m at just 12 weeks or so and it&#39;s already really wearing me down.  I&#39;m back to work full time and I have a kid, so dilations are bedtime and first thing in the morning, bracketing minimal sleep, with an extra one in mid-afternoon... Can&#39;t wait till the 3-month mark when I can go down to 2/day!

I was shocked at how easily I psychologically felt so at home.  I was shocked that I have not once had even the faintest memory of what was there before.  Yes, recovery is hard, but it absolutely feels natural and I had feared there would be a kind of adjustment period mentally to getting comfortable with the new anatomy.  Not at all.  It was literally plug and play.  MTF, 3 years post-op.

If you‚Äôre anything like I was, literally from the moment I woke up after surgery, aside from the discomfort of healing and the first few weeks of dilating, I honestly can‚Äôt recall what having the other thing was like at all, even to the point where I just find them odd and don‚Äôt know how they work on men.  It‚Äôs weird, but there it is.

Get everything in writing, and don&#39;t trust anyone that can&#39;t show pictures of previous work.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon (Morrison/Skokan, UW Seattle) promised in consultation to work hard to reach my goals of normal inner labia and worked up a plan to reach those goals and discussed it extensively. Only after surgery did they explain they&#39;re bad at it and decided to make exceedingly small ones instead, &#34;since my results usually efface anyway&#34;. And rather than being all in on helping me, he now thinks I &#34;look better [with no inner labia] anyway.&#34;
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s pretty damn terrifying to hear for the first time postop.
</p>
<p>
References and recommendations are fine, but mistakes here are hard to fix. Make sure your surgeon can actually do what they promise.

They&#39;re both listed on the
<a href="https://depts.washington.edu/tgnbhealthprogram/provider_type/vulvovaginoplasty/">UW Medical page for feminizing bottom surgery
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thankful I&#39;m basically healthy (urologically and all), and I&#39;m thankful they left enough material that I can probably salvage this to some extent. I&#39;m told a lot of their patients are happy with results. I just feel very violated and lied to, as this is not what I consented to.

The smells is a big one for me. I only got my GRS on July 3rd, but I was surprised by the smell. After surgery, you&#39;re healing a wound, and wounds and old blood are smelly. I was really worried something had gone wrong until the nurses told me everything was normal and I was healing really well.

That definitely improves with time. I want to say it was around 6 weeks mine started shifting more towards normal vulva smell. It also helps if you have a way to get a normal vulva fauna going, but I hear from others that will also happen in time even without help.

The one thing I wish I knew it was that I should wait for the best surgeon and not the one closest to me covered by my insurance. I thought I was making a good decision and I goofed. Ironically, the doctor that fixed me up was only about a 5 hour drive from me and also covered by my insurance. I am horrified by the amount of people I see on here who rush into surgery with doctors they‚Äôve never heard of, or who even plan on having revisions later on purpose because they can‚Äôt get into their dream doctor in the next two months. Ditto on people who refuse to have hair removal because it hurts or they just don‚Äôt feel like it. Fortunately, I am in a good place now but it took several corrective procedures and a lot of extra money to get me there and I urge people not to make those mistakes that I did.
</p>
<p>
Even with these problems, I have zero regrets about the surgery itself and would never, ever go back. It‚Äôs hard to remember what it was like before. Were it not for the fact that my insurance is covering some facial surgery I probably wouldn‚Äôt even be on here to be honest. Things feel totally natural, I blend in fine, and people don‚Äôt treat me differently or with suspicion or anything like that. I am really puzzled by some of the strange comments I see on here because I haven‚Äôt had any of the problems people talk about.

7 days post-op minimal depth: the bolster itself is really painful. I had it on for seven days and  as I moved around more and more, the stitches were were really irritating my skin. The last few nights I could barely sleep. Luckily having the bolster removed wasn‚Äôt very painful.  And as others have mentioned, recovering is incredibly energy zapping. I can‚Äôt imagine also dilating. And I‚Äôm glad I took a few weeks off of work.
</p>
<p>
I can still feel the nerves where my dick and scrotum were. They just feel like they‚Äôre still in the exact same spot.

I have wanted to pee like a woman my entire life, literally. I think I‚Äôll be happier when its more of a stream and not so messy to clean up around my stitches.

I wish I knew about how sensations would change, about other surgical techniques like PPV, and that not every doctor makes labia minora and you have to ask.

Just to caution bc it happened to me: I asked, he said he would, and then he didnt because &#34;it looks great this way [without]&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d recommend demanding photos to make sure they arent flat out lying about what they can do.

Great point! You should always ask for photos; to me it‚Äôs a red flag if a surgeon won‚Äôt show prior work.

I got shallow depth but eventually found that extremely pleasurable sensations inside my vagina and outside my vulva made me want full depth.

Transfem: (Suporn method)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
even knowing logically how long recovery would be, its not something you can truly know until you are living it. at almost 6 months post op, i don&#39;t feel like i have anything close to a life back yet. i spend about as much time dilating (maybe more. i lost interest deligently tracking my time-to-depth after 4 months) as i did my first month post-op. when recovery gets to be this long, it no longer feels like you are healing. it instead feels like ground hog day, always &#34;recovering&#34; but never healing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
i checked with my pcp before surgery to make sure she would be willing to take over pain management when i returned. i mentioned dilation pain management would be a several months affair, and she was like oh no worries etc... i wish i had had more assurances or a backup option as, by month 2 she was wanting to start having conversations about coming off my pain management regimen and by month 4 i was fighting tooth and nail to keep my pain management. not only for my measley tramadol, but she became adamanet about reducing me off of celebrex and wanted me to reduce to 2g paracetemol a day... i saw the writing on the wall and had to find a new dr to take over pain management by month 5, but i have lost more than an inch of depth due to inadequate pain management dilating during my hunt for a new dr to take over pain management and had to resort to trying kratom for a few weeks. i wish that i had made sure that her assurances i would be taken care of for dilation pain were a sincere commitment and not her blowing me off pre-op and not realizing the extent of what recovery would look like.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
i wish i had known how alone i would feel. i would say i have had a (imo much) greater than average recovery difficulty. i have gotten a uti every month since month 2, which for me has always included urethral swelling and tenderness adding to dilation difficulties. during the peak of my inadequate pain management i was also at the peak of a uti and my time-to-depth was 4 to 5 hours per dilation. for at least a month maybe 2 dilation became literally my life and i did almost nothing else. i have felt alienated from not only the people in my life that i no longer have time or energy for, but i have even felt alienated from my surgery cohort. not that my cohort has done anything to make me feel that way, but i don&#39;t know anyone else recovering alongside me who has shared my difficulty, and it has made me feel very alone.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
in my week of hospital bed recovery directly following surgery, i was given 2mg clonazapam consistently by the nurses along with my meds. i had never had benzos before and didn&#39;t know anything about it (idk that i even knew i was taking it at the time), but what i know now is that benzos cause ubiquitous amnesia for me while i am on them. my entire week of hospital recovery is a blackout for me. no memory of anything. i posted to twitter, had deep conversations with loved ones on discord, etc throughout the week, and reading them back later was like reading them for the first time. if i had known what i know now i would have requestes not to have benzos. i have very fond memories of how happy i was immediately following ffs, and based on my messages i had a similar experience of joy following srs. but i am sad to say i dont have those fond memories for srs bc i simply don&#39;t remembed any of it.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>
this is a lot of negativity so i want to add that knowing what i know now, i absolutely would do it over again. i am still over the moon with my results even with my hardships. my peaks are worth my troughs ‚ù§Ô∏è

So they did shift post op for you? I know people say they get the female o prior to surgery from strictly hormones but I am going on 2.5 years HRT and I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve gotten there.

I got my GRS on July 3rd, so I&#39;m really just in the beginnings of things. But the energy drain is because of how much care you need. For the first few days you&#39;re drained because you just had a major surgery, and after that you&#39;re drained because of the time commitment. With vaginoplasty with canal, you need to dilate 4 times a day for the first month. Each of those 4 times is 30 minutes, plus about 15-20 minutes of icing beforehand if youre swollen, plus about 60 minutes of cleaning and aftercare. It&#39;s about 8 hours a day just dilating for the first month, plus your body being tired already because so much of its energy is going right into recovery. I don&#39;t regret a thing, I have been so much happier looking at my body since I woke up after the surgery, but it does make you REALLY tired.

Woww I knew I‚Äôd have to dilate 4x a day but I didn‚Äôt realize it would add up to 8 hours with the cleaning involved too. That does sound so exhausting. I‚Äôm scared about cleaning and dilating the first week I don‚Äôt even want to look at it. I think looking at it might take me out in itself, so yucky. I guess this is why they‚Äôre making me take 2 months off.

Yeah you don&#39;t really realize the time commitment until you&#39;re actually in it, and then you realize how tough it is. Like I&#39;m happy I did it, but I would really enjoy having my days back to be able to do stuff other than dilate xD Honestly for looking, I thought that would be a problem for me too, but you kind of get used to it really quickly. You don&#39;t need to look at it any more than you personally want to. Like where I&#39;m also squeamish about blood, I look at it through a mirror when I&#39;m putting the dilator in, but then once it&#39;s in, I just lay back and wait for my timer to go off.

Mostly yeah! I&#39;m able to walk and climb stairs pretty easily, but with the swelling I&#39;m definitely still doing more of a penguin walk than walking normally. But I&#39;m definitely able to get around by myself without too much trouble

Hey! As a trans woman waiting for the SRS, I want to say: THANK YOU SO MUCH to all of you for sharing your experiences! This is very helpful for mental preparing! And I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good to read enough about the &#34;negative things&#34;, too. Not for questioning my decision, I&#39;m pretty sure that none of these aspects could be able to get me deciding against this surgery. But spending time on reading and thinking about all that stuff will help me confirm my decision! Like &#34;Even though I know it will be a hard and long time of recovery etc., I&#39;m still sure I want that surgery&#34; is so much better than not thinking about it and then getting doubts about it short before surgery. As well, the fact that so many of you wrote that you are not perfectly 100% happy with everything but still it was the right decision, you don&#39;t regret and would have regretted later if you hadn&#39;t gone through the surgery ‚Äì that also encourages me.  So thank you for sharing your very helpful experiences! :)

The whole medical community seem to be unaware and careless of your mere existence.
</p>
<p>
Just because you have now a neovagina, they suddenly forget ALL what they learnt in university,  leaving you helpless.
</p>
<p>
Women who know of my Vaginoplasty, started to act weirder than before when I&#39;m around,  as if they disprove me as a woman.  Not all but the majority.  They feel &#34;challenged&#34;. They suck at being a woman and I noticed my presence triggers their insecurities.

Hiii! I may be able to put some kind of input here! As a transgirl maybe 2 years away from having bottom surgery, I would like to put my input into what the problem is with the preparation process for this surgery. For all the articles I&#39;ve read, its very hard to get in with a good surgeon to perform your bottom surgery. My goal is to go with the Suporn clinic in Thailand but it is a 2 year waitlist. I wish I understood my current transgender insurance coverage better, so I wouldn&#39;t have to pay out of pocket for everything. I&#39;ll probably be going to Seoul South Korea for Voice Feminization Surgery, but not much is known about that too.

No problem! I know Reddit is funky sometimes, and if I were in your shoes I&#39;d want someone to tell me.
