Very comprehensive and helpful - I have been genuinely curious about patient care at KU Med since I used to live in the area too (although I am not planning to have surgery there)

Thanks for sharing! This was a great write up and if you do decide to share pictures, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™d all love to see them.  I was curious about KU med as I used to live near there. I still have (retired) family in the area that would take care of me after surgery if I asked them to.  Iâ€™ll be looking at whatâ€™s available here in the PNW but it is good to know I have a fallback option.

Thank you so much for posting about your experience. I hadnâ€™t found much about KU Med here on Reddit and as someone who is heavily considering going through KU, this was very helpful and reassuring to me. I hope that your recovery continues to go well!

Thank you so much for this post! My partner (30 mtf) is currently in surgery with this team and her experience has been pretty similar in regard the pre-op. I am hoping that she will have a similar post op as well. Thank you again for posting this, it has helped relieve some of the anxiety of waiting for updates. ðŸ’œ
