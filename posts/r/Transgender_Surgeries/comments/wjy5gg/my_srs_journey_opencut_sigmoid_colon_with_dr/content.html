I am currently 3 weeks post-op and this is how my magical journey begin. This is an unbiased journaling of what I experienced, and is more for me as a reminder in the future than anything. Also, I am not the best at writing so if you have a hard time understanding what I’m expressing, I’m really sorry.

<strong>
Before Everything
</strong>
<br>
I’ve been planning for my SRS since December 2020, I would casually scroll through Reddit researching about the options I have available to me and one hospital and one technique stuck out most: Sigmoid colon graft. However, most surgeon have a BMI restriction of &lt;25 and I was 33 at that point of time. Knowing my weight was one of the obstacles I needed to overcome in order to be eligible for SRS, I reached out to my endocrinologist in regards to what could be done to help with the situation. I was referred to a weight specialist and overtime with different methods I managed to lose a lot of excess weight and change my eating habits.
</p>
<p>
SRS no longer felt like something I could not reach for, hence I jumped back on Reddit to research more about the hospital.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Siam Transformative
</strong>
<br>
Reading through multiple reviews I wasn’t very confident with my initial hospital of choice, that’s when I found Siam Transformative. What stood out to me was how many people on Reddit genuinely adore Becky, Cherry and Saphira of Siam Transformative. They seem rather low-key as compared to other hospital and doctors being reviewed on Reddit but they seem to have a good grasp on quality and the service they provide.
</p>
<p>
I was planning to travel to Bangkok for SRS all alone but knowing that I do not speak a word of Thai and not being the most attentive person to things/surrounding, I know I really needed a hospital/agency that could provide me with a translator and some sort of package that would take care of me.
</p>
<p>
So I casually emailed them and within an hour or two I got a reply and things happened so quickly because I just felt so at ease. I’ve always been a little type-a, I needed to know everything ahead and Saphira was so patient and attentive to the things I asked for, she basically listed out everything dollars and cents and the what and where. It was what I needed, I needed everything to be taken care of for me. It just felt right.
</p>
<p>
Next thing I know I was sending pictures for Dr. Thee’s review and securing a date for surgery. Everything happened so smoothly, and it’s all thanks to Saphira, I remember rushing to a dinner appointing at 8pm and she was still answering my inquiries through email, on a weekend might I add.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Prep Work
</strong>
<br>
Preparing for surgery I was given a preparation list for surgery; medical reports, psychiatrist letter (locally and in Bangkok), do’s and don’ts. I was also advised to stop any HRT 4~6 weeks prior of surgery to prevent DVT (deep vein thrombosis). After Dr. Thee reviewed the pictures of my genital, I was also advised to go through 1-2 more sessions of hair removal in certain areas.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of preparing this documents, Becky was arranging for my accommodation. I was fortunate enough to have my sister and some friends come visit me through the duration I was in Bangkok and Becky was really helpful with trying to find accommodation that would fit me and my sister, and also accommodation that would be near me for my friends
<em>
(my friends ended up getting their own accommodation since it’s also a mini holiday for them but Becky really gave different options for them to choose from)
</em>
. After putting down my deposit, securing a date, I booked my air ticket and gave Becky all the details on when I’m arriving.
</p>
<p>
Also! Have clean bare nails! No pedicure or manicure! I was told by Cherry that the hospital is very strict because the need to attach an oximeter on both finger and toe throughout the long surgery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Arriving in Bangkok
</strong>
<br>
I was asked to add Saphira on Facebook messenger and was adding into a group chat with Becky and Cherry, from there we communicated on the time I’ll be landed and at which exit they would be picking me up from. Communication was always open, if I had any queries they would be answered. I never felt lost. Also because I had roaming and could access the internet immediately when I landed.
</p>
<p>
By time I cleared immigration and collecting my luggage it was already 8PM, so I made my way to the exit Becky told me they were at and the lovely Cherry helped me load my luggage into the car and we then drove to my accommodation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Lumpini Park Nawamin - Sri Burapha
</strong>
<br>
I told Becky that I needed to get some supplies before we get to the condo and we drove to a 7-11 nearby to get some water and other toiletries. Soon after we arrived at the lovely condo, which is very secure, with a very well stock 7-Eleven and many amenities like pool, gym, library, hair/nail salon, laundromat, self-service coin laundry etc.
</p>
<p>
I had a few days before my scheduled surgery to do some sightseeing (which I do really recommend). There were so many things to do and you could travel anywhere with a ride service like Grab. I did so much shopping, went to the premium outlet mall, CentreWorld, Siam Paragon, checked out some pastry place my sister recommended etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Meeting Dr. Thee
</strong>
<br>
During the few free days prior to surgery, Becky had arranged for me to see a local psychiatrist in Bangkok to get clearance for SRS (it’s mandatory in Thailand). She &amp; Cherry picked me up from my accommodation (I was doing some shopping prior) and we arrived at Praram 9 Hospital. Becky was very sweet to let me know that the psychiatrist would ask some “insensitive” questions but it’s all out of formality for medical clearance (questions like do I have a boyfriend, when did I know I wanted to be a girl, am I aware it’s not reversible and if I wanted kids and if I know that I cannot biologically have kids etc). The psychiatrist visit was actually quite pleasant, it was not imposing at all and we got it done rather quickly. I was then transported back to my condo and did my own thing for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
On another day, I was brought to a clinic to have my Covid test done. Before we drove to another clinic where Dr. Thee was to have a physical consultation, Becky and Cherry brought me to this night market to have dinner. They had the most amazing beef soup, it was amazing. We then headed to the clinic which was just beside the night market. Dr. Thee was really soft spoken and not intimidating at all. There wasn’t much of a language barrier between us when we made small talk to make me feel more comfortable and at ease before being asked to take off my bottoms to inspect the genital. Because I lost a significant amount of weight, I have a lot of loose skin to which Dr. Thee informed me that if I ever consider having a tummy tuck I should be aware and let the surgeon know that I’ve had SRS because that would pull up and change the placement of my vulva (who knew?? So glad he told me!).
</p>
<p>
During the consultation I was also asked about the goal of my SRS, how do I want it to look, functionality etc. My main concern has always been having a bulge when wearing tight fitting clothes so for me so long it is functional and relatively “good looking” I’m cool with how it would turn out. We then spoke about the technique I want and we came down to what I wanted which was an open-cut sigmoid colon graft.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery Time!
</strong>
<br>
The day before the surgery I was told to take a laxative pill at 7AM and then we arrive at MALI Interdisciplinary Hospital around 1PM and had my blood drawn, EGC and blood pressure taken. I had a very nice and spacious private ward to myself with a very large bathroom and wide screen TV. I was given my last meal before surgery at 5PM and was also given 2 huge pitchers of laxative to drink before 9PM. Somewhere in between all that I was given my first enema. Dr. Thee did come and personally check on me prior to the surgery to ask how was everything.
</p>
<p>
The day of the surgery was given the second and last enema to flush out everything. By 3/4PM I was told I would be transported to the operating room and everything happened really quickly from there on. I was told to sign a consent form and after lying down and verifying my details I was told to breathe into this oxygen mask and bam I was out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 1 Post-Op
</strong>
<br>
I remember waking up in my ward and the first thing I saw was my lower body being wrapped up, so instantly I knew, ah it’s done. Reyanne, the private nurse from Siam Transformative greeted me and asked me if I was feeling alright. I remember being numb but feeling pain from both the surgery site and my left foot. My left foot was really numb as though I sat on it for awhile and was left with pins and needles that wouldn’t go away. Reyanne would then constantly give me foot rubs to ease the pain.  When I was fully up and conscious the pain kicked in, all I remember was being in so much pain I was constantly moaning for painkillers. I kept asking Reyanne to go ask for painkillers for me even though it was not time yet for another dose.
</p>
<p>
I remember being extremely phlegmy and I couldn’t really breathe because of the angle I was laying down. I couldn’t really cough as I felt like I could burst my open-cut wound as it felt really tender still but finally after much struggle and encouraging words from Becky, I manage to cough out most of the phlegm. The whole week stay in the hospital was a blur for me, I was in so much pain and was really homesick.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Big Reveal
</strong>
<br>
On the last day of my hospital stay, Becky and Cherry visited me before Dr. Thee and his team came to unwrap me and check my newly constructed coochie. The draining tube and catheter was removed. Becky took a picture a showed me the result, telling me it was still swollen but to me, it looked beautiful in all it’s swollen glory. It looks like a coochie, a real coochie!
</p>
<p>
I was then given my first solid food meal, very yummy pumpkin with eggs by the way. Was told that I could only be discharged if I could pee twice and soon after I was getting dressed and being driven back to the condo with the help of Becky and Cherry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recharge, Recover, Recovery
</strong>
<br>
Not going to lie, recovery was hard. I was alone most of the time. Getting up was a struggle and laying back down was a feat. I honestly couldn’t have done it if not for Cherry coming twice and day to bring me food and drinks and also to help me clean and dress my wound. Day by day I got encouragement from Becky and Cherry and day by day I felt better. The first week out of hospital was still really hard. I missed my family, I thought I was independent, I thought it was a rite of passage for transwomen to go through SRS alone and I was disappointment at myself for feeling like a failure because I couldn’t do this alone whilst many could.
</p>
<p>
Things slowly got better, I would call my father and sister constantly. My amazing best friends would call and video call to me make sure I was okay. We would talk for hours and things really started to feel a lot better. I started feeling better because of all the fruits and smoothies Cherry would bring me, the antibiotic were working, I put my ego aside and just looked forward to recovering and feeling better.
</p>
<p>
Going to the toilet got easier, the initial burning pain from peeing got better (blisters from the stitches rubbing together), I was never constipated, if anything, poop flew out of me constantly. The tightness of my bikini line wound got better, I couldn’t stand up straight at first but by the second week post-op I was all good.
</p>
<p>
I had two follow-up appointments with Dr. Thee at the Interplast clinic, one was to remove and add some stitches to my wound, one for dilating. Everything went really smoothly and I was given the clearance by Dr. Thee to go home.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
And Just Like That
</strong>
<br>
The time has come to go home, it was a bittersweet moment. I’ve grown attached to Becky and Cherry over the 3 weeks I was there, and they have taken really good care of me. They drove me to the airport and helped with my luggages. We hugged and said our good byes. They told me this is the beginning of my new journey, a new journey I would start back home.
</p>
<p>
And just like that, a new version of me begins.

After my initial consultation through email, Dr. Thee recommended open incision over laparoscopic because “I did not have lots of tissue to work with”. I think it just meant I had a small…you know, haha. I did not mind the scar and it was significantly cheaper so yay to that.

Oh ok, and was Colon always the first choice? How has your digestive system been since? You hear such diffeeent reports about the Colon method. Some even really advocate against it. I&#39;m still deciding which one to go with.

Colon was my initial choice, then I read up about peritoneal and decided that colon was still best suited for me. My digestive system has been fine since post-op, the only issue is that I kept pooping very frequently. I’m only 3 weeks post-op so my system is still adapting but everyday I feel better, I can already feel it calming down.

Also if you don’t mind me asking how much did it cost? And does he do other types of surgery like jejunum? And how dangerous is the area where the hospital and condo are?

They could stay with you in the condo, that isn’t a problem! My sister stayed with me and my friends visited me daily when they were there. I’m not sure about the jejunum technique as I’ve never read much about it so I can’t comment. The area around the condo is really chill, it did not feel dangerous at all, in fact at no point during my time in Bangkok did I feel unsafe. During your hospital stay I don’t think you’re allowed to leave the hospital so I can’t comment on the area outside of the hospital. During my recovery I stayed within my condo because I had difficulties walking for long period of time and I did not need anything outside of my condo, I could get it delivered to my condo.
</p>
<p>
the cost of the surgery + after care was about SGD17.5k

Hello, this was a very good write up! I&#39;m looking to get this procedure with Dr. Theerapong and was wondering how you were feeling a few months after. I&#39;m wondering about lubrication and sensation once things have healed. I&#39;m also interested in the post-op dilation once you&#39;ve returned home (how long and how frequently it needs to be done) and how you&#39;ve dealt with follow on care from your doctor after returning, if applicable. If you&#39;d rather DM me your response, that&#39;s ok too!
</p>
<p>
EDIT: One last question, how far in advance did you book? I&#39;m looking to book now for May/June 2024 and hoping that it&#39;s far enough in the future that I shouldn&#39;t need to worry about waiting lists and such.

Alright let’s go through each point one by one!
</p>
<p>
1) I’m currently 28 weeks post-op (about 6 months 13 days to be exact) and I’m feeling great! Not going to lie, the pain and discomfort only completely went away around the 5 months mark for me.
</p>
<p>
2) Lubrication is great! Currently I’m able to dilate without much resistance with no lube using soul source dilator #1. When I got home I diligently did 1 hour of dilation everyday, however I got covid back in October and didn’t dilate for a week, had a little bit of resistance but eventually after 3-4 days it was fine again.  They recommend that I dilate half an hour twice a day or an hour a day.
</p>
<p>
3) Sensation wise, I haven’t really explored so I can’t give a respond yet but yes I do feel things and sensitivity in that area.
</p>
<p>
4) Siam Transformative is very responsive on Facebook messenger, I felt like a problem child after I got back home because I was so unsure of all the things happening and I kept asking Becky and Cherry for advice on how to deal with e.g wound pain, cleaning, etc. They are amazing and they’ve been very helpful.
</p>
<p>
5) I reached out in June and got an appointment in July, because I asked if there was an opening during that window. I’m sure you can reach out now and let them know your ideal appointment date.

Thank you very much for telling us about your experience, I wish you a very good and calm recovery, it makes me more comfortable with my decision to have my SRS with Siam Transformative (but not with Dr. Teerapong, it would be with Dr. Sutin with the PPT technique)

I left Bangkok 2.5 weeks post-op, they recommend that you get someone at the airport to help with your luggage and get a wheelchair for you, however I did none of that because I wanted to shop around at the duty-free (it was a little tiring and I actually do not recommend lol). But yes, slow walking and not lifting heavy things is fine, I had an open-cut at the bikini area so I could feel the tension when I carried things that were too heavy.

I had Sigmoid colon revision and it works well finally but my issue is “Still” cosmetically doesn’t cut it really - he did a little bit , not much quite frankly - I feel I have enough tissue for labia minora but the entrance still looks like a butt hole , nothing redeeming to brag about really - he tried to stitch from the outside and neither distinguishing stitch held and labia was not pulled down into place either So ?, looks like nothing was done really and crooked as hell still , it needed to be done deep inside to achieve the results I wanted , you don’t need to be a surgeon to see this ! And I never got a real consult one on one without being interfered from a certain person with the service company I used and he speaks apparently good English ?
</p>
<p>
I felt from the git go the crotch needed to be completely opened up like a 1 st time SRS surgery maybe between minora and majora to really fix this mess and hide scars and adjust all the skin pull it into place hard core but never had a proper consult - So now I’m in a situation wanting a revision on a revision from the original surgery done by Kamol a gong show going on  over there ?
</p>
<p>
Can’t get this done where I live , have to travel again obviously and the cost would still kick the crap out of 12k Canadian not including flight ?
</p>
<p>
I needed a second hard core aesthetic surgery 10 days later after the Sigmoid colon was done and communication has totally dried up with Interplast ?
</p>
<p>
I think my chances are very limited going back to Theerapong as given the culture of offense is taken if your not happy and I don’t think I’m being over picky either , it’s fixable but there’s a but ? - a proper consult would have solved this but never got one last November 2022 , now what ?

How long was recovery for the sigmoid revision? How long did you stay in Bangkok?

I&#39;m post Op almost 2 years , The Sigmoid worked great for me but was a long surgery 11 hours and a blood transfusion to boot - I was 64 at the time and just wanted to be fully  functional despite age and I am ! and about 7 1/2 inches deep using the Large Orange Soul Source dilator once at this point every 10 days - I stayed 30 days.
</p>
<p>
I have no physical post op problems - all works but beware of Becky - stay away from her all I can say !! - my website explains here (
<a href="https://siamtransformation.com" rel="nofollow">https://siamtransformation.com
</a>
) It will explain a lot of the &#34;BS&#34; going on at the time with me being there 2022 late fall ! I took the Website name she scooped originally called (Siamtransformative) where she stole patient money from others etc. and not letting a person talk to to Dr. Theerpong to myself and others keeping a person ignorant to scam scoop more - a Law suite is in its working - she may end up in a Thai Jail - who would have a surgery like this and never talk to the surgeon 1 St as a sit down interview - all I got was a physical the day before nothing else - beware of this Snake in the grass !!!!
</p>
<p>
Deal with Meredith ( Armani ) who also lives in Bangkok - and you won&#39;t have issues pre or post op !

You can but ? the front staff doesn&#39;t speak English and slow as hell responding to the email let alone phone - There&#39;s 2 clinics actually - Meredith won&#39;t screw you over  , better having a liason who goes there in person and arranges all that&#39;s needed and a proper chat with Theerpong etc.
</p>
<p>
Avoid Becky the scammer - she somehow has her name on his web phone system online - she does not work for Theerpong in anyway - stay away from her !!!!
</p>
<p>
The clinic is downtown close to the Mali Hospital and where Meredith lives - Becky is shady as hell and lives on the outskirts of Bangkok - always brutal traffic and she&#39;s naturally lazy to drive you back if there&#39;s any issues post op - Trust me I know what&#39;s needed !

I don&#39;t know these two ( Lan or Ploy )  actually ? Just a quick background &#34;Becky&#34; grew up in Bangkok as a Caucasian child and her Dad was a US Kernel at a US Military Base and Becky learned perfect reading/writing skills during the early Vietnam era early to mid 60&#39;s -  She married a Thai man over 40 years ago and  in life traveling back and forth US and Thailand and picked up a skill as a Respiratory Therapist - she&#39;s not a trained surgical nurse - Since the demise of ( Siamtransformative ) pretty much 2 years ago she started using the none legit registry name in Bangkok called ( Siamtransformation  ) - it&#39;s a fake company she&#39;s not a registered company in Thaland to do what&#39;s she&#39;s doing for patient care in any way !!
</p>
<p>
She has a vehicle SUV and really is nothing more than Taxi Driver - ( Siamtransformative ) was started by 2 Transwomen originally - Not Becky !! - one of which was employed by NIST International School who is running a legit company to help Transwomen called ( Amani ) .
</p>
<p>
The connection of Becky appears to have started because of ( Covid 2020 ) Meredith at the NIST School was not working ( lost her job in Covid ) So ? and somehow got together with Becky unfortunately and started ( Siamtransformative ) because Becky had the reading/writing skills for easy communication this was great initially , but early on started scamming against her partner ( Meredith also known as Saphira ) in the business and patients scouping money and cheating .
</p>
<p>
Meredith prior worked in South Korea for about 5 years - not her 1 st kick at the can in a foreign country as a teacher - Covid forced a new employment need so the connection was made to help Transwomen in Bangkok.
</p>
<p>
Becky is not trained and her main helper at my time ( Nurse Cherry ) was not legally  entitled to work in Thailand as a Nurse 2022 and were not legally certified medically ( allowed by Thai Law) to do aftercare either one of them for Post op patients in Thailand ! but did it anyways - many lies to her partner Meredith going on at the time I was there 2022 late fall time.
</p>
<p>
Becky&#39;s ( 65 now ) her son was murdered in the US doing a drug deal apparently - tells me a lot about her family  living and traveling between the 2 countries - she has a small Pension in Texas working basically in an  Old Folks Home being a Respiratory Therapist some years ago - certainly not as a Surgical Nurse for Post op Transgender needs by a long shot with &#34;0&#34; skills !
</p>
<p>
Becky has a house owned by her husband on the downtown outskirts in Bangkok - this is why she wants patients to rent a B&amp;B apartment barely a 1/2 block away from her house to avoid driving - pure Lazy - and is dangerous for the patient Post op SRS  !!  I know a lot more - Just beware of all this crap with Becky !!!!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll add Becky is a CIS born woman and Meredith is Transgender woman who knows all the needs Post op - very important in comparison of needed skills dealing with Surgery !
