Does anyone have any experience with  Dartmouth-Hitchcock in New Hampshire?
</p>
<p>
They are supposed to be the best hospital in my state, and they are the only hospital that will do bottom surgery in my state. I have a consultation with Dr. Nigriny in a few weeks (was supposed to be tomorrow, but they double booked) to discuss vaginoplasty. I&#39;ve already had an orchi last year (pre-pandemic) at my local hospital (which is almost 3 hours away from Dartmouth-Hitchcock). I&#39;m hoping to get the surgery done this year.
</p>
<p>
Thoughts?

Hi! I actually had an orchi with Dr Moses at DH. I can&#39;t comment on Dr Nigriny personally, but in general my experience with the trans care clinic at DH has been exceptional and very respectful. I definitely trust the people that I have worked with there - Moses, Sturgiss, and Boh, who has left now. Full disclosure I considered getting FFS with Dr Shin for a second but I wasn&#39;t able to find any reviews or former patients of his - I think Boh told me before he left DH that Shin wasn&#39;t experienced at FFS at all.
</p>
<p>
I hope that helps somewhat. Do you have any other specific questions?

It&#39;s been just over a year post-orchie for me with Moses too, no complications and very minimal pain that was manageable. I&#39;m super curious how well Nigriny does for vaginoplasty as I&#39;m hoping to get that next.
