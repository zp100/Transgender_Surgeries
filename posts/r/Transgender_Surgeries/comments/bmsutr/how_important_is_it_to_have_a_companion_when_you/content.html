One of the two places I&#39;m considering going is Argentina. However, if my wife accompanies me, we have to bring our 11 year old son along...and the fact is that there just isn&#39;t anything that he&#39;s too interested in seeing in or around Buenos Aires.
</p>
<p>
It would be a bit different in Spain, since there&#39;s some European history he&#39;s interested in, especially WW2 related.  However, the cost of going to Facial Team is going to be significantly higher than going to Dr. Rossi.
</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m not so worried about that...but more, if I do go to Argentina by myself, am I going to really regret not having someone along?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m an introvert...I&#39;m totally fine with being by myself. It&#39;s more the recovery aspect I&#39;m concerned with.

I&#39;d say that for me, having a companion was really important.
</p>
<p>
My dad came along and helped with everything for a week after I was released from the hospital (I love him to bits). It&#39;s really, really difficult to drag yourself around while you feel like a dump truck ran over your face. Having someone to grab something for you, throw together basic meals, make phone calls for you, and to help you wash your wounds (especially if you have a subhairline incision for your forehead) will make an enormous difference. I can&#39;t recommend it more.
</p>
<p>
That said... you could do it. You&#39;d just have to be really fucking tough, and deal with a lot of stress around the time when relaxing in bed is actually important for you. If you have any complications sneak up on you and no one is there to help... doesn&#39;t sound fun.
</p>
<p>
Take someone if you can. It turns a grueling ordeal into a wait - an uncomfortable and painful one, but just a wait.

During the first few days after surgery, you are NOT going to want to go out for food/sundries. Having a &#39;travel-buddy&#39; is something I&#39;m planning on.
<br>
I ran across this blog entry for a SRS traveler. Even though your going for &#39;just&#39; FFS, still pertains IMO. It&#39;s kinda eye opening.

It&#39;s not like you&#39;re totally incapacitated. Depending on what you&#39;re having done you may be quite swollen though and may not feel comfortable going out though.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re by yourself, then you need to have at least 5 days of food / drink / entertainment sorted out before you go to surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you have Jaw or mouth surgery, get food that can be eaten without a whole lot of chewing and that you won&#39;t have to open your mouth too wide to eat.
</p>
<p>
I had my mother with me in Spain. She was mostly good for procuring food because I was pretty fucking swollen in the first few days.

I&#39;m in a very similar spot, except I have no partner. I asked about this a few days back in another post. giving that link here. I think stocking up, and nurses by the hour, for the first few days (few hours each) is the way to go.

I can only speak to my experience, and I simply cannot imagine having to deal with recovery alone, and I just went to Boston. I didn&#39;t even leave the States.
</p>
<p>
When we got to Boston and checked into the hotel, it seemed kinda… skeezy. There were some quirks with the room, it was cramped, super noisy, and just... didn&#39;t feel good. Switched to another hotel which, while a bit more expensive, was the best decision we made that whole trip (though it wasn&#39;t like we faced a ton of tough ones or anything).
</p>
<p>
I stayed in the hospital overnight, so that first night wasn&#39;t bad. Even just leaving the hospital and going back to the hotel was quite a chore though. I mean, painkillers are great but, I was surprisingly unsteady on my feet and got wore out in a hurry.
</p>
<p>
My wife was absolutely amazing throughout. She took such good care of me.... I&#39;ll spend the rest of my life paying her back for that, happily.
</p>
<p>
She made sure we had plenty of food, snacks, etc. She made sure to keep on top of my meds so that I wouldn&#39;t get behind on painkillers (which would have happened otherwise, because I can&#39;t sleep on painkillers so when they start wearing off I fall asleep then wake up later in agony and have to wait for them to kick in). She kept me on track for changing bandages, redressing the incisions, keeping clean, keeping ice applied appropriately, getting prescriptions filled, going for walks (even just down the hallway was exhausting for a bit), keeping appointments, phone calls, text messages, emails...
</p>
<p>
I mean absolutely everything. She was positively smashing!
</p>
<p>
A few nights after surgery while we were in the hotel, I started feeling super hot and dizzy, like I was going to pass out, and it was kinda hard to breathe. She kept me calm and called the after hours care line. It didn&#39;t seem to be an emergency, but they wanted to see me first thing in the morning to check some things. Got a camera shoved into my nose and down my throat... that was fun (no, it wasn&#39;t, it hurt like hell).
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t remember what the verdict was other than I just got overheated and was super swollen, but it was scary as hell.
</p>
<p>
Guaranteed if I&#39;d been alone I would have freaked and called 911. I certainly wouldn&#39;t have taken care of myself as well as my wife did.
</p>
<p>
As it was, I watched a shitload of Netflix. Star Trek Enterprise mostly actually. Wife can just about recite it. I was able to focus on just healing, how I felt, and how much better I felt. Even through all the bruising, the swelling, the blood... all of it... I could see
<em>
ME.
</em>
A lot of people have a sort of &#34;WTF have I done?!&#34; moment following a major surgery like that, but I never did. From the first moment I looked in a mirror without my bandages, I filled with joy.
</p>
<p>
When people have asked me about recovery my response has typically been that it wasn&#39;t bad. My wife scoffs, and rightly so I think. My recovery was actually quite easy. But the reason for that, is because she was there taking care of me,
<em>
making
</em>
it easy.
</p>
<p>
IMHO, if it is at all a possibility for you to have someone with you, you should.

I don’t have much advice except, that I’m from Argentina and I’ve been to Buenos Aires once with my uncle and they do have a lot of beautiful stuff to see (like the Pink House, Teatro Colon, Plaza de Mayo, etc...) and it’s very history/architecture/art related and the food is amazing. So like there would be a lot of stuff your kid might enjoy but like depending if they’re/you’re into that.

Yeah, wow, this is timely...  I&#39;m likely going to Argentina as well, and I&#39;m currently trying to work out what to do about my 14 year old son...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll almost certainly be taking someone with me though, I&#39;m terrified of post surgical depression or something when I&#39;m stuck alone in a foreign country

I know a number of women who have been to Facial Team alone, but they have really good post-op care, if you pay for it.

My wife spent 2 days in hospital, and then she discharged to the hotel. She could  Not have done it by herself for those first five days. It was rough and it’s nit like she was completely incapacitated, but having me there to get her food and keep her on track with medication times was pretty important.

I went to Rossi, and while I _could_ have done it alone, having my wife with me made things soooo much better.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll echo the other posters&#39; sentiments about needing to stock up on food beforehand, but the other part I found is that post-FFS I was so easily fatigued that self-care was exhausting, leaving pretty much no energy to do basic living tasks like preparing food.
