Hey all, few more weeks have passed and I figured things changed enough for another post.
</p>
<p>
This is a good panorama of the different positions / views of my junk that I have.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m feel really disappointed and regret having surgery at this point. To my mind my glans looks eerily similar to the tip of a penis, with urethra down the center. Additionally, I don&#39;t think have much minora and it&#39;s so much of a mess I&#39;m not really sure what I have and where they end.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I rolled the dice and got shitty results. If you don&#39;t have significant donor material or aren&#39;t intact I would be cautious of getting bottom surgery if vulva aesthetics are important to you.
</p>

I find an interesting make you say that only because I looked at the photos first and thought wow that looks great. Then I read your comment. I donâ€™t like people that bullshit for the sake of bullshitting but I do think it looks good but Iâ€™m no expert

I thought it looked good too! But again I totally understand having a vision of what you wanted or expected and being upset not getting that. But there are revisions and things to improve still right?

Thanks for the kind words. It&#39;s pretty hard to determine what&#39;s real vs my own feelings. Lots of people say &#39;it&#39;s fine, really&#39; but I can only see something mangled.
</p>
<p>
I think my dissatisfaction comes from not having enough material to look like the prototypical &#39;Jun result&#39;. I think her normal results look really nice- I just didn&#39;t have enough, frankly.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon was pretty dismissive on the idea of revisions. And frankly, there isn&#39;t more material left to work with. So I&#39;d either have to try to have Jun reposition what I have (not much) or start adding grafts into the region. I don&#39;t really have a strife sense of the options here.

Sure, different people have different aesthetic ideals or standards.
</p>
<p>
I think when you compare my result to other Jun results it&#39;s pretty clear that my lack of tissue caused me to have a really bad outcome in comparison.
</p>
<p>
Then again, vulva aesthetics was my most important aspect.

just to clarify, youâ€™re saying you had a lack of tissue to work with already going into the surgery, right?

Yea, I didn&#39;t have much tissue. Slightly smaller than average, but a very high and tight circumcision.

<p>
Jun himself said that they &#39;erred on the side of taking too much rather than too little when [mutilating] you&#39;

your result is wonderful.  Cis women have surgery to have smaller labia minora.  don&#39;t bother yourself with aesthetics, make them cis, they&#39;re not pretty at all.

Yea, if my junk looked natal I wouldn&#39;t care. Natal is fine in my book- but mine lacks a lot of complexity and detail that natal vulvas have.

Sister, your are still healing, and I felt the same at your stage. I went to Dr Jun myself. Those small imperfections you hone in on shows how female you are, but have YOUR own very beautiful vagina now. I donâ€™t like saying natal or cis because you are a woman. Your vagina will still settle and Iâ€™m jealous of your clitoral hood. But I still think Dr Jun gave me the best vagina possible under each surgeon Iâ€™ve seen.(my opinion he is the best) my inner labia are not even, but he uses the tissue available and he works harder than any doctor Iâ€™ve seen. Yes he is strict and handsomely Asian and married lol but he does have to be strict with us because he really knows what heâ€™s talking about. I hated him for a month because of post op depression, and then I fell in love with my vagina and my beautiful orgasms, and sex is so perfect. Remember he works from the inside out with a robot. A very new technique for us, I think you will start to see beauty down there soon. Just like we all do.

That&#39;s true, but the things I dislike will only worsen as the swelling continues to go down. If I don&#39;t have enough labia now, imagine after the swelling subsides.

Donâ€™t judge this early in the recovery. Still TONS of swelling. One year out is when certain areas will become less inflammed. Due to gravity, constant dialation, etc. I really like the hood he gave you. Itâ€™ll lessen in swelling.

Thatâ€™s typical. If you want it closed at the fourchett, you need to go back for a revision.

Yea, encompassing the introitus / meeting at the fourchette is only really available with revision. Although if you look at other Jun results, you&#39;ll see that he often gets the minora lengthwise down to the introitus and occasionally to the fourchette. He&#39;ll go as far as you have tissue.

At the moment you can&#39;t have any real idea of how you will look when everything shrinks back to normal. Maybe in 6 months you will be happier. The CIS vagina is infinite in the way it looks and constructed ones are the same. Keep up the salt water baths, dilation and give it plenty of pampering. Don&#39;t abuse it! Sorry for calling it, it.

sorry you&#39;re disappointed. that&#39;s of course valid too. I&#39;ll just say that if I could be guaranteed this result i&#39;d be doing bottom surgery for sure.

Yea, I mean if you like this you should check out other Jun results on the sun.

Everyone keeps telling me it&#39;s fine, but tbh I don&#39;t think people normally comment negatively here. I wonder if there would be a way to mark a post as accepting negative criticism.
