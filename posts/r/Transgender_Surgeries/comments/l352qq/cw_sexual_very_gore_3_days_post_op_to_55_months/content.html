[CW: sexual, very gore] 3 days post op to 5.5 months post op. I&#39;m fine with the top, but the bottom looks really rough, ugly, and much different than the rest of it. Does it look off to anyone else? Note: most of the shots where the bottom portion look gaping are with my legs up. Dr Ramineni, DC

I expect by top and bottom youâ€™re referring to the anterior and posterior commissures. These are known revisions, at least with some surgeons. Both would make a noticeable improvement.

I think that the difference you are seeing is that your fourchette (the part where the left and right labia minora connect) is placed right underneath your urethra opening instead of right underneath your vaginal opening, which results in your vaginal canal seeming like its seperate entity from the rest of your vulva. Afaik this is something that is quite common due to the problems during recovery when it comes to dilating because the intense dilation routine during the first couple of weeks/months would create risks tearing this area apart. But it should be fixable later on.

Thanks for the info! That makes sense. Do you think its the type of thing where I should to see a different  surgeon for the revision, or see the same one because they&#39;re familiar  with it

I personally did not have srs myself yet so I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s right for me to just answer your question so take my opinion with a couple of grains of salt: I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong about consulting with the surgeon you first chose, explaining them what is exactly bothering you and then asking them how they&#39;d fix it. But I also think that it would be a good idea to consult with another surgeon who got a good reputation in our community to see what they have to say and see what their approach would be.

Itâ€™s off... could probably be fixed with a revision.

For future reference.

I think your overall result is nice but you see this with so many surgeons. The entrances never really look that cis. But you do have material for a revision! But congrats either way and it really is a beautiful result for the most part. If I weren&#39;t already scheduled for a consult with bella soon, I would consider this guy.

Photo 7 shows this isn&#39;t natal, but the ones where you can really only see the mons look good. I&#39;m guessing scars will fade with time.

Hey there! Things are healing really well! The concern about the vaginal opening being below and almost outside of the labia is something Iâ€™ve heard a few times with Dr R. Since I have surgery with him in June I reached out and asked the surgical assistant about the concern and she said that it is purposeful because then there is a smaller chance for tearing to occur during early dilation. She said they do a revision surgery to fix that issue once things have healed enough to be able to handle it.

Thatâ€™s great to hear. And also thank you for sharing. Itâ€™s because of people like you I feel more comfortable going into this. The early pictures especially help because it helps me curb my early expectations and be ready that things wonâ€™t be pretty.
