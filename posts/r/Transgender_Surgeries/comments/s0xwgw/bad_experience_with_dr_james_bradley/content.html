I had an appointment today with dr james Bradley,  you would think when you have an appointment you get to be seen by the dr at the te of the appointment, well this dr and his staff dont think so because they made me wait for about an hour, now i have other stuff to do so i asked the lady next to me how long she was waiting and she told me about 2 hours, so i got up canceled and got a refund on my copay.
</p>
<p>
To top it all off his staff refused to use my name on anything,  they kept referring to me in my dead name despite them having my preferred name on file, and despite me telling them that i dont appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
What a waste of time, i dont think i can trust a dr who cant even keep the time.
</p>
<p>
Dr bradly fix ur shit!

Sometimes doctors have emergencies that can’t wait. It’s unfortunate, but if a patient’s surgery runs long or if somebody post-op is having complications and needs to be seen at once, that takes priority over everything else including consultations. It’s not always the case, but it’s a possibility. What is more concerning here is the office getting your name wrong. That’s a bigger red flag to me than the time issue by itself.
