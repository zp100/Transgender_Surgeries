Hi again everyone! So I am here at 6 weeks (well minus a day). Through the magic of healing the separation is starting to close and swelling is slowly going down. I am still pretty numb, though I can start to feel touch in a few places. I got a little brave the other day and parted my bits and I think I can see where my urethra is but my clit may be further up than I am willing to push. Dilating continues to get easier, I took a break from trying to size up for a week but resumed this week and managed to get it purple (p2-&gt;#1) all the way in with some effort. Discharge is pretty steady not a ton but not so little that I can get away with no pad.

Everyone is different with this, the first week after unpacking I had to change my pad 2-3 times a day then that became 1 during the day and 1 over night and thats pretty much where I am at now except im just using panty liners instead of pads. Also good luck on your surgery hun! You will do great!

What is the feeling like inside? Like obviously the internal tissue doesnt have feeling, but what exactly is it you feel when inserting? What areas feel and such. Having my surgery with wittenberg in a little over a week. (:

Congrats sister, you are in good hands.
</p>
<p>
How does it feel is a complex question.
</p>
<p>
Initially cold when the lube makes contact with the labia minora, then a bit tender/tight feeling as the tip pushes past the hole in the pelvic floor muscles. After that you can feel pressure as it squeezes between the rectum/bladder/prostate, its not unpleasant just a lot of pressure. Then at the back you feel pressure from the poking the end of the canal, this can be tender too initially. Pulling put feels like nothing most of the way until the tip passes the pelvic floor again depending on how the dilator is angled it can feel like nothing or a little tender. The bigger dilator i use kinda makes me feel like I have to pee while its in lol. Hope thats enlightening!

I can&#39;t even begin to imagine other than probably sore later lol, dilating is mostly just one in and out and maybe a few adjustments. Dilators are not comfortable lol.

So there are no nerves on the inside tissue for you to feel anything with SRS? I didn&#39;t realize this

For PPT style vaginoplasty they use peritoneal lining from inside your body instead of penile/scrotal tissue, it doesn&#39;t have touch sense but you still feel pressure, this is similar to a cis womans experience as asside from a few spots the vaginal canal is not sensate. That said as part of the process of making the canal the cavity is wedged between the prostate and he rectum so anything being shoved up there also stimulates the prostate in a way very reminiscent of a gspot.

Right .. interesting. So they can use the scrotal tissue for more aesthetic purposes then? PPT is the srs I have been looking into getting. Possibly the doctor in Oregon, I forget her name but she does it.

Something to keep in mind is that majority of ppt surgeons only do &#34;hybrid&#34; ppt, meaning  they just use ppt as as lining for the back of the canal instead of scrotal tissue. As far as I am aware only mozaic (Bonnington/Wittenberg) do the entire canal with the internal tissue.

Omg every doctor does it SRS different... This seriously makes things hard to decide.. I wonder which one would be better? I mean.. I think I know your opinion. But do you know the differences? I don&#39;t really think I can Google this lol..

Functionally speaking they are pretty much identical, my main reason for choosing mozaic over min jun (who i also consulted with) was wanting to have as much material as possible for building the labia in one shot if possible. I also felt their aesthetic would look more natural with my chunkier body type. The best thing you can do is do as many consultations as possible and ask how they go about their techniques.

I was hoping to have better outside aesthetic. I was commutated as a baby. So I don&#39;t have all the material to work with that someone without genital mutilation would have. I had hoped that ppt would allow me to have a more cis look as much as possible.

Well there is no one size fits all best of all worlds surgeon. All of them have their pros and cons and specialties and shopping around for the right fit is entirely appropriate and even recommended.

Hello, it is a very good result, when you are completely healed it will look perfect, one question: Are you going to continue with the updates? It would be very helpful for future patients of Dr. Bonnington.

What were you told to expect in terms of discharge long term?  What have some other gals with PPT said? Long term is this a lot of fluid or can you expect to get to most cis vaginal levels (when they’re not having “the time”)?

Here is what I was told: they dont know. Ppt is an experimental surgery thats only been performed on trans girls for about 3ish years now. The long term data simply doesn&#39;t exist and from they have seen the level of discharge varies significantly from person to person. Some people (at the far extremes) have so much discharge it becomes a nuisance and on the other end some have basically none at all similar to a standard penile inversion lining. I personally seem to have about average for a cis woman discharge wise. I wish there was a better answer but this is one of those things were the experimental nature of the procedure really shows itself versus going with PI which we understand extremely well at this point.

Thanks for your reply.
</p>
<p>
Does the peritoneal discharge smell?  What’s it look like?
</p>
<p>
Did they give you a sense of how much is enough to be a nuisance?  Is that a thick pad every day or just feels too swampy if you don’t do a good job wiping in the bathroom?
</p>
<p>
(I’m thinking about this a lot for me maybe in the next year or two and I really want to get an idea of what to expect.)

Enough to be a nuisance is a personal tolerance thing, multiple pads every day but again extremely rare. Peritoneal discharge by itself is really just water, however its smell/taste is affected by how well you manage your internal cleanliness and flora just like cis women though the discharge from the ppt graft is more base than the acidic secretions of a natal vagina. The discharge can be a cloudy white-ish/clear/slightly yellow though this is depending on where you are in healing, mine is slightly yellowish but its not super apparent except for on pads.
</p>
<p>
:) If you are already thinking about it Id suggest you get on with doing consults/hair removal now as it takes around a years worth of removal regardless of ppt vs pi and most surgeons have a year long waitlist as is.

I stated doing laser years ago and have had some electro down south too. I was planning to keep it going hair removal down there regardless of gcs or not. But that’s a good point about the waitlist for consults/surgery.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to be 12 months on hormones until April.  But I guess maybe I should schedule things now since even regular PCPs book you out a long time.

I wanted to get my HRT “in the system” (originally got it off plume) and it took 5 months to get an endocrinology appointment - where the endo just basically rubber stamped what I was doing.

You’re right. I should call to book the gcs consult soon especially because I’m looking for PPV and there is like one surgeon doing that in the US (that I could find).

I personally wouldn’t be happy if it were me but by that same token this seems like it’s within cis vagina territory

Thanks I guess? I asked for Normal I got normal, this is also typical of my surgeons style aesthetically. Please feel free to use someone else if this isn&#39;t what you are after.

I think maybe I misunderstood. I thought you were asking for our thoughts because of the title. Was that not the case?

You were mistaken, I replied with my thoughts which is what I meant. Frankly while I appreciate positive comments I don&#39;t actually care what other people think, I am the person who has to live with it and my choices. This is purely for the benefit of whoever is considering my surgeon since there are few examples of his work and the healing process for full ppt vaginas.
