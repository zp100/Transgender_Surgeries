My clit is mostly healed!  Those who read
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/sn4c1r/part_8_had_pptppvpptv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg/">part 8
</a>
know it was injured 12-25-21 and stuck sideways for almost 3 months, causing me enormous sadness.  But as of 3-18-22, it&#39;s been mostly out, thanks to my holding it in place as described in part 8.  Here&#39;s a summary timeline of injury and healing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
12-25-21: Injury caused swelling on both sides of clit.
</li>
<li>
12-28-21: Clit tilted right today but was straight yesterday.
</li>
<li>
12-29-21: Clit straight again but red spot visible on right.
</li>
<li>
12-30-21: Clit tilted right and never returned to straight.
</li>
<li>
1-3-22: Started manually tilting clit left 1-2 mins a day and gently massaging the swollen wall right of clit.  This always caused some pain.
</li>
<li>
1-4-22: At Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s suggestion, applied ice and took ibuprofen regularly.
</li>
<li>
1-12-22: First time I was able to manually pull clit full forward without pain.
</li>
<li>
1-13-22: Held clit forward for 17 mins.  I likely continued holding it straight once every day or two till 1-16 but my notes aren&#39;t clear.
</li>
<li>
1-17-22: My old PT said not to touch clit so I stopped even though I&#39;d been seeing slow improvement.
</li>
<li>
1-19-22: Gyn said touching it was delaying healing.
</li>
<li>
2-1-22: Plastic surgeons also said not to touch it, yet agreed some manipulation was necessary during healing.
</li>
<li>
2-2-22: First visit with new physical therapist.  She said instead of directly rubbing clit wall I should indirectly rub it by rubbing labia above it for a couple minutes every other day but wasn&#39;t sure if I should pull it left.  Instead, I used a plastic &#34;splint&#34; I&#39;d sculpted to hold the area above the clit apart.
</li>
<li>
2-4-22: Began sleeping on my back to prevent crushing clit between legs.
</li>
<li>
2-6-22: Splint wasn&#39;t obviously helping so tried manually straightening clit and got right edge to pop up so I could feel it.  I held it straight for a few mins most days after this.
</li>
<li>
2-11-22: PT and I agreed splint was likely bruising more than helping and said I was being too rough in how I held clit straight.  She said hold it straight 60-90 secs per day and indirectly rub right wall for 2 mins.
</li>
<li>
2-16-22: PT agreed I could increase clit hold to 3-5 mins.
</li>
<li>
2-19-22: PT was concerned I was always on my back so I slept on my side for ~2.5 hours tonight and ~6 hours a couple nights later, but it seemed to cause pain above clit and possibly a swollen urethra that slowed urine stream.  I returned to sleeping on back as long as I could stand but slept on my side with three pillows between my knees the remainder of the night.
</li>
<li>
2-24-22: Using a webcam held in a phone arm, was able to observe clit as I gently pulled it out of its sideways position.  It was really stuck and took a few mins to get the right side visible.
</li>
<li>
2-25-22: Pulled clit out and held it straight for 30 mins and it got slowly easier to pull out as I repeated this 10-30 mins each day.
</li>
<li>
3-6-22: Began holding clit straight for 30 mins just before sleeping on my back in the hope it might stay straight as long as I didn&#39;t move.  As days went on, I gradually reduced the pressure of my right finger that pulled the wall to the right of the clit.  I theorized this would let the right side of the clit get pushed/stretched upward from the pressure of the flesh beneath it.  When I got up at night, sometimes there was a pressure as if the clit had stayed straight while I slept and a sense of it slipping sideways as I got up, but I was afraid to feel with my finger because I needed the hope it was staying straight.
</li>
<li>
3-11-22: Experimented with pulling clit gently to the left each time I lay down on my back throughout the day.  I didn&#39;t try to get the right side fully out for fear that it popping in and out so often would create too much inflammation.
</li>
<li>
3-12-22: Since there was no obvious inflammation or pain from yesterday I decided to pull clit out all the way out each time I lay down today, which was about 10 times total.
</li>
<li>
3-13-22: I started checking by feel if clit was still straight after completely settling to sleep.  I found it had slipped to the side after my 30-min hold on camera despite being very careful in my movements putting away the camera, so apparently it hadn&#39;t always been staying straight for the first part of the night.  I straightened it by feel and didn&#39;t shift before sleeping.
</li>
<li>
3-15-22: At this point I barely need to put any pressure on right clit wall while I press down on left of clit to keep it popped out.  I noticed right wall seemed slightly swollen after holding it for 15 mins so let it go early.  It remained straight even after I put the camera stuff away.
</li>
<li>
3-17-22: I managed to sleep on my back all night and never got up to pee and clit was still straight in the morning!  It even survived a bow-legged walk to the bathroom but did slip sideways later in the day.
</li>
<li>
3-18-22: Last night I only lay on my back for a couple hours before I had so much back pain I had to move to my side with three pillows between my knees.  This morning I didn&#39;t even check my clit because I felt no pressure from it and I figured sleeping on my side had definitely pushed it sideways.  But after using the bathroom and walking around the house with legs together, I went to pull it straight when I lay down again and it was already straight!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These photos show how bad it looked when I started pulling it out again.  Notice the little red spots on right edge of clit and purplish discoloration on the right half of clit:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/cv8ackv289q81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1ad0b6ecf8d5edc6f3c7fb9c56079a4a8fa932b">https://preview.redd.it/cv8ackv289q81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1ad0b6ecf8d5edc6f3c7fb9c56079a4a8fa932b
</a>
</p>
<p>
3-5 shows a dark red spot towards the top of the photo that I originally thought was blood but after dabbing it repeatedly I realized it was just skin.  It disappeared the next day and was never seen again.
</p>
<p>
On 3-8 there was a larger, less dark red spot on right edge of clit but it mostly disappeared by the next day.  As days went by, redness of the wall to the right of clit didn&#39;t change much until 3-18 when the clit stayed out:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/xb66pwsou8q81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d03276f8491b33b867cef8e7868c9d9635d235e">https://preview.redd.it/xb66pwsou8q81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d03276f8491b33b867cef8e7868c9d9635d235e
</a>
</p>
<p>
Even looking under the right side of the clit on 3-18 doesn&#39;t show much redness.  This quick change is remarkable and I think it proves my theory that the redness was irritation caused by the right side of the clit pulling the skin above it downwards in a way it wasn&#39;t meant to be pulled.
</p>
<p>
3-22-22: Clit had been straight every time I checked it up till today when I was forced to sit for hours and do physical activity.  This had things swollen enough that the right of clit got stuck down a little, but not as much as it used to:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/acqf1111w8q81.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4e0ee56a5745335a66522a005b51bb7d89431ef">https://preview.redd.it/acqf1111w8q81.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4e0ee56a5745335a66522a005b51bb7d89431ef
</a>
</p>
<p>
I was able to pull it out again with almost zero resistance and it stayed out easily.  The incident still scared me pretty badly and I held it out for 15+ mins before sleeping.  Over the next few days I caught it getting stuck right like this again now and then but it&#39;s been improving as I&#39;ve avoided stressing it for the most part.  I still catch it tilting right slightly without actually getting its right side stuck down out of view beneath the clit wall, and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s always a little more right tilted in my new photos than in photos before the injury.  This worries me but I hope it will gradually improve in time.
</p>
<p>
I still check it frequently by feel and sometimes hold it left for ~5 mins once or twice a day.  I&#39;ve been able to sleep with two pillows between knees the last few nights without making it tilt.  I started with pillows pushed up close to the vag to try to keep the thighs pushed apart farther and each night I move the pillows a little closer to my knees to let the clit get used to my thighs getting gradually closer together.  Soon, I&#39;ll try only one pillow between knees.
</p>
<p>
So, healing my clit has been a nearly 3-month ordeal but I was really happy for many days after 3-18 once I accepted it wasn&#39;t going to suddenly slip right again.  I&#39;m still kind of mad that I was on the right track on 1-13 for pulling it out until all those doctors said not to touch it.  I probably would have had it healed by the end of Feb and avoided so many days of hopelessness and depression if I&#39;d continued to pull it left, but then again I didn&#39;t have the video camera setup idea at that point so I might have used too much pressure and injured it further.
</p>
<p>
One thing I&#39;ve definitely noticed is that when the clit was stuck sideways, I often had a straight-down urine stream and since it&#39;s been out, pee usually heads to the left or right.  So that&#39;s unfortunate but of course I&#39;d rather have the clit where it&#39;s supposed to be.  It does feel different when it&#39;s been out for awhile - more rounded and sensitive.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
In other news, my labia pain continues to diminish very slowly.  The PT can always find little lumps towards the bottom of labia that she massages on to gradually break them up, and they seem to cause most of my pain.  I&#39;m supposed to massage them gently every two days but I have a really hard time finding them for some reason.  The area also tends to hurt less when I touch it vs when someone else touches it.  I don&#39;t understand why but it basically means I&#39;m still flinching when my SO touches me and that&#39;s really frustrating.  I can, at least, say that I flinch less than three months ago.
</p>
<p>
PT has me on a regimen of sitting in a recliner chair an hour a day and in a straight-back chair during meals to build up my tolerance for sitting.  I usually use my Twin Cheeks cushion to try to avoid some labia swelling that might push my clit sideways, but I can sit without it without too much discomfort.
</p>
<p>
When I saw plastic surgeons on 3-1, they did a silver nitrate treatment for granulation at the deepest part of the vaginal canal.  By 3-6 I was barely using the orange dilator again but on 3-7 I saw a new gyn that&#39;s closer to where I live and she did another silver nitrate treatment on the same granulation.  It was probably a bad idea to do two treatments so close together because after that, it always hurt significantly to get the smallest purple dilator in.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t try the orange dilator again till 3-17 and I&#39;ve been very gentle with it, always stopping when there is any pain or resistance.  PT says to wait a minute and then press a little deeper if there&#39;s no pain.  As of 3-28 I still haven&#39;t gotten orange to full depth again, but I do feel like overall pain from dilation is significantly less than a month ago and I can keep purple at full depth with much less pressure than it used to require.
</p>
<p>
For the last three weeks my PT has had me push the small dilator in a couple inches and then pull gently down and a bit to the left for 60 seconds and then down and a bit to the right for 60 seconds to stretch the opening and I think it&#39;s helped a little.
</p>
<p>
A comment on my previous journal suggested coconut oil might help the canal heal.  I found
<a href="https://coconutoils.com/coconut-oil-as-a-vaginal-lubricant/">this
</a>
which says &#34;coconut oil is high in alkaline pH, whereas the vagina’s pH is normally acidic. If you apply the coconut oil too much to that area, it can disrupt the balance of your vagina’s pH and can potentially lead to more infections. Please avoid using Coconut oil as lube, especially if you’re prone to yeast infections&#34;.  So with penile inversion where vaginal pH is likely not acidic, coconut oil probably doesn&#39;t reduce pH, but with peritoneal pull-through, I worry coconut oil will reduce acidity and promote bacterial growth.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, on 3-16 I tried a bit of coconut oil on the tip of the dilator with ID glide as the main lubricant.  This resulted in needing a lot more soap to clean myself and the dilators, so I used less coconut oil the next day and then cleanup wasn&#39;t too bad.  By using coconut oil some nights and not others, I noticed I was getting blobs of green slime pretty consistently the days after using coconut oil and never when I didn&#39;t use it, so I think it is indeed promoting bacteria growth.  A few days of using coconut oil seemed to increase bad odors as well.  At the same time, oil wasn&#39;t having any obvious effect on pain levels, so I decided to stop using it.
</p>
<p>
Note that I was using an old jar of Trader Joe&#39;s pure coconut oil meant for cooking and my PT mentioned I might have better luck with a product crafted specifically as a vaginal lubricant.  She suggested Desert Harvest Aloe Glide but I haven&#39;t had a chance to try it yet.

I haven&#39;t posted abdomen scar pics since 9-7-21 in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/oxeaee/part_5_had_pptppv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg_march/">Part 5
</a>
so here&#39;s an updated set:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/0ujco05n1cx81.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49a23918455d5c1f469f8198cf4afbe323cde156">https://preview.redd.it/0ujco05n1cx81.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49a23918455d5c1f469f8198cf4afbe323cde156
</a>
</p>
<p>
They&#39;re faint enough now that my physical therapist was having trouble finding them, though I think that&#39;s only because they blend in among the stretch marks.  They are easier to see because of the flash in these photos and can appear darker or lighter depending how ambient light hits them.  I haven&#39;t done anything special to treat them since around the time of my last photo when I was using silicone tape over them.  PT checked them a few weeks ago and couldn&#39;t feel any scar tissue beneath them so says they don&#39;t need to be manipulated anymore.
</p>
<p>
Starting 4-1, I&#39;ve been using the smallest purple dilator at full depth for ~12 mins followed by orange dilator for 30 mins as deep as I can get it.  When I feel pain I back off slightly and hold it in place for 30-60 seconds before going deeper and generally advance the dilator with little to no pain, but it takes longer and I don&#39;t always reach full depth with orange.  Most days purple stays at full depth without nearly as much force as I used to apply but I often find once orange hits full depth, the next day things are swollen and I can&#39;t get it full depth again for 1-3 more days.  Lack of progress is very frustrating but with this tactic, blood discharge on panty liners is minimal to non-existent depending on the day.
</p>
<p>
With massages from physical therapist and my slow dilations, pain near entrance has reduced significantly but there is a pain/tight point a couple inches in that hasn&#39;t changed much in the last 2+ weeks.  There&#39;s also slight pain from having orange at full depth and that also seems most likely to cause blood discharge on pads, though I never see blood on the dilator.  I very likely still have a bit of granulation at the deepest point despite ~4 silver nitrate treatments.
</p>
<p>
Labia pain reduction has been more noticeable.  PT has to push deeper to find nodules of scar tissue and I feel the same thing when I massage twice a week between weekly PT visits.  I can barely tell by feel where the labia scars are anymore.  I generally massage right before bed and feel some 1-2 level pain with my legs together and a pillow between my knees.  I notice more soreness the next day but the following day soreness is usually minimal.  I&#39;ve been sitting on a normal chair for 40-60 mins a day and a recliner for 1-2 hours and that rarely causes much pain anymore.
</p>
<p>
Many months ago I mentioned having dryness/soreness without panties but that&#39;s mostly resolved now.  I think it was mostly caused by the labia skin being so thin and sensitive.  I also got in the habit of sleeping without panties to try to get it used to air exposure and that may have helped.  Other than occasional granulation discharge and green/yellow bacterial discharge if I don&#39;t douche twice a week, I can go days with nothing visible on liners so overproduction of transudate is definitely not a problem.
</p>
<p>
My panties used to always stick to my crotch and I think that was from discharge from granulation tissue.  Since that&#39;s been mostly resolved, I haven&#39;t found a hair stuck deep between my labia in months.  Once I accidentally caught a hair on the dilator and it stayed stuck to the dilator instead of pulling off inside me.
</p>
<p>
My clit has been slowly improving and I&#39;ve noticed when I pull it left before sleeping on my side with one pillow between my knees, sometimes even with  it tends to stay very straight every time I check it as if the pressure is keeping it out.  This makes sense in that the pressure would only push it sideways if it were already significantly sideways before the pressure was applied.  There was one day a couple weeks ago it did get pushed sideways after a lot of driving and sitting but in general it seems to be staying straighter more often than a month ago and is rarely full sideways, just slightly sideways.  I no longer feel any swelling or pain from having my legs fully together.  I&#39;m peeing more straight but usually it still goes to the side at some point.
</p>
<p>
I tried using the Desert Harvest aloe lube my PT recommended for two days.  It&#39;s very thick and doesn&#39;t drip off the dilator but both nights after I used it I felt a faint version of the sort of pain you get with a bladder infection and I rarely get that sensation.  I also felt like it might have been causing slight irritation to the vaginal canal as purple was significantly harder to keep at full depth than on previous nights and orange only went in half way.  I switched back to ID glide and had similar tightness the next night but not the bladder infection irritation, and the night after I got orange to full depth.  None of this really proves the aloe lube was at fault but it also didn&#39;t have any obvious benefits and it&#39;s expensive so I can&#39;t recommend it.  I may try it again later to see if I get the same results but right now I just want to heal.  I&#39;m now using it for anal dilation since it makes less of a mess but I do feel it might be causing slight irritation there as well, though it could be my imagination.
</p>
<p>
4-3: Another session of laser hair removal.  It didn&#39;t cause much redness or scabbing this time and there wasn&#39;t much pain driving myself home with the Twin Cheeks pillow.
</p>
<p>
4-4: Another gyn visit and another silver nitrate treatment.  She says the granulation is on a little flap of skin at the deepest part of the canal and it would be more likely to heal if it were cut off and then silver nitrated, but my canal can&#39;t be stretched wide enough for the tool that would cut it off.  As usual, after nitrate I struggled to get back to full depth dilations with orange over the next month.
</p>
<p>
4-7: Tried masturbating.  It felt good and not much different than it used to feel except that towards the start, the clit pushed towards my finger much higher on the left and the ridge of skin to the left of the clit was more engorged and protruded out farther than I remember it doing before the injury. I found the same ridge on the right but much deeper down, so it felt like the whole area had tilted right and it sort of scared me.  But I pushed the left side down and after 10+ mins the left side seemed submerged more and the right side had risen almost as high as the left. I don&#39;t know what could have caused that correction unless I was maybe forcing blood from left to right through areas that had gotten scarred or clogged or something?  Sometimes it feels like a lump below the clit can be shifted from left to right to make it sit straighter and I think that&#39;s probably part of the former body of the penis.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the case, I was rubbing on and off for ~30 mins and then trying to orgasm for ~15 mins when my phone alarm went off and ruined the mood.  I didn&#39;t feel it was worth the risk of starting over and never ended up trying again but I do think things are mostly ok and I didn&#39;t suffer any obvious damage from my attempt.  My libido is just low in general and I rarely feel I have time/energy to masturbate even when I&#39;m aroused.
</p>
<p>
4-18: This was the day my clit got stuck right ~66 degrees after visiting family for Easter (lots of sitting and driving).  The next day it tended to go sideways on its own a lot more easily than usual and I kept having to pull it straight.  It was mostly staying straight on the third day.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Unrelated to my vaginoplasty, I&#39;ve made good progress with my singing voice in the last month.  I&#39;ve been practicing female voice for around four years now and did lots of research and speech therapy sessions but something finally clicked to let me more easily hit high notes and have better control.  The key for me at this stage is to focus on pushing the sound of my voice forward till sound seems to come from just behind my teeth. When done properly I can feel my gums vibrate on some notes. I&#39;ve also recognized a particular muscle that helps put the sound in the area. For me it feels like widening and slightly lifting an area above the back of my tongue. Flexing that muscle can make my upper lip near the corners of my mouth also want to lift.
</p>
<p>
I hate recording and listening to my voice but I force myself to sometimes and I found that what sounds better in my head doesn&#39;t sound as good on the recording.  When I make sound come from farther back in my throat and I strain to &#34;pinch&#34; it into a tone that sounds good in my head, it limits my control, usually makes high notes crack, and doesn&#39;t sound as good when played back.  I found a free android app called Echo by Project Neon that records while a button is pressed and plays it back as soon as you release the button and it helped me to test different tactics quickly.
</p>

Anyway, my singing voice is still better some days than others but the point is that you can still make progress even after this much time, so keep working at it.  I still struggle with my speaking voice because my habit is still to slip into that pinched tone when I&#39;m not really focusing on my voice instead of on what I&#39;m trying to say, but I think I&#39;m improving very slowly.  I should have recorded myself much earlier and not gotten into bad habits.

One other random transfemale tip that took me forever to discover is that it looks nice to shave your eyebrows with a 1/4&#34; shaver attachment.  Run the blade towards the hairs so it catches them and doesn&#39;t slide over them without trimming them.  You can even run your fingers over the hairs to make them stand up straighter ahead of the blade.  Then darken brows with a brow liner.  It makes a big difference to looking feminine even if you do no other makeup.

<p>
It&#39;s taken forever but I&#39;m finally starting to feel somewhat close to almost healed.  I try to appreciate that I can consistently clean myself in the shower with no pain.  Unfortunately, whenever doctors or my SO touches my labia there&#39;s almost always a little pain (why is self touch so different from other&#39;s touch?) but it&#39;s much less than it used to be, 1/10 or less, and it usually fades away if the touch is prolonged more than 10-20 secs.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve reduced physical therapy sessions to once every two weeks and am instead massaging labia every other day.  A month or two ago this always hurt at 1-2/10 in many places but now it&#39;s under 1/10 and mostly in the two places that are most compressed with my legs closed.  There are still lumps under the skin in a few places but they generally don&#39;t hurt to rub at anymore and we hope they&#39;ll smooth out eventually.  Usually towards evening the day after I&#39;ve massaged things get sore, but the magnitude of that has also reduced.
</p>
<p>
Some days I can sit completely pain free and the other day I crossed my legs without pain as well.  I can also wear tight panties for an hour or two before I start noticing soreness which isn&#39;t intolerable.  And I&#39;ve worked my way up to using my computer from my recliner chair at least as much as I&#39;ve been using it from my bed, which is also a relief because the monitor above the recliner is much nicer.
</p>
<p>
A couple weeks ago my new gyn said the labia skin was looking thin and she said there wasn&#39;t enough &#34;estrogen effect&#34;.  I told her I was using estrogen cream every two days (realistically it averaged more like every 3 days) and she suggested increasing it to every day.  I was surprised how quickly this changed the texture of the skin.  It feels softer and looks less thin in photos.  I always thought estrogen would have a very slow effect and a previous gyn made it sound like it helped a second layer of skin grow in from the edges.  I figured once that happened, the estrogen could be stopped or slowed.  But now it seems I need it possibly permanently?  I&#39;ll ask next time.
</p>
<p>
Internally, things are going much more slowly.  There is always tightness and 1-2/10 pain near the entrance when I put the dilator in or when PT puts her finger in.  She says there&#39;s still scar tissue there and I need to stop when I feel resistance, wait 30+ secs, then continue.  Recently she&#39;s said I should rub it gently with the tip of the dilator.  Last night was the first time I rubbed it for a prolonged period and I found it seemed to loosen things and the pain melted away, so we&#39;ll see how that goes.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s another tight/painful spot about halfway in and another towards the right at full depth.  When the PT got in deep at my last visit I could feel her finger pulling on a tendon that tugged at my butt which felt pretty weird and vaguely sore.  I&#39;ve realized I seem to be irritating that same tendon with the dilator at full depth.  So instead of just pushing the dilator hard to keep it at full depth despite the soreness that provokes, I&#39;ve taken to backing it out an inch, lifting my hips and squeezing my cheeks together, and then trying to relax the muscles as I press it back in.  Usually, that lets me keep full depth with much less pressure and less soreness when I&#39;m done.  With the larger dilator, if I can&#39;t keep it full depth, I just let it sit where it will and try deepening it again a bit later.
</p>
<p>
About a week ago I started using the larger dark blue dilator after the orange and larger purple and last night I got the blue to within half an inch of full depth without a lot of pressure which feels like an accomplishment (even though I&#39;ve had it there before back before I started silver nitrate treatments).
</p>
<p>
My granulation tissue may be completely resolved at this point, or close to it.  I&#39;ve found it remarkable how little smell there is on my dilator the last couple months and I&#39;m fairly sure that the bad smells were coming from bacteria eating blood from granulation.  The problem with panty liners sticking to my labia has also resolved so I&#39;ll blame the granulation for that, as well.  Despite checking a photo for hair before every dilation, I&#39;ve found a hair stuck to my dilator upon removal 2-3 times the last couple months, but the gyn hasn&#39;t found hair inside, so I&#39;ll blame the sticky granulation discharge for trapping hairs in me as well.
</p>
<p>
The only discharge I still get on my pads tends to happen the day after I douche and it&#39;s faintly green or yellow so I think it&#39;s dead bacteria.  If any transudate is leaking out, it&#39;s invisible and non-sticky.  I haven&#39;t had any problem with ID Glide lubricant drying out during dilation sessions that can last up to an hour.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve taken to bracing one palm on the front of the toilet, the other near the back and swinging my hips to let the bidet spray as far forward as possible between the labia.  Sometimes that gets some drops of water on my wrist but I&#39;ve found rinsing that far forward helps a lot with the urine smell that gets on my fingers whenever I check my clit for straightness.
</p>
<p>
Clit has been good the last three weeks and only had problems for a day after trips during the month prior, which I&#39;ll detail below.  I&#39;ve also realized it seems to have a fully straight state which I generally only feel when I wake up in the morning after I&#39;ve had my legs together pushing it out straight all night, and an almost straight state where I can feel some tilt to it but the right edge isn&#39;t caught under skin.  The photo above shows the semi-straight state.
</p>
<p>

<p>
5-11-22: I saw a new gyn recommended by my PT and her opinion was that the granulation tissue at the apex of my canal would never heal unless it was snipped out and then treated with silver nitrate.  So she did that procedure.  I think she forgot to use a numbing agent she usually uses but I just felt a slight weird tug with each snip and a slight burn a minute later which was most likely the silver nitrate.  I had her add Vaseline after the silver nitrate which seemed to help prevent some of the greyness and damaged skin I&#39;ve seen after previous treatments.  Various gyns have always said there was only one growth of granulation but I didn&#39;t think to ask why there are so many pieces floating in her collection jar:

</a>
</p>
<p>
5-15-22: I achieved my first orgasm since my clit injury.  I didn&#39;t notice the left area under my clit bulging like last time I tried masturbating.
</p>
<p>
5-22-22: 1.5 hours of genital electrolysis yesterday. It hurt significantly for her to press/stretch labia in certain places but overall there wasn&#39;t much pain.  I didn&#39;t notice any labia tenerness the next day unlike last time I did electro.
</p>
<p>
6-7-22: I did many hours of driving, sitting, and walking around the last few days.  I was surprised how little discomfort it caused and that my clit was always straight when I checked it.  Then after a long drive home, I found it tilted significantly.  The next day it kept tilting and I kept straigthening it and by the next day it was fine again.
</p>
<p>
6-13-22: Second visit to new gyn.  She tried to use clear medium speculum and it was too tight.  She switched to small metal but had trouble opening it far enough without too much pain.  She said the granulation she removed last time had grown out again, not as long as before but she felt it wouldn&#39;t heal unless we removed it every week or two.  It was very depressing and I felt I would never make progress with dilation until the granulation resolved which would take who knows how long.  She suggested that instead of stopping dilation for three nights after her treatments, I should dilate normally but not push to full depth till night 4.  That seemed to work well to prevent losing progress with stretching wider.
</p>
<p>
6-14-22: Because the gyn had so much trouble spreading the speculum, I decided to start dilating with orange and larger purple instead of smaller purple and orange.  Orange took longer to get in and purple went deeper than expected.  My PT said as long as I back off on pressure with the larger dilator when there&#39;s pain over 2/10, this should be fine.
</p>
<p>
6-15-22: Had problems with clit turning again after driving ~3 hours and sitting for lunch.  This is weird compared to how much sitting and driving I&#39;d done a week before without problems, but maybe I was still healing.
</p>
<p>
6-16-22: It&#39;s getting hard to find painful spots to rub during labia massage.
</p>
<p>
6-18-22: Tried driving without the Twin Cheeks cushion to see if that actually helped my clit but it turned sideways again once I got home so I think things were worse without the cushion.
</p>
<p>
6-21-22: Gyn said granulation hadn&#39;t grown outwards and only needed a silver nitrate treatment which made me happy because the snipping always squicked me a bit.
</p>
<p>
6-22-22: I&#39;ve been feeling really tired most days the last few weeks so I started taking Trazadone to try to sleep better.  It didn&#39;t seem to help with my getting woken ~6am by the sun but it maybe helped me doze to 8-10 and I did feel less tired as if it was giving me sounder sleep or something.  The last few weeks I&#39;ve also stopped needing to get up during the night to pee and I can often last until 8-10 am.  Usually when I wake at ~6 I feel some need to pee but if I ignore it it goes away.  I don&#39;t know what changed because my diet is the same but maybe I somehow trained my mind to ignore the urge until it goes away or maybe something healed.  Either way it&#39;s been very nice.
</p>
<p>
6-28-22: Gyn said there was no granulation to treat!  She said the skin still didn&#39;t look completely normal where granulation had been so she&#39;ll check again in two weeks but it was still great news.  Her speculum went in much more easily with less pain and could be opened wider since I moved to the larger dilators.
</p>
<p>
6-30-22: Started 5mg Lexapro with approval of a new psychologist.  Since I started HRT 3ish years ago, I&#39;ve been a lot more emotional, mostly towards the negative emotions, unfortunately.  I was hoping I&#39;d get used to it and I even took a DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) class a couple months ago to learn skills to cope with emotions, but there were still times where it just felt uncontrollable.  Usually I&#39;d just live with it and it would pass in a few hours, and usually there was a cause when depression was more common, like when my clit was stuck sideways.  But then I had multiple crying breakdowns during that trip on 6-7 without any really great reason other than some disappointments and being around people too much.
</p>
<p>
I realized that my mood swings mostly seem tolerable because I&#39;ve gotten good at avoiding things that I know trigger me, but my emotional reactions to bad or stressful things are really worse than average.  So I decided I had to try the antidepressant.  The last few days I&#39;ve been feeling much less fragile and more awake and motivated to get stuff done but I can&#39;t be sure yet if it&#39;s a placebo effect, getting better sleep on Trazadone, the Lexapro, or some of all three.
</p>
<p>
7-3-22: Almost zero pain during labia massage.
</p>
<p>
7-10-22: I&#39;m seeing mounting evidence that mustard causes me joint stiffness and pain.  I didn&#39;t know you could be allergic to mustard so... watch out!
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I forgot to mention that for the last two months or so, I&#39;ve had a lot less shed hair in the shower drain.  I noticed this around the same time I started brushing my hair much more gently and also being gentle with rubbing in shampoo and conditioner.  This was after I read an article about hair loss saying to be gentle.  I don&#39;t know if being gentle made such a big difference or if maybe I hit a point in my healing where the pain was no longer triggering stress hormones that trigger hair shedding, but either way it&#39;s nice.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for now.  Tune in next time...

Depth is 16cm and it&#39;s still tight.  I keep trying to stretch it too quickly and the skin gets damaged and I have to go back to a smaller dilator for awhile.  It seems that even small amounts of pain during dilation is too much and can damage things.
</p>
<p>
I also keep getting knocked back to a smaller dilator after each silver nitrate treatment.  All my granulation is now resolved except a spot at the deepest part of the canal which will probably need monthly silver nitrate so I&#39;ll make no real progress on dilating up until that&#39;s healed.  I generally heal very slowly compared to most people.
