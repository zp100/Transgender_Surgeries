Hi! I&#39;ve been reading most of you needed 3 months after going back to work. I&#39;m a freelance and have no option to take a leave, but I can work from bed with a light laptop.
</p>
<p>
Do you think working 3-4 h/day the first days 10 days after surgery, and up to 6h/day after the 11th day after surgery could be doable? My project ends in 2-3 months and I really need the money.
</p>
<p>
I would only have to do that and take care of my post-op, I would have someone helping out with all my chores.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?
</p>
<p>
Thanks ðŸ–¤ Anta (they/she)

Hello from Chonburi, I&#39;m currently 19 days post-op and I&#39;m having a hard time juggling work; I&#39;ve had to drop a lot of responsibilities and that caused a lot of problems for my team back home.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really hard to predict how well you will take to surgery. There are some patients bouncing off the walls by day 3, and there are some who can&#39;t leave their bed till week 3.
</p>
<p>
Physical recovery aside, post-op depression can be a real challenge. You&#39;ll be tired and drained, and you will have had undergone a major change to your body. You&#39;ll be in pain or on pain meds that make it hard to think. You will have to plan your life around dilating (at least for suporn clinic patients; I&#39;m not sure about others), and you will have to learn how to do a lot of basic things about your life all over again.
</p>
<p>
I brought work with me to Thailand and trying to juggle that with recovery gave me a lot of stress and anxiety that impeded my recovery. As a freelancer you&#39;d know sometimes work just doesn&#39;t stick to your hours.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t regret having had the surgery, but I regret not giving myself more space to heal and for my body, mind, and spirit to adapt to the change.
</p>
<p>
This is a major milestone in your transition, if you can afford to you should let yourself experience it fully and do it properly.
</p>
<p>
Of course it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re also good to go on day 3 and you can throw out everything I said; but you gotta respect that surgery is a major physical trauma to take.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do it, I&#39;m saying think about whether you really want/need to.
</p>

O, hello, I wonder if we already met in Hotel or not) But the post was about standard inversion, wich probably is probably doesn&#39;t require so much time for recovery

You can know what&#39;s to come but it&#39;s impossible to know how it&#39;ll feel until you&#39;re there.

I think it would be easily doable. Once the drowsiness wore off after surgery I had no issues using my laptop. I did a bit of video editing while still in the hospital the day after surgery and then watched videos all day sitting up in a chair. by 8 days post op I was swinging on a swing in my garden and went on 2 mile long walks. I never had an issue using a laptop.

Thanks for this! I prefer to start progressively and early than having to do full work after weeks or months of not working at all. My job consists mainly on writing docs, planning, writing emails, internet researching... I&#39;ve been doing this for years and it&#39;s not stressful, I even kind of enjoy some of the bits. Spending 3h in all day seems doable to me as they don&#39;t even need to be straight, I can do my own brakes, eat something, take a shower, whatever

I am day six after bottom surgery so still in the hospital; one of my neighbours sounds like they are already back to work with meetings and such.

In the first month-ish, dilating, douching, showering, and such is going to consume about 6 hours of your day; you will probably need more sleep than usual (I was averaging 12-15h a day but that&#39;s an extreme), and you also need to eat and stuff...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also suggest considering that you don&#39;t know how much pain relief you&#39;ll need at first. I got very lucky and was able to manage with just my usual chronic pain pills, but I know tons of people that needed piles of opiates and were loopy as heck.
</p>
<p>
In short, I would suggest you don&#39;t COUNT on it. Not to say it&#39;s impossible, just that you can&#39;t guarantee it. After the first month I would absolutely agree it&#39;s possible, but that first month it&#39;s more than a full time job to take care of the stuff no one else can do for you.

Thank you very much for this very informative reply!
</p>
<p>
When you say first month you count after the first day after the surgery?
</p>
<p>
I usually sleep 10h/day bc I love naps haha I&#39;m used to it, I hope I won&#39;t need more bc otherwise I&#39;ll need to hibernate.
</p>
<p>
Here in the hospital (I&#39;m on my 5th day) haven&#39;t had any pain, and the nurses and doctors were surprised by it. Everyday they checked my pain level in case they needed to supply more painkillers but that was never the case. So I&#39;d say regular painkillers would do the trick and hopefully won&#39;t have so much brain frog. I also had had my split tongue so I&#39;m kinda used to continuous pain.
</p>
<p>
I guess the right answer I&#39;ll have it myself when the time comes, but 12h sleep + 6 dilating and douching and showering and so, if I have someone cooking for me and doing my chores (I have my parents + friends), sounds like 2-4 hours/day during the first 3 weeks are doable?

Oh, nice! Okay, that&#39;s a bit different then. I thought you were planning ahead for a surgery in the next few months.
</p>
<p>
Based on that I could be wrong and you might be totally fine, yes. Just don&#39;t overdo it, that&#39;s how you end up with popped stitches. If your body tells you to rest, REST.
</p>
<p>
Good luck and may the rest of your recovery go just as well.

I was delivering training seminars on zoom from 10 days after, or 9,  i dunno  how do count work. And was working a couple of hours a day, ramping up to basically full time by 3 weeks.  I wasn&#39;t out of the hospital till 5 days post, and I wouldn&#39;t have liked to have done a lot in the first couple of days back at the hotel, but yeah, you could be up to a couple of hours a day by day 10.    With my surface and my ROG Zephyrus giving me kinda-dual monitors,  I was even kinda productive :)

Maybe Iâ€™m crazy, but I went back to light duty and walking around my theme park about 4 weeks after. Thankfully no complications. I too had not much choice, and also I got really boredâ€¦

Update: Day 10 after intervention. I did a couple of hours of work already :) anything that isn&#39;t laying is tiring, and dilations are tough, but having my laptop in bed is perfectly fine!
