So,  on Dec. 15th I had peritoneal pullthrough vaginoplasty with Dr. Stranix at UVA Charlottesville.
</p>
<p>
I have two Befores, one just after the vacuum dressing was removed on day 4 after, and one just now dilating with that last, deepest dot out of sight.
</p>
<p>
I will have a more complete review up later, I promise.  I owe this community a lot.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all for sharing your experiences and before/afters, profoundly.

I was (obviously) circumcised and had an orchi about 18 months prior.

<p>
The red puffiness in the first After is I think due to my being far more allergic to bacitracin than I thought I was.   At least when it is on a cut like to my knee, I usually get 5~7 days before I break out.  Not this time.

Hmm.   Actually I can just make out that last dot on the dilator in the latest photo.   I could not see it live in the mirror through the rim of lubricant.  I am certain it is inside me for most &#34;last halves&#34; of the dilation time of 15min, 3X day.
</p>
<p>
I should add I have had about 3 (?) years of HRT prior.

Destiny, the contact person is always super busy, so if you don&#39;t get a call back immediately just wait a couple days and try again.
</p>
<p>
The best way to reach her is through the MyChart app and they can set that up for you.
</p>
<p>
She is an amazingly kind person, she just has a LOT to do. :)
</p>
<p>
Dr. Stranix is a great person.  He talks to you like you are an actual person and not just a file.  I really feel at ease with him.

Congratulations! I know it&#39;s kind of early, but how was your experience at UVA and with Stranix? Would you recommend him to others? I have a consult with RBBL but I&#39;m looking for alternatives.

I definitely recommend Dr. Stranix.   UVA is a teaching hospital, that does come with a side of idiots not knowing what they are doing or talking about (Dr. Stranix excepted!).

I highly recommend them as well.  Dr. Stranix and his entire staff are amazing.  They are super busy, since they are quickly becoming the main hub for transgender surgery in the Mid-Atlantic.  But I can&#39;t say enough about him and his staff.

Hi! I’m considering having bottom surgery with Dr. Stranix and his team as well! Do you mind if I send you a DM asking some questions and such? (If you’re comfortable, of course!) Thank you!

I have read good things about him in general so far. Does he take insurance or self pay only? Does he require full hair removal or does he do follicle scraping?
