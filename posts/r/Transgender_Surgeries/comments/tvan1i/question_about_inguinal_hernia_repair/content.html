I have a hernia on the left side since before transition and I want to have bottom surgery in the future. I’m concerned with the procedure for hernia repair interfering with eventual options with bottom surgery. I’m specifically concerned with the permanent mesh that is typically used to reinforce the abdominal wall.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone have experience having bottom surgery after hernia repair? In your case, did you have a mesh? Did the repair incision location have any effect on your options for labiaplasty?
</p>
<p>
Thank you all!!!

I had a left-side inguinal repair with mesh a couple of years before a full vaginoplasty. I made my GRS surgeon aware in advance, but they were unconcerned and there was no apparent issue.

No, scrotal graft, but I don&#39;t think it would matter for the hernia repair, I have a friend who had PI with a pre-existing hernia repair.

I had hernia repair in childhood (no net) and SRS well into adulthood. There was no problem. My surgeon was a urologist.
