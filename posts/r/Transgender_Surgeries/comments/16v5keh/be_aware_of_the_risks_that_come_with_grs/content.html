I got my grs two month ago and the injured the rectum. One week after that they noticed that its leaking so they sewed it back together the second time and also had to do a stoma to let the wound heal better. Now two months later it still didn’t heal and I now don’t know what to do. The surgeon was very well picked and had good rates. He also did my FFS and I am happy with the results but this grs operation failed. I just want you to know: even if you do your research right there is always a risk you are taking!!

My surgeon was very clear multiple times about this before surgery. He explained everything that can go wrong and how, and then talks about how recovery works after it happens.
</p>
<p>
This is generally something they (should) do by themselves without it being asked for. In Germany, it’s a legal requirement.

I&#39;m in Spain, my surgeon also made it very clear that this is a possible complication. I even signed a document that I am aware of the risks.

Anything can go wrong in principal, but in practice it happens vastly more often with some surgeons than others. And none of them tell you their individual rates of problems so it makes it far more difficult to work out if they are any good or not.

Mine told me the rates. He’s obligated to as well. And he had very low failure statistics.

My surgeon was very happy to share her own complication rates. Is it really that unusual?

Do a search and see how many you can find who publish results, then compare your surgeon to that to work out how good they are. You won’t get very far. I tried.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think many will tell you in person either, but it’s impossible to say for sure without asking lots of them, so just my guess. Did you ask your surgeon for a breakdown of all complications they had?

I didn&#39;t need to ask her. It was a routine part of her patter at the consultation. Her rectovaginal fistula rate was 1 in 450 which I think is quite a bit lower than average. Perhaps why she was so keen to share? :) She was open about anorgasmia rates too, and the proportion of patients who seek revision.
</p>
<p>
There may have been others but I can&#39;t remember.

1 in 450 is low for sure, there’s plenty of surgeons higher.

Every surgeon I&#39;ve spoken to has been able to quote the occurrence rate of specific complications and make an analysis on if I feel into that risk group or not.

How does one not know what type of surgery we&#39;re getting? Sounds odd to me.  Before I did mine I read so much about it, it was insane.

Right? I’m not here to judge, but babes when you’re gonna be getting something extremely intense done to your body, it’s best to know exactly what they’re doing.

I’ve not had mine yet (stupid waitlists) but I know EXACTLY what I’m getting.

It is a combined method and it means that penile skin is used to create labia while scrotal skin for a vaginal canal. It is very similar to the Thai technique.

I did not have any major complications but people NEED to understand this. It can happen to anyone under any surgeon. THERE IS NO SAFE BET. The chances are fairly low of major complications (~1%) but it can happen to anyone and with a few very rare exceptions (rumer) most surgeons will do just fine and the primary difference is aesthetic in nature, the rest is almost entire up to a huge number of variables, your body and how it heals being the biggest ones. I know some people want x-doctor to feel safe but frankly you are doing your future self a disservice if something does go wrong by going into it with some inflated perfectionistic belief. Almost everyone has some kind of minor complication and vulvas are rarely aesthetically perfect and you can never be 100% sure of what it will look like or how your healing will go. Be mindful and open to the idea that something may go wrong and you will have a much better time coping with the emotional stress that can come because of it.

Everyone is going crazy and want to know the name of the surgeon. But like you and I said: even the best surgeon can make mistakes. And I did my research and many patients I met in the clinic where totally fine

Not name dropping the surgeon is just kinda harmful to the community because you’re witholding important information. People are mad at you because they feel that they should have a right to know which surgeon it is because complication rates when choosing a surgeon is important. If you’re the first botch, yes that’s a mistake by the surgeon, but then what if someone goes to the same surgeon, gets botched, and then another goes there to get botched again because they only saw one other incident because you wouldn’t name drop?
<em>
That’s a trend with the surgeon
</em>
and someone who could’ve been scared off from it by 2 mistakes but not just 1 could get botched because you’re choosing to withold this information. Information about trans care is vital to us and very hard to get a hold of and your choice to not help is quite questionable. If you wanted to keep it private you shouldn’t have made the post in the first place.

Hmmm it’s interesting, at first my gut reaction to your comment as I read through it was “well it’s true, even the da Vinci of surgeons has no control over some of the factors in recovery” but then at the same time shame and embarrassment alone are enough to keep botched surgeries silent. I applaud this person for reminding everyone of the risk, that took balls, hehe op please don’t evicerate me for that, I mean it literally and 1000% as a testament to your character. I would never be able to post what you did, and to then say nahh, it’s no one’s fault these things happen. It’s incredibly humbling. But I’m curious op if you had thought about it from this angle. Essentially could we be enabling dangerous surgeons who push the limits when we don’t report out of shame or in your case out of an abundance of humble pie.

I won’t tell which doctor performed the procedure bc everyone makes mistakes as I said. So choosing a different one doesn’t help. As I mentioned he had good results before and also did my ffs very good

Right, but mistakes happen a lot more with some surgeons than others. And the only way we can find out which surgeons have higher risks of complications is for people to share their experiences. Was it Taskov?

No, you won’t find a surgeon who hasn’t made mistakes. Surgeons who say they never made a mistakes are just lying yk

Yes, I know. But the frequency with which they make mistakes matters. There&#39;s a big difference between making an easily-correctable mistake once a year and botching everyone that comes into your OR.

I can tell you that there are many good results from the surgeon. I am the 1% that had not much luck. Besides they said that the area where there put the vaginal canal was way more thin then usual in others

You have every right to not mention the surgeon and the fact that people are prying is not a supportive way to go about it. I’m sorry you’re going through that, and you’re absolutely right to mention that every surgeon has things that go wrong. I haven’t seen a surgeon yet that doesn’t have wins and fails. Thank you for sharing what you’re comfortable with

&#34;choosing a different one didn&#39;t help&#34; - this is just wrong. Some surgeons have better track records than others. Some particular techniques are safer and more consistent than others. The details matter!
</p>
<p>
If you are unwilling to mention your surgeon, all you are doing is blind fear mongering and that is not helpful for our community.

When I tell you, you will just cross a good surgeon from your list because of my different anatomya as i mentioned and give him a bad reputation. Thats not what i want to

Well, now we know that your surgeon was a man. That narrows it down a bit.
</p>
<p>
Knowing that your surgeon had this complication doesn&#39;t mean crossing him from any list, it&#39;s just a useful piece of information.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve already had my vaginoplasty done so I&#39;m not looking for a surgeon! I just care about the community and want everyone to know as much as possible before they choose a surgeon.

I think nobody thinks and expects that they would have to wear a stoma after vaginoplasty. Rectal injury is a complication that should be addressed more frequently at the doctor&#39;s office.

Right? Like all I did was research and read up on everything. It also helps I&#39;m in a discord group with a lot of experienced people as well.
</p>
<p>
Like this was all my brain could think about so it&#39;s a mystery when some people say &#34;I didn&#39;t know&#34; it&#39;s why the detrans thing is largely a myth* (asterisk pertains to the Enby people who had to go on hormones even though it didn&#39;t align with their gender goals inorder to get bottom surgery)

Thats really unfortunate:(  did they tell you if the stoma was temporay while stuff heals or is it permanent?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious on what type of surgery you had? Was it  PIV, PPV or colon?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having a version of piv with the suporn clinic next year and I would like to know if this is something that could happen with PIV or if it was related to one of the other methods of surgery.

Refusal to name the surgeon.

Unsure of the method.

Post title is phrased as &#34;things might go wrong!!&#34; instead of &#34;this thing went wrong for me&#34; which feels like an attempt at fearmongering.

None of that indicates a troll, it&#39;s a very rare and temporary outcome which can occur even with the best of surgeons, skills, and methods available, which is perhaps why she doesn&#39;t prefer to disclose who did it as it is super unlikely.

Necrosis, particularly clitoral necrosis, which can result in little to no genital sensation. Other risks are bleeding, infection, poor healing of incisions, hematoma, nerve injury, stenosis of the vagina, granulation tissue, inadequate depth of the vagina, injury to the urinary tract, abnormal connections between the urethra and the skin, painful intercourse and anaesthesia risks.

A few things. As their are many techniques really research which is the best option for you; only thing I regret was not doing that much research on different techniques ( I didn’t have complications but really do your research and go to a few doctors) . If one started hormones young say (14-15) best option is the colon method as you just won’t have enough length for Penial Inversion. Remember dialating is important as you can develop Vaginal stenosis. Also hygiene no one ever talks about hygiene you really have to douche 1 a week. As far as risks go with the procedure most common is loss of depth, fistula. And micro rips near the rectum tho for the most part can be fixed if need be. Also no one talks about post surgical depression it’s real, it’s normal no you didn’t make a mistake. But please seek a therapist your mental health is extremely important. And I can’t stress this enough please so your research. If you need to wait a few years wait it out. Being uncomfortable is far better than having long term regrets. Hopes this helps someone.

This is very much a ymmv type of thing.  Not everyone needs to douche, those that do don&#39;t always need to do it often (or on an ongoing basis), and it is always best to try and encourage a natural vaginal biome which largely takes care of the common issues douching is meant to address.

Does no one else find it odd that the same surgeon who did the ffs did the vaginoplasty? Surely a Urologist should be the one creating a canal, not a plastic surgeon. Even urologists have occasional rectal injuries, but I think the stats are better for someone who is trained in working only that area.

Yeah that + the refusal to disclose + not knowing what kind she got. This is a troll.

It is surgery. There are always risks and outcomes unfortunately cannot be predicted or guaranteed ahead of time due to individual healing patterns and unforeseen complications during surgery.  Most of the time everything is just fine (with reputable surgeons), but every once in a while, fate just doesn&#39;t seem to align correctly.
</p>
<p>
I am so sorry that you happened to be one of the unlucky ones.  I hope you are able to find a solution, and put this behind you.  💜💜

I was told of this risk about a dozen times at every step of preparing for this surgery. And they stressed sooo much how I need to be gentle with bowel movements during recovery, lots of colace, and absolutely no &#34;pushing&#34; whatsoever. Id be surprised if it could happen to someone and they not know it was a risk though
</p>
<p>
Im sorry it happened to you, I hope you do heal from it soon, recovery is very tough

Yes and the canal closed fully you can not dilate anymore. It has to be opened again by another surgery if I want to
