I have a very strong, dense, dark beard, relatively lighter complexion, so I&#39;m a good candidate for laser. But what can go wrong? How to avoid potential risks?
</p>
<p>
How do different types of laser affect the removal?
</p>
<p>
How much in advance should I shave? (the morning on the day of laser, day before, right before etc)
</p>
<p>
Do I have to avoid certain skincare before/after?
</p>
<p>
I also heard that sometimes the growth is stopped but the 5 o&#39;clock shadow remains, why is that?
</p>
<p>
Can potential scars and burns be treated successfully with prp?
</p>
<p>
My beard grows so fast. If I shave evening before, the next day there are already small hairs growing out. Will this cause burns?

STAY OUT OF THE SUNLIGHT AFTER LASER!!! Don&#39;t use chemical sunblock as an alternative, keep lasered areas covered from sun exposure.

Thanks :) How long should I stay out of the sun? When is it safe to start using sunscreen again? Fortunately it won&#39;t be hard to keep my face covered because it&#39;s cold and pandemic.

True, one thing I&#39;m thankful for summer&#39;s end (I get full body laser and work outside-yay!). I actually won&#39;t use sunscreen on my face at all and I just wear a hat the entire day. When I get my legs/arms lasered, I usually give it three days of covering up before I go back to using sunscreen.

I agree with rheaplex.
</p>
<p>
Also nothing with retinol.
</p>
<p>
My hair grew fast. Seemed like minutes.
</p>
<p>
Shave the morning of the treatment. My understanding is that the laser follows the hair to the follicle to kill it and if its to long only the shaft gets burned and not the follicle. Also the hair has to be in a &#34;growth phase&#34; because that is when it is connected to the follicle when out of phase the hair shaft is just loose and working its way to fall out before the grow phase starts again for that follicle.
</p>
<p>
That is part of the reason you still get a shadow. Some hairs are not actually alive so they just sit there. Thus multiple treatments to make sure you get all the hairs in the right phase.
</p>
<p>
I unfortunately looked like hitler for a couple of weeks because of timing. Talk about dysphoria and some laughs.
</p>
<p>
I still shaved the next day but I had very little irritation even at high levels.
</p>
<p>
A good practitioner will treat your face with a cooling and soothing topical cream after.
</p>
<p>
I also noticed that for days after lots of hairs that had died would stay in the skin but would not grow like the rest. I found out that I could actually slide these out with tweezers if they did not come out with normal washing. Just don&#39;t tug the hard ones out. They are still connected and yanking them will just prolong how long they last.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps some.
</p>
<p>
It was definitely worth it. I did everything but it takes time. I still go in for some random ones and electrolysis because I had random white hairs.

Thanks a lot for the answer :)! Omg the Hitler stache I can&#39;t üòÖüò≠ How many sessions did it take you? And how long did you wait between sessions? And how long do I have to wait before applying the sunscreen?

Yeah we got rid of the hitler thing fast. Even the nurse thought it was funny.
</p>
<p>
Its been a while but I think it was every 2 to 3 weeks for 8 sessions and a few touch up appointments. I actually did my face and body hair before I even started HRT.
</p>
<p>
I was a hard boiled egg at the time.
</p>
<p>
I did mine in the evenings so I was good to go the next day. I never really changed my care routine outside of no retinol and strong exfoliants. I never skimped on the sunscreen. But again I never got really irritated from it.

We seem to have similar skin and hair and so I‚Äôll tell you what‚Äôs worked for me. Get a really great shave about 3-6 hours before but only shave with the direction of the hair. You want the hair
<em>
just
</em>
at the surface of the skin so it can act like kind of an antenna and channel the heat from the laser to the root so it can cauterize it. Do everything to minimize nicks and irritation but do not use any creams or aftershaves after shaving. You want to use a gentle cleanser and wash your face and rinse it thoroughly with cold water an hour or 2 prior to your appointment. Avoid the sun after like it‚Äôs the devil and wait to use any products on your face for a day or two. Try to avoid shaving for a week (your hairs continue to grow after laser until the root comes out and they fall out, you don‚Äôt want to get one trapped as an ingrown). Oh and drink like a stupid amount of water the day before and morning of. It helps a ton with pain management and inflammation. Take a low dose otc painkiller that you tolerate well before. I use ibuprofen bc it also helps with inflammation. Keep the intensity as high as you can possibly tolerate it. I had a lower setting for my second session bc the pain of the first was awful but I definitely noticed less shedding. Bring something to squeeze and just let them blast away. After, wait a few days and then begin gently exfoliating with a clean cloth and warm water to reduce the chances of getting ingrowns. My office recommends a product called tend skin if you get any ingrown hairs after laser but I‚Äôve never had an issue. I use a strong prescription retinol every other day (stopping two weeks prior to each appointment) and I‚Äôve never had any issues except for normal peeling. Sorry for the ramble, I‚Äôm currently in the shedding phase of my third session and have a lot of thoughts lol.

Omg thanks so much that&#39;s a lot of great insightful advice üòä I&#39;m just confused on whether the hairs should be above the surface or not, some ppl say yes (totally smooth skin) some no. Maybe it depends on the laser type? Did you have any side effects after? How long was it red or sore after the treatment?

<p>
Burning or scarring shouldn&#39;t really occur in most cases. Stick to a reputable tech with good equipment and don&#39;t hide it when the laser fluence reaches pain causing strength.
</p>
<p>
You should shave on the morning before treatment. If there are hairs above the surface, that part will absorb the laser first and probably shrivel off before the heat is fully transferred down the hair shaft.

Tnx for the answer :)
</p>
<p>
The thing is all the salons I&#39;ve contacted have never done male beard and are afraid to do it ü•¥
</p>
<p>
You mean I should ask the tech to lower the strength if it&#39;s too painful?
</p>
<p>
As for the hairs above surface, on some places it says they should be above üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è maybe it depends on the laser?!

Scarring was more common on older ruby lasers, I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re even considered safe any more.
</p>
<p>
You want alexandrite,  Nd:YAG or diode (although the fluence of some diode lasers is too low for some people&#39;s hair)
</p>
<p>
When you first start treatment, the tech will do some patch tests at different power levels and ideally they want the highest level that does not burn you or cause you too much pain. Since most of the heating happens below the skin surface, burns may not be visible so they must be guided by the client and their pain levels. At most, you should have what looks like a sunburn, possibly with heat rash bumps, that fades in a day or two.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re getting electrolysis, then the hair needs to be above the surface, a laser technician saying that does not sound right at all.
</p>
<p>
-Edit- if you&#39;re having trouble finding a salon to treat you, look into places that advertise both laser hair and tattoo removal. The same laser equipment can be used for both in some cases with different settings and they may be used to more AMAB clients.

Everyone else pretty much said what I had to say. I just wanted to say I actually started my transition with laser hair removal. It was awkward for me having a patchy beard so now is the time to do that because face masks. I wish wearing masks in public was socially acceptable back when I was getting my face laser done. Happy for the people that can do it now though.
</p>
<p>
In the end though it is so worth it. My body/face hair dysphoria was terrible before and now I barely even remember I used to have it. I‚Äôm getting electrolysis to finish up my face/genital areas but doing laser really thinned things out for the electrolysis cavalry to pick off the remaining stragglers. üòú

I can imagine it makes such a big difference especially if you&#39;re naturally on the hairer side like myself! It&#39;s my number one hassle, dealing with all the shaving and irritation and bullshit üò≠ Oh I couldn&#39;t wait to laser my beard away and then last winter I went for a job in a tropical region 6 months haha and then I came back here to hot weather again... Now it&#39;s finally winter and Corona masks, cold weather, make it ideal for laser üòÆ

IPL is worthless.
</p>
<p>
I shave just before.
</p>
<p>
Don‚Äôt use a chemical exfoliant a couple of days before/after. Don‚Äôt use anything with alcohol or perfume in it for a couple of days after. Wear an alcohol/perfume free sunblock fur a couple of days after.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after each treatment you‚Äôll have some dead hairs that will take several days to fall out. It‚Äôs not a long-term thing (although in my experience can be up to two weeks).

Thanks a lot for your answer :) I need to check if my sunscreen has alcohol/parfume in it!  How many sessions did it take you? I have read that shaving right before can be dangerous because of micro scars or something, but you haven&#39;t had any issues? Edit: omg both my sunscreen and panthenol cream contain alcohol and parfume

Hmm I don‚Äôt know about micro scars. Now I am nervous. :-D I‚Äôm eight sessions in and getting good results. Ive heard anywhere from 6 to 20 depending on who I‚Äôve asked. Usually laser first then electrolysis. If you can bear to, take photos before each session so you can track progress over time. I found the first few sessions didn‚Äôt seem to do much, and the last few didn‚Äôt seem to do much either, but in between was an amazing difference. Listen to your laser tech, not to me, and ask them about anything you are concerned about.

That&#39;s a great idea, i will take pics!  Idk I know it&#39;s unrealistic but I feel like after 2 treatments it will be all gone ahaha because they&#39;re so thick and dense and it&#39;s so painful üò©
