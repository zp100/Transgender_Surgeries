So I have finally been able to get confirmation from my insurance on which surgeons are covered for my SRS and the only one is Dr Maurice Garcia who operates out of Ciders here in LA.
</p>
<p>
I have been trying to get more information in his process and results from his surgery. I saw one post op photo in a video on YouTube from a conference he spoke at but that doesn’t do much for me.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any experience with Dr Garcia and has actually had surgery I’d love to hear your thoughts and feelings about it. The surgeon I originally picked was Dr Ley in AZ because I’ve seen her work in person and it always looks amazing but there’s no way it would be covered by my insurance.
</p>
<p>
Anyway thank you in advance for all of the info!

Bad news. From what i got during my interview with him; the look my doctor gave me when i mentioned i was considering him; and from what a girl who had a disastrous surgery with him* recounted directly to me. he promoted vulvoplasty but use a term: &#34;zero depth&#34; instead. look around the LA area; UCLA has a trans*program. * look up garcia on Susans: &#34;Honestly, I would NOT recommend him, unless you have no other choice. The only good thing I can say is that the wait time was relatively short. The person who got a call/text I guess is one of the lucky few.. I guess he must like you a lot! For me, he has ignored my concerns. I had gender reassignment/vaginoplasty done a month ago. I developed a rectovaginal fistula which I am dealing with with other doctors, and he doesn&#39;t even want to respond to my emails. Before that, I had random heavy bleeding the day after they removed the catheter. It was bleeding heavily for 3-4 days, a few times a day it would start to bleed when I was walking and I lost tons of blood, many paper towels soaked with blood each time it happened. He told me to come down there so that he can explore the problem, put me under anesthesia, check out the area, etc, he said he would be there at 3:30 the day I came down and have an operating room available. I drove 6 hours, got there, and he didn&#39;t feel like showing up so I stayed overnight and the next day he didn&#39;t even want to see me, he had one of his staff just take a quick look at me and make sure I wasn&#39;t dying. He eventually came in for a few minutes and just looked at it quickly and sent me home. Also, the results look really bad. Really bad. I would say a 3/10 in terms of appearance. It looks nothing like a vagina, actually. I would be HAPPY to share pictures,

Unless you really can&#39;t wait, I would NOT recommend Dr. Garcia&#34;

Yeah I saw this thread which is what prompted me to look more into. I’ve seen some rather poor reviews of his work to say the least but have yet to really see any photos. As much as I want the surgery I’d honestly prefer to wait until I can go to the surgeon I want which would be Dr Ley.
</p>
<p>
I’m in the process of getting an out of network surgeon approved for FFS and if that works out I might try to get approval for Dr Ley. This is a huge surgery and even having the slightest concern about the surgeon to me is a no.

Oh gosh. That is never a good comparison when speaking about someone’s vagina. I’m going to stay far far away from him because it seems he isn’t really cut out to be performing the operation. When I saw the video of him speaking at a conference he also said it wasn’t possible to have the vagina self lubricate and that’s when I was already questioning his abilities.
