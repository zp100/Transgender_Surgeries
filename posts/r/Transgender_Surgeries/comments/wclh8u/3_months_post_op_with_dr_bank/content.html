Look at my profile for 1 and 2 months post op.
</p>
<p>
I can orgasim now through masterbation but during sex it&#39;s hard since I am still healing so other people are careful not to hurt me.

Were you circumcised before? What&#39;s masturbation like where do you stimulate?

Sorry, I&#39;m just really thinking of going to Bank. You look amazing BTW.

Your results are literally my goals with SRS, Dr. Bank did an excellent job with your vulva (especially with the labia minora), I hope your recovery continues to be good and calm

Not OP, but I am 2 months post op from Dr Bank.  Dilation is a bitch. It&#39;s not particulary hard for me, but for the first 3 months, it&#39;s 3 times per day.  Given that it takes about 45 mins from setup to cleanup each time, that&#39;s a huge chunk of my day.
</p>
<p>
From 4-6 months, you can dilate 2x/day, and then after 6 months, it&#39;s 1x/day until the end of the first year, when you only need to dilate 2 or 3 times per week.
</p>
<p>
The dilation itself is a bit painful for me, but not terribly so.

I&#39;m a lesbian, so I don&#39;t know how sex with a penis will feel, but I&#39;m still in the recovery time where the guidelines of the clinic say no penetrative sex.
</p>
<p>
That said, most of the girls that I have talked with that had earlier surgeries with Dr Bank say the sex is great.  The key here is that the dilators are solid acrylic dildos, basically, with no curve, no give, or anything like that. The intent of dilation is to break up any internal scar tissue, and maintain or increase depth.  My depth is 7.25 inches, which is pretty common for Dr Bank.
</p>
<p>
I imagine PIV sex will be good, for anyone interested in that, because a penis, even when hard, is still flexible, soft on the outside, curved, and has some give.
</p>
<p>
As for how the dilators feel?  Well, when inserted, and past the scar tissue, they feel good. Not sexy good, but a good, comfortable feeling of being full, and not in a bad way. I can say that as the nerve endings for my clit reconnect, that also feels good when I touch it, good in a sexy kind of way.

Great! Also I notice you say “past the scar tissue”. Does scar tissue just form at the entrance? Or throughout

mostly inside. some near the entrance (but you can&#39;t see it) and some further in.  It&#39;s just part of the Suporn technique at the Suporn Clinic in Thailand, where Dr Bank is the surgeon there, now that Dr Suporn has retired.  Dr Bank has been doing this for about 6 years, and he is really, really good.

Hey, can I ask how you handled hair removal (if there was any in the buttcrack, around the genitals) as I would love to laser the buttcrack cuz I can’t shave there often but I know they don’t advice to laser the perineum nor genitals and I don’t know what to do or how far to laser and if the only option for the rest is electrolysis, I’m planning to have surgery there late next year. Also can I ask what you’re preferences were (sensibility, depth or aesthetic) and how much depth did you have? Thanks for any input and congrats, it looks amazing!

You can laser the area, you just need to stop 6 months before the surgery. I still have some here in the vulva entrance but it&#39;s easy to pluck until it can be electrolysised (6 months post op).
</p>
<p>
My  preferences were sensation, aesthetics, then depth.

I have about 17cm of depth, but it&#39;s hard for a dick to get to get past 14cm unless I recently dilated as the &#34;last inch&#34; has scar tissue that needs to be streched.
<br>
This will get better over time as I heal.

Laser and electroylis is fine as long as you stop 6 months before surgery. The technique means no hair will grow in the canal but they don&#39;t remive hair in the area that becomes the vagina introitus (the pernium is flipped down). So it&#39;s good to remove hair from there.
