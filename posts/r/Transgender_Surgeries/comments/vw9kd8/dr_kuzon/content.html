i had a zero depth surgery from him in january of 2020. recovery was very rough and the team of nurses were kind, but seemed rather ignorant when it came to caring for me in the hospital. when i had first woken up from anesthesia, i was in a completely separate part of the hospital and away from my parents. i woke up in the worst pain i’ve ever felt in my life and had a very rude nurse who dismissed everything i tried to say, which was very hard because my throat and mouth were so dry and sore. she refused to get me water and eventually just walked away and left me there for a long time. my mom finally found me and tried asking around for any other nurses to help me and nobody showed up. once i had gotten into my room for the week, things got better and the two nurses i had for all of the days were incredibly sweet and actually made me cry multiple times because of how nice they were. after about 4-5 months after, i noticed the healing come to an abrupt stop. everything was still numb/hypersensitive/bruised for the rest of 2020. the labia just looked like loose scrotal tissue and the clitoris was way to big to the point of it jutting out of its hood and causing pain when it rubbed against my clothing. my urethra was alarmingly asymmetrical which made it very difficult and messy to use the bathroom. the clitoral hood came undone and was completely split into two asymmetrical flaps of loose skin and there were two large painful knots of scar tissue on either side closer to my legs. when i brought up my concerns to kuzon, he said he didn’t see anything wrong which was extremely alarming. he said he could do a revision to try and fix some things, so i had another surgery this past january and it didn’t fix anything. everything literally looked exactly the same and the numbness/pain still hasn’t gone away. i went back in for a checkup a couple months ago and he straight up told me that it wasn’t possible for it to be numb and painful at the same time in different areas which made me burst into tears from frustration. he even said “what do you want me to do?” as if something was my fault, which pretty much resulting in my mother and i storming out of his office because of his attitude towards problems that were caused by him. i made an appointment with Dr. Shakir at henry ford and things were immediately different. he works with another Dr. named Garcia who also does transgender surgeries and i had a vocal feminization surgery from her and it was very successful, so i knew my way around their facility/office. dr shakir was very kind and considerate and genuinely empathized with me and seemed so much more knowledgeable than Kuzon. he gave me an exam and was concerned for the same things that i was and i have made plans to have yet another revision through him. in regards to any sexual pleasure, things have been very difficult and frustrating. arousal is minimal and any attempt at masturbating is very exhausting and awkward with a underlying bruised feeling on either side of my labia. sex with my girlfriend who is also transgender is also very awkward and minimal for both of us and i have yet to orgasm from sex with her. i am autistic and extremely sensitive to surgeries and doctors offices so all of this back and forth over the past two years has absolutely exhausted me and sent me into a sort of burnout phase. i felt worse than i did before surgery because any dysphoria i felt used to be combated by the hope of getting surgery, but after having two surgeries in the span of a year and having neither work out has been absolutely crushing and i’ve become so drowned in defeat and depression that i have fallen into thoughts of suicide as well. things in my life have slowly been getting better because of life with my girlfriend, but there’s still a sense of sadness in the back of my mind because of my body and experience with Kuzon. i’m hopeful for a revision from Dr. Shakir and i have a lot of trust and confidence put into him already.

I have met several times with Dr. Shakir and can attest to his empathy and determination to excellence. Also Dr. Garcia is one of the kindest surgeons. I have had one round of FFS with her and am scheduled for a 2nd round in August. She is amazing.
