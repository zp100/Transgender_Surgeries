I didn&#39;t have any brow work done, but Spiegel did my nose (and other stuff).  You need to be very specific with him, and I suggest getting virtual FFS done to show him what you are looking for.  Here&#39;s a little blog I wrote about my FFS journey:

No - he is not bad. I had FFS with him back in August and I’m happy with my results. I went with him
<em>
because
</em>
of his reputation for subtlety. As far as I’m concerned and with limited outside-world data (because COVID), my face now passes - it’s feminine enough that I’m no longer worried about it. A friend told me I look like my cis sister now. Of course, I can only speak of my experience. I plan to write a full positive review one of these days.

That&#39;s reassuring. How was his forehead work (if you had it)? That&#39;s mainly what I&#39;m concerned about. As I said I have a very large brow ridge and I&#39;m afraid if he is &#34;subtle&#34; I&#39;ll be spending 30k just to come out with a
<em>
smaller
</em>
brow ridge, instead of no brow ridge.

Yes, I had forehead work and it was one of the most dramatic changes. I wore glasses always before FFS - now I’ve bought (bifocal) contacts. He did the incision behind and in-front of my hairline - he advanced my scalp in the in-front parts. Then he cut out the forehead piece, reshaped it, and put it back in with screws and bone cement. And also smoothed out my edges elsewhere on my forehead. My brow ridge wasn’t extremely prominent before but now I consider myself as not having a ridge at all.

I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;ve been botched by Bart and I have no idea if I can be repaired. All those who claimed to have been botched by Spiegel went for revision and they are fine afterwards. A truly badly botched surgery is often hard to fix if at all. Also none of them died or ended up in a coma and such. So he may not be good anymore but I don&#39;t think he is as bad or evil like Bart.

He’s not bad . Just not worth all that money . You can pay fraction of the cost and be sure your going to come out looking like a woman 100%

He does good forehead work in regards to the actual bone I’ll give him that, as a former patient of his. Not so much loving the fact I have to wait a year to get a revision on my hairline done by someone else. Me and many other patients I’ve seen have the exact. same. scar. Look at Gigi gorgeous video on it if you want to see what I’m talking about she went to him too

I have a friend who went to spiegel and likes her surgery results, I wouldn’t go to him myself after consulting with him, but I don’t think he’s bad.

I called their office and they told me they don&#39;t do any x rays prior to surgery, he just cuts in and goes at it without mapping it out first. That was a big red flag for me and I decided to discontinue any interest in spiegel clinic. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s good or bad I didn&#39;t go, but I was told to blacklist any surgeon that doesent want x rays prior to cutting you open and reconstructing your bones.

Hismreputation is for subtle results.  Therefore if you want aggressive work, I’d be sure to communicate it.
