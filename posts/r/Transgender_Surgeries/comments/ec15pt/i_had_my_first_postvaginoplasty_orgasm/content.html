This is amazing and a big step! I bet you feel a big relief from all the anxiety about it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a cis female but I find a small vibrator on your clit makes it a ton easier than your fingers. But if you want to use your fingers your clit is very sensitive and you would want to rub either back and forth, side ways or in circular motions on the outer part of your clit, right where you were placing the pillow to grind in.
</p>
<p>
Congrats and go have fun!!

Thanks for the advice!! Is there a vibrator you recommend? My friends are telling me to get a Magic Wand but they&#39;re pretty expensive. Then again it might be worth it.

Oh man the magic wand looks amazing!! I agree it is a little expensive.
</p>
<p>
If you decide on the bullet its small and rocket charged lmao.  Not all of them are.
</p>
<p>
If you decide on a longer vibrator I recommend the clitoral vibrators or the rabbits. The clitoral ones will suck on your clitoris almost like the same sensation from getting head.
</p>
<p>
The rabbit ones you can insert the dildo for penetrastion and the extra rabbit part is for clitoral sensation.
</p>
<p>
I bought a small love bullet from Meijer for about $12.95. It has like 10 different settings and they are crazy!!
</p>
<p>
The ones on Adam and Eve are about the same price for the small ones. They can be indescreet if you want to travel with them.
</p>
<p>
This website you can find the magic wands too!!

If you get the Magic Wand (beware of substandard copies) get this:
<a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/router-speed-control-43060.html">https://www.harborfreight.com/router-speed-control-43060.html</a>
it will give you much better control over the vibration speed which can be a bit too much at times and make you numb before you cum and ain&#39;t nobody got time for that!

Nice price, I understand how they can be helpful. As an electronics geek, I made my own many years ago. Basically it was a simple light dimmer circuit. later on I added a couple of &#34;555&#34; ICs to give it pulsed on/off control too.

Lol, sounds like you&#39;ve got a gadget you could sell. My degree is in electronics and I remember those little 555 timers!

Those 555 chips ares still handy for all sorts of apps. If I were a bit more up to speed, Id try using those PIC chips, and be able to do different pulse patterns, etc. I also developed this trick where I switch a diode across the TRAIC that does the speed and pulse control. The diode makes the vibrator remain ON, even the the TRAIC is gated off. That way the vibrator instead of jumping from OFF to whatever ON intensity/interval, it remains ON, in low speed mode, then jumps to whatever the TRAICs on value is. I enjoyed MANY Hrs of fun w/ that ;) But ya know, since transitioning, between HRT and my Orchi, those old AC powered vibrators  dont feel the same. I need something that has a higher frequency of vibration, that I get from those little battery powered ones. Ive tried experimenting w/ a small modified 12VDC to 120AC inverter, to provide a higher Line frequency than 60 Hz. But those vibrator motors only have a limited &#34;bandwidth&#34; they can respond to. Even when an idea doesnt pan out, R&amp;D is so much FUN :)

I just got the OG magic wand (cordless, $100) recently, I&#39;m pre-op right now but it&#39;s absolutely unbelievable what it can do to you, I can&#39;t recommend it enough!

I got my magic wand off of Liberator, I think it was $55. Target&#39;s website sells them, and for the lowest price. I live in a State where sex toys are technically illegal, so many companies will not ship them here.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m still pre-op but love my magic wand, totally worth it.

is incredible, and way more affordable than the Magic Wand. It&#39;s rechargeable and waterproof, Plenty Strong, and it&#39;s way more portable - both my partners and I absolutely love them.

Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m an afab non binary person, but I maybe have some tips for you.
</p>
<p>
First of all, not every possibility has to feel good to you. I don&#39;t enjoy using my fingers and I usually don&#39;t cum from that. But rubbing something like a pillow or using a vibrator usually does it for me.
</p>
<p>
So you should try out different things and see what feels best for you alone and also try things out with a partner if that&#39;s what you want. Doing it yourself and doing it with another person are at least for me 2 very different things.
</p>
<p>
When you experiment you will notice if you like less or more pressure or friction, if you need lube or not and how you come easiest or most intense. And then you can build up on that.
</p>
<p>
With vibrators maybe start with something that is not too expensive while still good quality silicone. It should have some variation in intensity. Most of them also have some kind of vibrator pattern variation, which does nothing for me personally, but maybe it does for you. A magic wand feels a lot different than a bullet vibrator and both are again different from a satisfyer. You might prefer a &#34;low&#34; rumbly feeling, or a &#34;high&#34; buzzing one, or a sucking sensation. Also it can be a nice feeling to not only hold the vibrator onto your clit, but also rub the area with it. Different toys are for different needs. I have bought some toys in my life that were completely not compatible to what I like, so prepare to leave some money in the industry. x)
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that every clit and vagina is different and you will have to find your way. Take your time, treat yourself and make love to yourself. I wish I could explore masturbation again for the first time, it&#39;s a magical journey. &lt;3
