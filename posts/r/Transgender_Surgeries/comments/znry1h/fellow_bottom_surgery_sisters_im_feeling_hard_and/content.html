I had gender confirmation surgery 3 weeks ago and I‚Äôm healing well. I have been feeling horny lately, I WILL NOT ACT ON IT, until after my doctor gives the clear and that‚Äôs going to be 9 more weeks. But I woke up this morning and dilated and during I started feeling like I had a hard on. Then today walking around I got the same feeling. Is this what getting turned on feels like? Sorry if weird just dunno what this feeling is and don‚Äôt really wanna ask my surgeon for this silly question.

So I notice when I get aroused my clit feels a little swollen, but when I&#39;m really aroused I can notice a pulsating throb in my vulva area. Don&#39;t know if this is close to what you&#39;re experiencing but it&#39;s my experience

it could be left over erectile tissue. I used to get a similar feeling post op but over a year - 1 1/2 years it went away, My surgeon said it was because of swelling.

Hazel is exactly right about it going away. It&#39;s normal at first and aside from, back on hormones after being off them, leftover tissue, swelling all that jazz. The most important thing to remember is this. Your brain is rewiring to the after market parts and it&#39;s gonna take some time.

There&#39;s still erectile tissue downstairs.  So when you get horny blood will flow there .  (This happens in cis woman too)
</p>
<p>
After about 3 months my brain re mapped things so it feels less like a boner now. üôÇ

I had PPV if that matters. I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve had a near constant erection since surgery. Like not necessarily horn ness just that feeling of tightness. It‚Äôs slowly gotten better and they said it‚Äôs normal but still exists.
</p>
<p>
As for horniness itself it sucks. About 4 weeks post op libido came back hard (especially being back on hormones a few weeks). So frustrating not being able to do much about it. Not helped by the fact arousal makes dilation easier imo so I‚Äôm almost encouraged to indulge it some.

FYI cis clits (i own one) function basically the same as a penis except for things coming out of them. Throbs, gets hard and erect and swollen, and pulses and pumps during orgasm. We wake up with throbbing boners too. This is why vagina chaperones are always pissed about people not treating clits the same as a penis in bed. Many of us rub them the same and stimulate under the head too, the motions are just smaller. Clits need just as much love lol.

Now you just have a small one üòÄ. Welcome!

Our clits are made from the heads of our penises and when we were aroused before the heads would swell with blood. Our clits do the same thing! That is what is happening now and is normal.  Definitely listen to your Dr so that you can heal properly but there isn&#39;t any reason that you can&#39;t explore your new lady bits! I found that I started to explore while dilating because I didn&#39;t want to waste the amount of lube I was using.

Its worth considering that the penis and cis clit are pretty much the same thing, only the clit is smaller üòâ

It‚Äôs not an unusual sensation. The first few months post-op I felt a near constant sense of pressure beneath my mons. Ice packs helped considerably.
</p>
<p>
It even got so bad that I would dream my üçÜ was still there and would pop out at the most inopportune moments. It was not a pleasant dream.
</p>
<p>
As time has passed (I‚Äôm 57 weeks post) the sensation has diminished.
</p>
<p>
Just be patient and follow your surgeon‚Äôs directions. It‚Äôs going to get sooooo much better!

It&#39;s not necessarily a feeling of being hard... But you can definitely feel being engorged blood. When women get aroused this is what happens.

I still have my original plumbing. Both pre and post (but especially post) testosterone I have always felt hard when I‚Äôm really turned on. The clitoris definitely gets stiff when sexually aroused. It swells up to about 3x the size than when not turned on. So don‚Äôt let this make you feel dysphoric. It‚Äôs totally normal for everyone.

You&#39;re still going to feel the blood flowing down there but also you&#39;re still really swollen in general. It&#39;ll feel weird for a bit until after all the swelling goes down. It can take a couple of months to feel &#39;right&#39;

Yah this is normal. You will still have swelling so any small increase of blood flow will be magnified by the swelling

I definitely felt that &#39;hardness&#39; earlier on in recovery (i&#39;m 4.5 months post right now), not even just while aroused - it&#39;s definitely gotten less pronounced i think as swelling has gone down, but i&#39;ve also gotten use to it. there&#39;s still muscle/erectile tissue around there, which cis women have as well

Thanks everyone! I think it was just a weird feeling. I‚Äôm still getting the sensation but not as much as a few nights ago. Probably didn‚Äôt help my boyfriend was around and I hadn‚Äôt seen him in a week. But it‚Äôs all good and hopefully my brain makes the boner feeling go away soon. I appreciate you all so much for your insight and guidance.
