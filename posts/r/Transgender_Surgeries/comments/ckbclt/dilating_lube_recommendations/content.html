I’m 11 weeks post op SRS with Chettawut and the QC lube I bought in Thailand is about to run out. What brands of lube do y’all prefer to dilate with?
</p>
<p>
I tried astroglide but it’s not very smooth and it’s hard to apply to the dilators.
</p>
<p>
I heard some girls use coconut oil to dilate but I haven’t done any research on that yet.

You&#39;d need to use a lube without silicone for a while yet.
</p>
<p>
Also, look in the wiki

Thank you! I didn’t know there was a portion devoted to lube.
</p>
<p>
About how long until I can branch out from water-based lube ?

Going by an interview with Suporn (in the pdf on him) when it&#39;s healed which is around 3 months. Actually that&#39;s only 12 weeks...

My favorite line for dilating is Slippery Stuff Gel. It&#39;s thick, but very slick and doesn&#39;t contain glycerin so it won&#39;t get sticky. It&#39;s also pretty inexpensive as far as good lube goes, you can get 16oz bottles for about $15, and 16oz two-packs or 32oz bottles for around $23 on Amazon.

My surgeon recommended Surgilube, and that is what I&#39;ve used ever since. My surgeon said I could switch now, but I&#39;ve just stayed with it because it&#39;s familiar and it works. I wouldn&#39;t dream of using it for sex however.

I think its personal preference but here is what Ive tried:
</p>
<p>
Surgilube - slightly thicker than QC worked OK but it was kind of sticky i guess? KY UltraGel - slippery and watery worked well but messy KY Jelly - as close to QC as ive found. Slightly thinner than QC which is fine by me. Works pretty well and isnt too messy.
</p>
<p>
So far ill be sticking with KY Jelly until i decide to mix things up again. Either way you should experiment if you are able to find lube that works for you.

There is a lube available (I think only) in Scandinavia, water based, made by ACO called Glidslem.
</p>
<p>
Great stuff! It is a little thicker than &#34;sex shop&#34; lubes, but works really really well, it is the same stuff the hospitals use (at least in Linköping, Sweden).

My favorite lube is sutil luxe, it’s a wonderful lube along with being mostly plant based, the correct ph for your vagina, and basically tasteless and odorless. The other lube I liked using was sliquid sassy until I realized it was making my vagina smell kinda gross.

Sliquid Sassy is another favorite of mine, but the odor is a little odd. Not horrible IMO, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll buy anymore after I&#39;m done with this bottle. I mostly use Slippery Stuff Gel with a few drops of the Sliquid Sassy, which is a
<em>
really
</em>
slippery combo, but the Sliquid does have the weird smell thing. It&#39;s a shame too, because I think that lube is probably the closest to natural vaginal lubrication that I&#39;ve ever tried.
