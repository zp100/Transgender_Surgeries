This happened in April or March. But life circumstances didn’t really allow me to fully process my anger &amp; collect my thoughts on this until just now.
</p>
<p>
I had an appointment for FFS consultation that I set 6 months ahead of time, then life intervened and I was made homeless around the time of my appointment. I still made pains to get to this appointment because it was in my calendar and I didn’t want to miss this surgery.
</p>
<p>
They called me the
<em>
day of
</em>
my appointment to tell me I’m going to have to come in at a different time (which I was not able to meet). I didn’t find out any of this until I arrived since I had to change my number (which is not their fault, but I wouldn’t have been able to meet later even if they did reach me).
</p>
<p>
The worst was that receptionist. She was patronizing. Every time I expressed frustration and exasperation she interjected with “time out! time out!” Complete with the football hand signal. I was making pains to ensure she knew my anger wasn’t at her, but at the hospital for such a short notice. Still. Every time I opened my mouth, “time out! Time out!”
</p>
<p>
She seemed frustrated to even have to speak with me, and did not seem to understand why I’d be upset at all. She seemed to take my criticisms of the hospital personally, which was weird.
</p>
<p>
When I told her I couldn’t meet at that time with the other dude from the office, she said “well the next available appointment for Kaiser is in October.” I told her I don’t have Kaiser, I have Medicaid now. She didn’t even check the computer before correcting herself, “the next available appointment for Medicaid is in September.” I do not understand why it makes a difference, but thanks I guess? Of course this conversation netted like 5 or 6 “time outs” from this receptionist trying to even get this information out of her.
</p>
<p>
I told them to take me off the list and I’m just gonna go someplace else—they made me that angry. The sheer lack of compassion and apparent frustration from this clinic angered me that much. I don’t care how short-staffed they are or how bad I need this surgery. I’m not gonna let somebody “time out!” me during a time when I am clearly struggling and reasonably upset at such a bureaucratic mishap.
</p>
<p>
So I guess I’m going someplace else.
</p>

I want to pre-empt any feedback or opinions on how I handled this with a disclaimer: this has been my experience and yours may vary greatly. I’m sure Dr. Nuara himself is a skilled surgeon. My anger is directed squarely at Virginia Mason.
</p>
<p>
Plus, I’m about to be on an insurance plan that’s much more widely accepted than either Kaiser or WA Medicaid, so I have no incentive to put up with this bureaucratic ineptitude on a surgery where I
<em>
really
</em>
cannot afford it. I’ll wait for this to be done right.

Dr. Nuara is one of the least considerate doctors I’ve ever met…your interaction seems to be a product of the environment he sets forth. I saw him for a general surgery but medical ethics should bleed over. I am sorry to hear how you were treated and know there are better places out there.
