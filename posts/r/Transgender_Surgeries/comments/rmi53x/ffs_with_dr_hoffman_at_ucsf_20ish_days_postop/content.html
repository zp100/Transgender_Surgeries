My experience with Dr. Hoffman @ UCSF:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
SOME BACKGROUND:
</p>
<p>
To give you some background I’m a 40 year old female, I transitioned when I was 22, and FFS has always been on my bucket list. When I first transitioned, FFS was only done by a handful of doctors in the world, at least ones that were any good. Now at UCSF alone they have 3 doctors you can pick from. I actually flew out to Thailand to have SRS over a decade ago because that was basically the only good option at the time. I’m so glad things are much better for everyone and all this stuff has become way more accessible.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
PROCEDURES:
</p>
<p>
Contouring of the forehead with a brow lift.
</p>
<p>
Rhinoplasty with lip lift.
</p>
<p>
Fat Grafting to my lips and cheeks.
</p>
<p>
Jaw and chin recontouring.
</p>
<p>
I think he also injected some botox in my jaw muscles to further reduce it&#39;s profile.
</p>
<p>
Liposuction under the chin with a tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
ISSUES SO FAR:
</p>
<p>
I expected swelling and numbness on the top of my head.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t expect my chin to be numb as well as a portion of my lower lip.
</p>
<p>
I also didn’t expect to have double vision. One of my eyes seems rotated a few degrees sideways and everything has an “X” pattern to it.
</p>
<p>
The unexpected issues are not uncommon, and I’m told they will fully resolve within a few weeks to a few months. All the numbness is expected to go away.
</p>
<p>
I am also noticing a weird dimple near my forehead incision where the soft tissue under the skin appears to be gone. It kinda looks like I have a dent in my head though it’s hard to get a good picture due to its location. I think I have to wait a bit to see where this lands.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
THOUGHTS SO FAR:
</p>
<p>
Dr. Hoffman was very friendly, attentive, polite, and calm. He is certainly highly skilled and knowledgeable in his field. I also found communication generally good when engaged, but at times lacking, dismissive, or vague. Same with the clinic staff. I had to be firm and clear about a lot of things or I would get push back. My biggest criticism is just the lack of patient education. There were no materials prepared to read about the procedure or what to expect. Surgeons in my experience don’t do the same things the same way, so there is a definite need to communicate process and expectations. There were no curated examples of his work in the office ready to show anyone, and certainly nothing online. The UCSF website has some FFS results, but they don’t seem related to him. I had to ask Dr. Hoffman to show me results, and he took me to his computer and went through patient files that included mid-surgery pictures along with the results. I appreciate that he did this, but it kinda raised an eyebrow for me.
</p>
<p>
I liked his work and that’s what sold me. The thing that stood out was his ability to preserve the natural features of patients while still making them look fem. He seemed in general a bit conservative or subtle for my tastes, but it seemed the people who were strong communicators had better outcomes that were more inline with my own expectations. I don’t think Dr. Hoffman did a good job of breaking down things for me or trying to understand me unless I pressed. I felt like I had to do a lot of work to make sure we were on the same page. I did advocate for him to be much more aggressive with the bone work and brow lift. I really wanted to see a big change. I ended up making my own bullet point list of what I was expecting just for clarity. He seemed to appreciate that.
</p>
<p>
The communication issues extended to his staff and even with aftercare. I walked out of the first consult unaware that it was meant to be the only consult before surgery. They were not pre-emptive with information and I had to ask about everything I could think of. At no point did him or his staff walk me through the process, or tell me exactly what the plan was.I had to schedule a second consult and get that clarity myself. I also wasn&#39;t told I was going to be on a liquid diet until I was sent home from the hospital. I had to do some scrambling to make sure I had food I could eat. Not exactly what I want to be focused on just after surgery.
</p>
<p>
Sadly it’s also been my experience having gender related surgeries at Zuckerberg and now UCSF to commonly run into nurses that are pretty insensitive to trans patients. This was no exception. This goes beyond just misgendering. The nurse I got after being taken out of recovery seemed to be totally clueless about how to manage my needs and struggled to even handle my medications. He was super defensive even about answering basic questions. My experience has taught me to just ask for a new nurse if the one you have is making you uncomfortable. A little hard when it’s difficult to talk, but it worked and I had pretty good nurses for the rest of my stay. I stayed just one night and was discharged the next evening.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise I think things have gone smoothly. Pain hasn’t been as bad as I was expecting. Dr. Hoffman’s staff at the hospital were actually all pretty nice and had no problems there. I don’t think the communication issues overall were intentional. I found them particularly hard to navigate because certain things like hyperbole, ambiguity, or especially invalidation to be triggering.
</p>
<p>
20 days in I am also clear of bruising, and the swelling has gone down pretty significantly. Numbness or double vision hasn’t improved. Most of the swelling left is in my jaw / chin, and I notice that one side of my nose also seems a bit buldgy.
</p>
<p>
I am able to message Dr. Hoffman directly and he responds pretty quickly, though sometimes doesn’t fully answer my questions. I have a hard time asking people the same thing again and again. I think there is a small bias as well for him not to trust the judgement of his own patients, or at least me.
</p>
<p>
As far as my own feelings it’s a pretty mixed bag right now. I think it’s hard for me to be objective about my own face. The most immediate thing I can see is that my brow ridge is totally gone and I know I will not miss it! I think I have a hard time feeling good about things, it always seems like I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop. When I look at my face in the mirror I feel underwhelmed at times, and happy about it at others. I think I wanted a more definitive change, but I must also admit there might be no such thing lol.  When I look at pictures with direct comparisons I can appreciate it more. I also know that it will take months for the final results to become apparent, especially for the jaw and chin. I knew it would be a challenge for me to some degree to accept my new face no matter what because that’s how I am lol. I am working on that.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I think it will also take months for me to sort out my actual feelings.
</p>
<p>
Oh yea and also the pain is still quite a bit. I can’t seem to relax at all with the meds, and sometimes it’s hard just to tolerate waiting until the next time I can take them. I still need at least 1 oxy to get to sleep, but otherwise I’ve tapered that out. I am just taking 600mg of Ibuprofen every 6 hours and that seems to mostly work. Ice packs also help in the interim.
</p>
<p>
I also had to get my general doctor to prescribe meds, as Hoffman’s office wanted to taper me even though I was still having too much pain.
</p>
<p>
If you have surgery with Hoffman, I highly advise coordinating care with your personal doctor, and with the gender health clinic in SF if you have access to that. I also advise being proactive and firm with communication, and getting as much clarity as you can around what you want to get out of the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to post this because there wasn’t a lot of useful information on this doctor online, and I thought this might be helpful to someone out there. I might post an update later if there is anything significant to update about. Please feel free to reach out to me through reddit or ask here if you have more questions about Dr. Hoffman.
</p>
<p>
Update ( 5 days later ):
</p>
<p>
After processing my feelings more I think I can say what I feel is some relief about a few of my facial features, especially my brow. It&#39;s not really about being happy or unhappy, that&#39;s not the goal of these types of surgeries in my mind. The goal is to reduce that feeling of dysphoria and that has certainly happened with my face to a degree. I think there is just some anxiety which causes my feelings to flip back and forth because I can still see the profile of my jaw shifting day to day, and it&#39;s unclear how things will settle out. Sometimes I see it and still get that, &#34;ugh&#34; feeling when seeing myself, but at others not so much. I try not to let those feelings though turn into a spiral of negative thoughts. Feelings do what they are gonna do though, so I try to just let them be. I think also my feelings do tend to flip flop a lot in general, and my brain likes to throw reasons at me for why that is. Thank you brain for your interesting... theories.
</p>
<p>
Also wanted to clarify too that I did identify the communication issues at the first consult, and choosing to move forward with this doctor was also accepting that this issue was going to continue. It&#39;s just the landscape of the path I chose. I just wanted to talk about it since the signs are subtle and I could see it catching others off guard. This is definitely not a trauma informed clinic, but I also wouldn&#39;t say it was bad either.

3 months after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I am still having the same double vision I woke up with since I had surgery. It hasn&#39;t really improved much and it&#39;s very challenging to do certain every day things like reading or driving. Today I had my 4th follow up with Dr. Hoffman since surgery, and he seemed pretty discouraged about my vision compared to past visits. He&#39;s already taken the steps to refer me to orthopedic ophthalmology, however the consult for that is over 2 months away. The basic issue is that my right eye seems rotated counter clockwise by about 10 to 15 degrees. It makes everything offset diagonally, and the further something is away from my center of vision, the more offset it is. My peripheral vision is basically useless, and everything looks broken down the middle. Even when my brain is able to make a single image out of something it&#39;s distorted.
</p>
<p>
According to Dr. Hoffman he has only had 1 other patient with persistent double vision and after 4 months it went away on its own. I&#39;m at 3 months now though with no sign of improvement.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise everything is healing up fine. There is still swelling and tightness in areas as well as numbness. There is some asymmetry that I am hoping will resolve as things settle out.  I&#39;m still very mixed on the outcome overall, but there are definitely things I can appreciate, and it is an overall improvement to my appearance.

No worries. So long as you find it helpful.
</p>
<p>
No the issue never went away on its own. I ended up having surgery to help with the issue and it helped a lot, but the range of motion in my damaged eye is limited and I will always have double vision when looking certain directions. I have an excuse to wear glasses now though lol.
</p>
<p>
So the muscle in the eye that allows it to move is what got, &#34;weakened&#34; which I think is a doctor&#39;s way of saying partially severed or completely severed.
</p>
<p>
Now I want to caution that this is an extremely rare complication, and I seem to be Hoffman&#39;s one and only patient out of hundreds who has had this issue.
</p>
<p>
As for outcomes, I have had 3 revisions in total. Mostly to correct issues from the previous surgery. This isn&#39;t too uncommon. Even though I have trouble with seeing myself ( like passing to myself ), I can say that since the very first surgery that I have been misgendered zero times. Absolutely none, and considering how long it&#39;s been since ffs, that&#39;s pretty huge. I&#39;m six feet tall too. One other huge difference is that other random women I don&#39;t know will now just come up and casually talk to me. They read me as cis. I go partner dancing a lot, and I started this habit after surgery. The men I dance with definitely read me as cis, and it&#39;s great.
</p>
<p>
There is a very noticeable difference in how I am treated day to day and I didn&#39;t think it would be so big. It&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t pass at all before, but it was just mostly passing, which means people would misgender me now and then, especially kids. I went from being called mam to miss. People gender correctly always, and even gender me a lot more than before, like instead of just saying hi, it&#39;s hello miss, and stuff like that. I get hit on a lot more too, even more than when I was in my early 20s after I transitioned. I can say at least that the world now views me as female, though I am not certain I have escaped being clocked by other trans people lol.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this helps. Let me know if you have more questions.

And those 3 revisions you had was to correct the damaged eye or were there other complications as well?

This is what im hoping for as well 🥹... ive only been on hrt for about 5 months but i dont really expect many changes with regards to my face... it would be a dream of mine to be able to pass without being clocked by others... im still boymoding and probably will until I get FFS... but from your results you give me so much hope... you look really beautiful 🥰

I think the overall effect is good, certain areas if taken in isolation are very good and I think it’s definitely an improvement for a feminine look.
</p>
<p>
I’m always my biggest critic whatever it’s about so understanding what you’re saying and I’m sure it’s only going to improve.

Thanks! I think these days it&#39;s like well it&#39;s still my face, so I like it for that reason. I liked the old face for that reason, it was just triggering for me at times. I hope this helps.

your face still has lots of healing to do right? Like you don’t know your final face until like 6-12 months?

Just to clarify I was saying I like my face either way because it&#39;s my face. Also yes you are correct it takes many months before things fully settle. I&#39;m not trying to say I am unhappy so far, it&#39;s just my feelings go back and forth a lot as a default. I would likely feel mixed regardless of the outcome. This makes it hard for me to know what that outcome means for me without a bit of time and effort.

Wow! you look great :)
</p>
<p>
You are so courageous!! glad you are recovering well. I have had a consult and tentative date next year with a surgeon in TX  BUT this will be out of network for my insurance and the costs may make me wait another year.
</p>
<p>
I hope to have most of the same procedures as you except the lower jaw and fat grafting.
</p>
<p>
Thank you sooo soo much for sharing your experience and results. I hope you continue to recover quickly. It seems like information like this is so hard to find online. (for me)

Thank you, glad this is useful for you. I am a little sad to hear that this type of info is hard to come by. I haven&#39;t really done too much research on the subject in years. It seems a lot more routine now which seems safe.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like working with insurance is pretty frustrating, but I am glad you are moving forward. I hope it goes well for you!

Hurrah for you!  You accomplished a lot.  Utterly amazing that your swelling didn&#39;t develop a lot, or has gone down an awful lot.  It didn&#39;t hurt that you looked great beforehand, and better now already (!), so all the coming months are gravy.  Too bad about the communication difficulties - that sounds pretty standard.  Great that you could advocate for yourself. Hope you post more, along the way!  Go girl!

You’re still very swollen, so please don’t feel down about your results! This is also due to the lack of communication and patient preparation  you’ve been a victim of. When I had my surgeries the clinic gave me a very complete booklet with everything about what to expect and how to prepare for before and after surgery, including the fact that most patients feel down about their results right after, that’s a completely normal thing to experience.

The swelling does take months to resolve, but I can already see he’s done absolutely beautiful work on you. And I love your new profile!! The result is pretty and so very flattering, but they didn’t remove the essence of ‘you’. I’m just thrilled for you. I hope the double vision and other bothersome things resolve as quickly as possible.
</p>

I know it’s hard when it’s your face that’s involved, but try not to get too obsessed with the healing phase until your final results appear; try getting into other stuff that interests you, how long are you off work for? I know it’s not easy and we’ve been getting a lot of rain in the Bay Area, not great for taking walks in nature and stuff but if you can that really helps. Make sure to keep your face shielded from the sun at all times, SPF50 and a floppy hat and sunglasses. Looking very much forward to seeing your results in a few months!

Thank you for your kind words. I don&#39;t really see myself as a victim of anything. I knew communication was going to be an issue after my first consult and accepted that was as part of going with this doctor. I just had to plan around it.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m unhappy as much as I wouldn&#39;t say I was happy. In my experience these surgeries aren&#39;t about that. It&#39;s more like a kind of relief, and things like my brow line which are obviously gone are a relief. I will never miss that being gone. I try to take the attitude these days that it&#39;s my face so it&#39;s worth liking for that reason alone no matter what. I think there are other aspects of my face which were triggering before that aren&#39;t fully resolved right now, but as you said it takes months especially in areas like the jaw. I can see the profile of my jaw shifting around day to day so at least I can intellectualize that it will take time. Feelings are still gonna feel however they want though lol.
</p>
<p>
As far as time off I&#39;m in a good place. I don&#39;t have any commitments and I&#39;ve got a few more months until I really need to do anything. I do have at least one good floppy hat so I&#39;ll be sure to wear that. It certainly has been pretty rainy. Sounds like you are also from the area.

Thanks! I am actually stunned that this hasn&#39;t cost me a dime. SF has had some form of universal healthcare for some time provided you meet certain requirements. Even so, it&#39;s been so difficult over the years having my trans related needs basically being ignored by healthcare at large and in some cases made worse. That&#39;s only started to change very recently since SF Health Plan has become more trans inclusive. Even within a system that is supposed to support me I&#39;ve had serious issues, but so far cost hasn&#39;t been one of them. I think many insurances in CA are covering FFS now, though most of them make you fight for it. It&#39;s been smooth sailing for me though once the referrals have been made.
</p>
<p>
Granted my previous doctor lied to me for a year and told me this referral was in process and gave me updates about why it was taking so long. Then I found out she never even submitted the paperwork in the first place. Glad I got a new doctor. The accumulation of things like this gives me a lot of anxiety still about dealing with doctors in general.

It&#39;s SF Health Plan. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a company, but I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s scary government health care, oooOOOooooOOO!
