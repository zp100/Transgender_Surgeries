I think an important reframing here might be to try to remind yourself that this is YOUR vagina, not the property of those extremely shallow-sounding men. You don&#39;t owe anyone else a specific depth. You didn&#39;t even talk about how you feel or what you want, just about whether you&#39;re pleasing random men who don&#39;t even seem to be in your life long term. Before having another major surgery with complication risks, I would say take a deep breath and explore yourself and what your vagina means to YOU.

Of course, honestly I&#39;m more shocked these men feel they have any right to say these things. It would be wildly inappropriate for them to criticize a cis woman&#39;s vagina like it was an object built for them, and your vagina is just as deserving of respect. If they want to be with you then it is on the two of you to figure out together what works best for both of you in the bedroom, and that&#39;s true of literally any sexual partnership. The fact that you had surgery once doesn&#39;t mean this is a custom shop where they get to ask for chrome wheels and a sunroof. They have no more right to ask you to surgically lengthen your anatomy than you would to ask them to surgically shorten theirs! (I&#39;d love to see their faces if you suggested that). I guess my point is to take some time to live with your vagina and really feel it as a part of your body, not some separate thing, before making big choices.

Right. The men, rather than OP, are shallow.

Oh lord, I guess I&#39;ll be finding out soon. I&#39;m in a similar situation but I only reach the 2nd dot, despite diligent dilating. Haven&#39;t been back to NYU to request a revision yet, but I was planning on it.
</p>
<p>
I skipped my last appointment because I can&#39;t seem to communicate well with the team at NYU and I hated my experience, aside from the hospital stay. I wasn&#39;t going to go back, but RBL still has such a good reputation I decided to try one more time for the sake of a revision.

I&#39;m not sure.. I consulted with Bowers, but have read not-so-nice things about her post-op care.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m close to the Hanna gender center, so I just requested a consultation today.

I haven’t had sex yet. I am on my third week of recovering. I had a pinal inversion with Tunica I think. I didn’t have a lot of tissue to work with because I was very small. I got to the fourth dot but now I am at the third and I am maintaining the third. I guess my question is… is it really that difficult to have sex when you only reach the third? It’s like 4.5 inches right? I am very interested to know.

Oh OK now I understand better. I am upsizing to the blue one right now. Doing 20 minutes purple and 10 minutes blue. I am able to reach to the third on the blue too. I am only on my third week of recovery after surgery. I can definitely imagine being difficult to have sex when you are on the purple only. Sorry you are going through this but I hope you are able to find a solution sometime soon.

This statement seems to contradict your original post. Asking you to do pelvic floor PT before considering a revision sounds like reasonable and professional (albeit kinda annoying) medical advice.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, you describe being ridiculed and called hysterical which is not professional or right of them. I’m frankly missing too much relevant info about what happened (and their perspective in this) to come to any helpful conclusions here

Oh if you just recently had surgery definitely wait it out. If you know you’re going to get the revision in the future just do with what you can dilation wise until you get accepted for the revision. I heard most successful revision are colovaginoplasty where they use part of your colon and they don’t loose depth just the entrance is tight in the beginning.  I think you should research on the types of revisions so your results are far more favorable
