Did he fully setback your sinus? Kinda looks prominent still, and good type 3s are generally instant flat results as bone does not swell much..

i just had my virtual consult with cardenas this morning. He thinks chin contour by bone shaving method would be enough for my but i love your results with the ostectomy! can i ask, is the incision for chin ostectomy done through the inside of mouth as well or from under chin?
</p>
<p>
I keep coming back to your post because your results are so encouraging for me with my decision on cardenas ðŸ¥°

yes it is done through the mouth as well!
</p>
<p>
as a note i didnt request an ostectomy, rather cardenas said I would need it. He tended to be dead on whenever he felt i needed or didnt need something. not to influence what you decide to do!

i had my consult with him yesterday morning and seems he thinks bone shaving will be sufficiant.. idk i just wanna get the best possible results, so iâ€™ll just say when i have my in person meeting before the surgery that he can feel free tonplay it by ear and once hes in there and can see the bone if an ostectomy would be more helpful than i give him the okay to do and charge me for it haha

Her entire face looks swollen.  Its also possible that she was mostly thick bone there, and not much frontal sinus.  In this case, what is posterior to the forehead is the brain after the bone is shaved away and sinus set back; not really a case of not-removed frontal sinus.  Theres not much FFS surgeons can do in this case.  I think when her swelling goes down, she will pass.

If its thick bone, then shaving the surrounding bone to further flatten and even out her forehead would be no problem. Cardenas foreheads usually always look prominent, thats why I went for FFS in Argentina, same price, but more precise work and CT scans to minimize the need of a possible future revision

It really depends on the existing bone structure.  Some of his patients unfortunately have more projection of the brain and posterior sinus wall, thus a more &#34;boxy&#34; skull in that area.  In this case, after the type 3 is done, only so much can be done, and the key detail is going to be reducing the orbital rims and the sides of the forehead.  I think that enough was taken down for her to pass. However, she will benefit from a rhinoplasty, though.  Her nose makes her forehead seem larger than it is, and I am not saying this to hurt any feelings, thats just how I read her.  There are cis women with noses like this, though, like my mother. Rossi and Di Maggio are both good options for FFS in Latin America.  However, if youre travelling alone, it can be a challenge, as you&#39;ll be alone in recovery.  Some of us are older and this just doesnt work out.  I am going to Dr Cardenas and I specifically asked multiple times to bring my forehead down as much as was done for
<a href="/u/wokouwokou" rel="nofollow">/u/wokouwokou
</a>
and many others.  I am sure he will do this for me.  I am confident in my choice.  I am having a very feminine rhinoplasty done, as well.
