IANAD, but
<em>
I&#39;ve
</em>
never heard of anything like this (especially so long post-op).
</p>
<p>
This is one for your surgeon. It
<em>
may
</em>
be a hernia. We aren&#39;t doctors though. Ask a real one.

Yeah I already have an ultrasound booked to get it checked for a hernia. Figured I would see if anyone else experienced the same thing while I wait for shit to calm down before going to a hospital haha

I had a bilateral orchie which resulted in the cords becoming ‚Äútethered‚Äù (an actual medical term) in the healing process. Meaning the sectioned ends of the cords became attached exterior of the inguinal canals. In my case, the surgeon did not section the cords as high as possible so they would retreat up into the canals during the healing process. Because one of the sectioned ends became swollen, much like a small testicle about the size of a thumbnail and was under constant pressure for being stuck between the base of the penis and the inner thigh, I was in constant pain. I couldn‚Äôt pull things back to tuck (Edit: could not push the ends back up past the inguinal rings, into the canals), and was taking the maximum dosage of Tylenol daily. I ended up finding Dr. Karen E. Boyle who performed a resection and I have been pain free since. I‚Äôm sorry to hear your hurting. I know it hurts like all git-out. Best and ü§ó‚Äôs‚ù£Ô∏è

This might be a thing I have to look into. The way I explained the pain to my parents is that it feels like the ‚Äúcords‚Äù get pulled on when I sneeze or move to fast. Before it only hurt when I sneeze but on Monday it was all day. Today isn‚Äôt as bad as Monday but still it‚Äôs uncomfortable. Like the way I explain the feeling is that when I had testicles, if they were pulled accidentally the ‚Äúcords‚Äù would sent a shooting pain. That‚Äôs how it felt all day on Monday so maybe this is what it is? Anyways thanks so much! I am getting my ultrasound today to figure out what‚Äôs happening!

Went in today and had my ultra sound (that gel was unexpectedly, and pleasantly if I may add, warm) and xrays. Will find out in a few days. Maybe PM me ?

No you misunderstood my reply. I was in fact saying it was good information and I support your view.
