This is a more full account of what happened, the other posts were more emotional this is more just what happened. My dms are Wide open please help me or tell me something that’ll help me be more informed about my options because I have no idea what’s going on and I don’t want to live with a 3 inch vagina for the rest of my life.

I feel you pain at getting lied to throughout recovery. Imho they just want to do the operation as quickly as possible and get rid of you.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you can get back the lost depth somehow but at this point i would be looking for a second opinion.
</p>
<p>
Good luck x

You can get some of depth back via dilation, but it will take time and consistent effort.  Not sure of what method you used, but if depth is critical for you, then you may eventually want to consider a revision with a colon or peritoneal graft.

I get dysphoria during sex without depth, it just feels wrong unless I’m so high I don’t notice the problem. The more I focus on it during the sex the worse it feels so I just have to dissociate. Again. Kinda defeated the point of having the surgery for me.

I had srs with him a week ago and just had my packing and such removed today, but then as I was getting discharged, the person who I assume is the same assistant who you mentioned told me that I&#39;m going to get contacted to schedule an appointment for next Monday, and that I wouldn&#39;t need to dilate until then, which seems like way too long of a wait. Were you told something similar? And if so do you know how much depth you had lost in that first week, if any?

This surgery isn’t something to mess around with and if you get complications like I did you’ll be in for a hell of a bad ride.
</p>
<p>
I suggest you read through all my comments and posts do you can get a full picture of what’s wrong with this office. It’s a lot and it’s hard to see at first. I felt like they were putting a bit of a show on to make everything appear better than it was.
</p>
<p>
Most important thing is that you dilate, o was toke 3 times a day but Dr Bluebond (who’s name I keep misspelling) has her patients dilating 4 times a day, I HIGHLY suggest you do that. And when you hit the back don’t push too much if you feel pain around your butt.
</p>
<p>
had a hematoma on day 7 and had to be rushed into the ER immediately then stayed in the hospital for another week. I was then constipated for 14 days and wasn’t instructed to dilate. The urologist told me this is the longest he’s seen a patient he constipated. Didn’t dilate for the first 14 or so days (thinking back might have been longer) I think scar tissue sets in early when you don’t dilate, im not entirely sure when it sets in the worst but I know it’s before or at the two month mark,
</p>
<p>
The scar tissue shrinks as it develops which can make dilating impossible (what happened to me) and I wasn’t given tools to properly address this so I had to figure it all out myself because they forgot to actually send me to the physical therapist they said they’d refer me to.
</p>
<p>
It was an extremely urgent issue and was just Ignored. Idk how I’m going to live with this.

I’m not sure about your first dilation, I would trust the physical therapist over the surgeon, are you seeing a physical therapist? You NEED to see a Physical therapist for this surgery because it causes pelvic floor trauma.

I had one while I was at the hospital but she mostly just helped me get walking again, she didn&#39;t say anything about dilation.

I wanna track what happens to his patients because I think that’s important data for people to know. mind if I dm you and check in every once and a while? Surgeons usually only go public about successes so that’s mostly what you see when you search

Go for it. I&#39;ve had friends who went to him and had positive results, and all things considered, it&#39;s still too early to call my results &#34;negative&#34; and I&#39;m moreso just a bit nervous if anything, but if my story ends up going similarly to yours then it&#39;s probably for the best to have the info out there, since things will need to get pretty bad on my end before I make much of a public outcry personally.

You need to see one afterwards too otherwise if there’s something wrong with your pelvic floor no one is going to be able to spot it early enough( or possibly even vaginal canal issues, I kinda got the sense that Dr.Keith’s staff and possibly even Dr Keith himself aren’t educated on the recovery process)
