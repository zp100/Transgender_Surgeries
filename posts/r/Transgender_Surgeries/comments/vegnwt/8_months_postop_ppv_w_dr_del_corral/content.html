Looks great. Could you please tell me how good the wetness is and how often you have to dilate after a PPV if it‚Äôs not to intimate for you?
</p>
<p>
I personally think about doing a revision with peritoneum and wanted to know if it‚Äôs worth the additional surgery?

I leak continuously so I have to wear a pad continuously, or at least a liner. It&#39;s a constant drip of slightly viscous orange fluid, I think it&#39;s mostly from granulation tissue weeping. There&#39;s also some mucus like stuff slowly working out, maybe that&#39;s from the peritoneum. I&#39;ve had to dilate every day since I got out, my routine is once a day, 15 minutes on the smaller blue one and 30 minutes on the larger green one. I&#39;ve used the huge orange one a few times but don&#39;t do it often. Dilation sucks, it hurts and it takes time to get it to depth. It&#39;s been getting better though. Skipping dilation for a day or two is a mistake. The few times I&#39;ve done that I&#39;ve really paid for it. Super painful and lots of bleeding, takes days to get back to normal. I&#39;m happy with it though, I had severe genital dysphoria and now thats 100% gone, I&#39;ve never been more comfortable with my body, I actually feel normal for the first time in my life.
