Hello wonderfuls!
</p>
<p>
I’m on Dr. Bowers waiting list for GRS. I have met with her in her San Francisco office and generally liked what I heard. Surgery is slated for early 2023 but prior to COVID they thought they could pull it forward to late 2021. I was originally going to go to Taiwan but to help keep the family happy, I’m going to need to do my surgery in the US. Hey, it’s like the one thing my parents asked for, and I’m going to do my best to make them happy.
</p>
<p>
As I was doing more and more research on here and in other locations I’ve heard a bit of complaining that maybe Dr. Bowers is over rated and/or not what she used to be. But it’s really hard to tell because, frankly, everyone is different and something like GRS or FFS will vary wildly from person to person.
</p>
<p>
Looking for opinions from those who had Dr. Bowers for their GRS, and maybe those who saw her but opted out. What did you love or hate about the process? If you had to do it all over again, would you still pick Dr. Bowers or would you go with someone else?
</p>
<p>
I’m getting ready to do all of the things as we exit COVID lockdown and am hopeful I can sorta get my ducks in a row here. I really appreciate the insight from this community. And and all data very welcome!
</p>

My advise would strongly be to stay away. Regardless of the complication&#39;s I&#39;ve experienced, here&#39;s what I&#39;d underscore...strongly: Does Dr. Bowers have an overall good track record? Yes. Is she incredibly skill and versed in this field? Absolutely. BUT, and here&#39;s the big but, Dr. Bowers will not be there for you if things are divergent or difficult or go wrong. This isn&#39;t just me saying this, this is from so so so many people who&#39;ve stories I&#39;ve heard from. Often, in my case, because of her celebrity status, Dr. Bowers was not in her office or available when I needed her, instead at conferences, at media appearances, on vacation etc. She wasn&#39;t even there for my unpacking and dilation instructions. Because of how many patients she has and how over stretched and taxed her staff is, getting personalized care when you need it, and in the moments you need it most, might not or may not happen. OR things will be lost in the process. I had moments where I was in dire situations and she didn&#39;t respond for days. Largely because of this miscommunication is where I felt mistakes that could have been avoided happened.
</p>
<p>
This celebrity status too carries into her ego. There was a scene in
<em>
I Am Jazz
</em>
in January that made my jaw drop where Dr. Ting told her something like, &#34;Marci, ego doesn&#39;t matter here, the patient is what matters.&#34; That pretty much nutshells every problem I&#39;ve experienced.  It&#39;s why between miscommunication and that ego largely I&#39;ve having my third major surgery on the area in July with a new surgeon, and my sixth procedure total since a year ago. We&#39;re still debating taking her to malpractice court. So what I&#39;d say overall is be aware that in GRS there can and may or will be complications, that&#39;s the nature, and please don&#39;t let that scare you!—could teeny tiny or however huge, what happened for me was very unique—and having a doctor and surgeon who can be there and be able to adapt and facilitate your unique and special circumstances is critical. From what I&#39;ve experienced first hand and what I&#39;ve learned and heard through various accounts, is it seem Dr. Bowers is not able to do so. More than anything, for that I&#39;d say don&#39;t. Hugs and wishing you all the best on this journey!

Of course! And no worries. It&#39;s been on my mind anyways as it&#39;s kinda been a lot of my life for the past year dealing with things, so I figure I can&#39;t change what happened but hopefully I can give back what I&#39;ve learned.

This is super helpful, thank you for being so thorough in your reply and trying to be objective despite your complications.
</p>
<p>
Im just curious, and if love to hear your opinion, what surgeons do better on being there if things go astray and are also technically very good?

You&#39;re welcome! I can only say with whom I&#39;ve decided to have my revision with which is Dr. Whittenberg in SF. It&#39;s really going to depend a lot on what you need and what will work specifically with your body. Everyone has different sized anatomy, structures, elasticities, desires for depth/girth, aesthetics, etc. That&#39;s to say, the biggest thing I&#39;ve learned in all this is there is no one size fits all answer, even though one would be awesome...
</p>
<p>
For me, Dr. Wittenberg has a background in pelvic reconstructive surgery for like almost 20 years prior to her training in GRS so I felt that was a good grounding for what I need to have done. Reading and listening to feedback thus far of her work it seems she&#39;s very open and communicative. Even in the structuring of her clinic and website says a lot in providing both good and not so good results (as happens in any surgeon) and examples of complications, showing she can own up to mistakes. For full GRS she requires multiple weekly post-op visits which demonstrates an intense care and concern. Unlike Dr. Bowers, she&#39;s incredibly open to divergent care and gender identities, truly working to create a personalized solution. Speaking to her in consultation she was level, professional, kind, and considerate and able to listen to what my priorities were in this. This is an alt-account for me, but I&#39;ll probably post an update after that revision, but hopefully (and I seriously mean hopefully) it&#39;s for the better and a final resolution.
</p>
<p>
Hope that might somewhat help!

Wow, this is super helpful.  Again that you for taking the time to spell it out.
</p>
<p>
I personally am the sort of person who is very into asking all sorts of questions, has some healing issues, and will focus on every detail. This aspect of availability for followup and attention to divergent cases is important to me, that’s why I loved your first answer and this followup. I also love is SF so extra relevant, as I am hoping to get GCS done here for the exact reason of being close to my surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your revision, I hope you heal well!! Also hope I see your post!

<p>
I was surprised by how big a deal they made out of Jazz having started HRT so early, and how many complications she&#39;s had since. That&#39;s a non-issue with another surgeon I know of.

My personal opinion is she’s a bit full of herself, but the friends I know that went to her all seem to be happy.
</p>
<p>
That said, based on what a surgeon friend has said, most surgeons are full of themselves.

I thought she was nice, but when I asked her what she thought of another surgeon, she referred to him as an iPhone 3 and herself as an iPhone 11. I was a little taken back.

This is about right. She definitely has some zingers of liners. Referencing future revisions, &#34;Big daddy can take care of that,&#34; definitely took the cake in my experience with her...

I’m not suuuuuuper worried about ego. If it is well earned I have no problems with it. The problem I generally have is someone who has a giant ego but hasn’t put the work/effort in to actually earn it.

There was a recent post here about a patient who have very unfortunate complications. The pics were quite horrifying. I can&#39;t remember who and all the details but the OP said Bowers was refusing to acknowledge the OP&#39;s concerns and need for revision or something of the sort. Better avoid and choose someone else if I were you. It&#39;s not worth the risks with mixed bag surgeons.

If it&#39;s the person I&#39;m thinking of, her original surgery was with Rumer, who is atrociously bad, and then Bowers did her revision.  Sad story but I can&#39;t blame Dr. Bowers for not wanting to deal with the drama either.

Yeah I was thinking about this too. Bowers always looked like she didn’t know what she was doing while on I am Jazz (I know it was a challenging surgery but she almost always had bad news and was a stickler about little things. I don’t like the pictures I’ve seen of before/after from her, they don’t look very aesthetic imo. I personally don’t think she’s that great but to each their own.

Seconding all this. Jazz&#39;s surgery was definitely extra complicated for sure. Seems for whatever reason Dr Bowers struggles a lot with divergent surgeries. I was there the day filmed her friend&#39;s surgery from this most recent season. They definitely left out a lot of her struggles, at least from what I saw personally. We had our post-op same day and her friend was in a wheelchair and looked definitely worse for wear. Hopefully it&#39;s gotten better for her.

Pardon for how I phrased this. Simply speaking to the few times when we crossed paths, she didn&#39;t look well and sounded like she was struggling. In the edit of the episode it seemed instead like everything went perfectly no problems. That&#39;s all I can speak to.

I’m scheduled for July of this year and all my research points to her being one of the best. She has an amazing amount of experience and is well regarded by her professional peers. I like that she herself is trans as well. I’m in California and since she is as well, it seemed like the right choice for me.

so i’m a little over 9 weeks post op from GRS with bowers. head over heels happy with my results so far. my good friend (enby) who sometimes shoots BTS for pornos was like “damn girl you have a beautiful porno pussy” lol
</p>
<p>
she’s pretty responsive, and i ended up doing a 60 day post op visit in person with her cause i’m still in the bay area at my parents due to covid. (i live in nyc)
</p>
<p>
also i’ve healed super quickly, which may just be my own body. i’ve already been able to orgasm from masturbation multiple times, and that’s without full sensation back yet either.

That&#39;s incredible. How many days were you in the hospital? Was the immediate post-op pain/discomfort bad first few days?

i had the surgery on a thursday morning and was checked out by sunday afternoon. honestly, the pain wasn’t nearly as bad as i thought it would be. i was on pain meds the first few days, but i felt good enough to stop taking them by the time i was out of the hospital (fwiw though i have a pretty high pain tolerance)
</p>
<p>
in hindsight what i underestimated was the mental fortitude it took. the first week or so i felt so far away from where i wanted to be and it was pretty discouraging, but once i got the catheter out and begin dilating it became so much easier.
