I believe this post was incorrectly removed by reddit and I have contacted the admins to try to get it back and the user unbanned. There was a flood of false reports on everything the user posted prior to that occurring so it looks like someone had it out for the op.
</p>
<p>
If the OP reads this and wants to get their account back I was told
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If they are trying to appeal the suspension/restriction, they can use the link provided in their suspension message. If they don‚Äôt see a provided link, they can appeal their suspension through
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/appeals" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/appeals
</a>
. They&#39;ll need to be logged in to the account that&#39;s impacted upon submitting the appeal.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is 4 June 2024 and the op is

Edit: Shortly after posting this the post was restored and the OP unbanned. Reddit works in mysterious ways.

Not a layer yet. She need a second opinion with a known trusted Dr. ASAP  and then worry about the money part of it before things are non- repairable.

We&#39;ve all seen this kinda results before but not out of CO.  Philly areas more like.

There is a disappointing lack of photos on reddit showing the healing process. A lawyer is certainly not necessary, as evidenced by the healing
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1d6iskw/pi_vaginoplasty_dr_hyer_denver_health_week_1/">just one week later

I believe so. It needs to heal up. It doesn&#39;t look pretty after you get it, and eventually, when it heals, it looks like how you want it to. A normal pretty vagina.

I listened to some streamers being so like horrified when it happened hearing nurses explain how beautiful it was but then ended up explaining when it healed they felt happy and it did look beautiful. Samantha Lux and Victoria Rose kind of explained their experiences this way.

Ya, wait til it heals. It&#39;ll likely be beautiful like you wanted. It&#39;s just cut open, swollen, and healing.

Thats kind of sad though, because with my surgery it looked normal when i got out, and then i was just healing‚Ä¶ :/ so it this is a normal outcome, people should be aware beforehand

I wasn&#39;t worried about the appearance early in surgery; I know I bruise easily and I trust my body to heal. Reddit is making a very big fuss about this but I think part of it is a lack of photos during the healing process. It looked completely different at the 4 week mark and has continued to heal nicely since.
</p>
<p>
I will be posting more photos and details of recovery as I generate the spoons.

Oh girl I am so sorry. I dated a girl who went with Hyer and had the separation like you&#39;re seeing. I know how you are feeling through what she told me. I&#39;m in Denver if you ever need to talk.  I&#39;ll message you privately. But I&#39;m here to help how I can.

Forgot to add a link to my

.

<p>
I see this got a lot of traction overnight (mostly of the &#34;lawyer up&#34; variety). I will add more photos shortly, but I want to note that I think there is a disappointing lack of people posting pictures of ugly results in the healing process. Things have healed up nicely for me and the results bear little resemblance to the swollen and bruised photos shown here.

There&#39;s something I will never ever understand. How can someone choose a surgeon who started operating SRS very recently and with no EXTENSIVE reviews and before and after photos. SRS is an art, more than a simple surgeon, the doctor has to be an artist. I&#39;m from Europe and I understand now why here people say Americans are born, raised, live and die in the same city, they never travel. In Europe with 17yo we travelled to the farthest country alone already.

The short answer is logistics and insurance coverage. I will likely make a future post explaining in more detail my goals for surgery and why exactly I ended up using Dr. Hyer.

That being said, there is a disappointing lack of photos on reddit showing the healing process, which is part of why I wanted to show these photos. Things look better

Do you know why we never travel??? A drive to another country for you is 30min-1hr a drive to another state even in the smallest states is 3-5 hours and on the most populated states it can take 10-15 hours. Now think about going from New York to San Francisco thats multiple days in a car. Planes are expensive plus many of us dont have the choice to leave our states. For example i have epilepsy and cant drive that means id have to bike or walk literally everywhere. Now if i was in the UK i could walk to another country on a daily basis because i already walk that to worküòÇ
</p>
<p>
But yea i agree SRS is a art form then again all surgery is. Im stuck with Dr. Roth who‚Äôs stats are actually better than Min Jun when scaled to match. Nonetheless its a scary but i will never have the money to go out of state and i literally mean never.
</p>
<p>
My state which is one of the small ones has two national parks, 3 beaches, hundreds-thousands of amazing restaurants, beautiful country sides, a dark-park to see the milky-way, year round events, and ‚Äòaffordable‚Äô housing
</p>
<p>
The negative is that the states government is well indecisively decided its weird and complex to a whole new level.

I&#39;m in NY and have to travel 6 hours just to get to NYC for my surgeon. Europeans forget how big the US is and that we don&#39;t have great public transportation. I gotta drive all the way to Albany to pick up the train to NYC - there are no other cheaper options. I either drive to Montreal and get a flight to NYC, drive to Burlington VT and catch a flight, or get lucky and get one of the daily flights to NYC in Saranac Lake, but then I gotta stay in NYC that night because they only fly once a day.

Hay I did. I trusted a few things first and when it was all said and done I trusted Me to make the right decision.
<br>
First I had trust in the Cleaveland Clinic that they wasn&#39;t just going to hire anyone off the street that said hay I think I can do this.
</p>
<p>
I had my consultation with Dr. Fascelli and he went over everything with me and showed me 10 out come pic&#39;s in his portfolio and asked me if all of these was a successful outcome that I could live with?  I said all but one.  And he said excellent because the one I said was a revision that was left for him to fix.
</p>
<p>
When we was rapping up the consultation he turned to me and said,  &#34;This consultation wasn&#39;t for me to assess you and explain things, it was for you to assess me and my knowledge wasn&#39;t it&#34;? ???
</p>
<p>
Hahaha yes sir it was. Lol You passed my expectations today and I will be happy to let you operate on me.
</p>
<p>
You no what The man exceeded my expectation again.  My fist view 5 days after surgery was bloody bruised and full of stitches and tubes and it exceeded my expectations right then. I will never forget the moment when he put the mirror in my hand and asked if I was ready to look while Beth held the other hand and I said,  YES.  IT took me 2 seconds before I said omg thank you.  That&#39;s all I need to see I bew things was going to be ok.  Here almost 6 weeks later you can&#39;t hardly tell I had a surgery.
</p>
<p>
I trusted in Me to make the final decision and too also give someone new a chance.  When I say new ,I mean on their own.  I asked Doc so how many have you done? What # am I?  He said I will say your between 90-100. I was shocked at that number to be honest,  I no when he hired on and I no he was on west cost in training strictly for vaginaoplasty for over 3yr.
</p>
<p>
I am not disappointed and far from it and will recommend The Cleaveland clinic and Dr. Michael Fascelli to the world.  Sorry for the book. Hug&#39;s Emily ü§ó

To me this looks like it will heal great, but talk to your care team. Don&#39;t let these idiots scare you.

It will heal and end up looking nothing like what it does now. I had surgery with Dr Hyer last year and had a handful of complications. I just had revision surgery with another doctor. I know the stages you are in are incredibly hard. Post-surgery depression is real and dealing with such an intense recovery is hard. Be kind to yourself and hopefully you can be patient enough to wait a few months before you fully judge the results. If you need someone to talk to, please reach out.

Girl I just had mine done April 23 by a fairly new Dr at it that I took a chance on and it totally paid off for me at the Cleaveland clinic.
</p>
<p>
I hate to say but I&#39;m afraid something has went horribly wrong with yours and I would recommend seeing someone else ASAP to let them at least assess the situation and to not let things go beyond disrepair.
<br>
Please don&#39;t take offense too me from what I&#39;ve said.
</p>
<p>
All of us including you have looked at hundreds of out comes and no good from bad to Dr. Rumor and I think you already know you need to have this seen about.  Yes there&#39;s been worse but how much worse you want to get?.
</p>
<p>
My heart goes out to you and I pray üôè  you get things worked out and a successful recovery.  üò•
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very heart broken üíî for you.

There is a disappointing lack of photos on reddit showing the healing process, which is part of why I wanted to show these photos. Things look better
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/1d6iskw/pi_vaginoplasty_dr_hyer_denver_health_week_1/" rel="nofollow">just one week later

. I tend to bruise easily, which is likely part of why this looks so bad.

Stop copy pasting the exact same comment lmao. And I hate to say but I‚Äôm trying to be real with you here, it doesn‚Äôt look much better. There aren‚Äôt a disappointing lack of photos here showing the healing process, it just doesn‚Äôt look like this after a successful surgery in most cases. I‚Äôm saying this because I genuinely think you should get a lawyer.

Look I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve miss spoken about you or anyone else.  I&#39;ve seen thousands of pictures on here and so many good ones that I can&#39;t remember,  but I never forget the not so good one&#39;s.  And I know one when I see it.  I just hope everything goes well for you and I do thank you for sharing your pictures with us.  It helps each one of us in this journey.
</p>
<p>
I can honestly say that I never had a nervous moment before surgery because of everyone sharing there experience both good and bad. Sure I new there was a small chance things could go wrong,  namely when I seen my return flight from Cleveland was on a Boeing Max . Lol I thought great. ü§£ I&#39;m finally getting my dreams come true and ain&#39;t gonna make it home without a bolt malfunction on an airplane.
<br>
That&#39;s honestly what fears I had.
</p>
<p>
I new what to expect out of surgery because of all the brave women who like yourself who posted there journey.  We&#39;re all family in it together.

I wish you all the best.  Hug&#39;s Emily ü§ó

Seeing this and living in Colorado with Colorado Medicaid is so disheartening. I‚Äôve been getting electro for months, and Hyer is the only surgeon my pcp is referring me to (she‚Äôs supposedly the best in our state but is clearly ghetto). I literally can‚Äôt end up like this. So I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do now

From others I&#39;ve seen who have gone with Dr. Hyer, this seems to be how her surgeries go - they&#39;ll look bad for the first week or so, and then clean up quite nicely. Your body is capable of healing a lot of things, and I&#39;m personally quite happy with my results (I am in the process of posting updates of my healing and will eventually catch up to the present).
