Do the scars bother you? It&#39;s the one thing stopping me from getting them (well, and the price tag, LOL).
</p>
<p>
You must be one of the few people in the world who has gotten these procedures.

The scars don&#39;t really bother me! They&#39;re healing pretty quickly and even then I don&#39;t mind them- I imagine they make for an interesting first impression, at the very least.

<strong>
Edit: my after photos are on the left, sorry, I know that&#39;s super unintuitive!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hi all!
</p>
<p>
A lot of people have messaged me after my original post a day after my surgery asking about how my results are doing so I thought I&#39;d make a post sharing where I&#39;m at!
</p>
<p>
Some quick resources: Dr. Eppley has pages about both procedures I had done (which totaled something like $40,000):
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/shoulder-narrowing-widening/">https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/shoulder-narrowing-widening/
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://exploreplasticsurgery.com/the-triple-tissue-removal-technique-in-rib-removal-surgery-for-waistline-reduction/">https://exploreplasticsurgery.com/the-triple-tissue-removal-technique-in-rib-removal-surgery-for-waistline-reduction/
</a>
</p>
<p>
The imgur link from my original post is also down for some reason- I don&#39;t know exactly what I did, there&#39;s probably a reason I flunked computer science :P so I&#39;m posting these as a reddit slideshow. If the captions aren&#39;t visible for some reason, here are the descriptions:
</p>
<p>
1: Selfie pointing out my scars. Hello!
</p>
<p>
2: Body shape in form-fitting clothing
</p>
<p>
3: Comparison photo, June vs now
</p>
<p>
4: Another comparison, June vs now
</p>
<p>
5: Scars on my back, from rib removal
</p>
<p>
6: Scars on my clavicle, from shoulder reduction
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m definitely really happy with the results, even though they might seem subtle since I wasn&#39;t able to recreate the angles of my &#39;before&#39; pictures exactly. It&#39;s really noticeable to me in the mirror still- having a more cinched waist and less defined, boxy shoulders is visible to me whenever I see myself. There&#39;s a sense of relief similar to the feeling I have being post-SRS and not dealing with that whole situation whenever I look down or have the feeling of bumping into something with it- if you couldn&#39;t already tell, I
<em>
despised
</em>
my shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a great way to measure how much width I lost- I live states away, so I can&#39;t have them measured by Dr. Eppley in an in-person followup. As best I can tell, I&#39;ve lost a total of maybe a couple inches (so about a couple centimeters per side- according to him, 1 - 3 centimeters off each side is what he can do depending on the length of the clavicle), which is enough to move me from average male to average female range.
</p>
<p>
My waist, however, is measurable and dropped from about 33 to 29 while maintaining my weight- 4 inches is a substantial amount and when I look at myself it&#39;s changed my shape, so... time to start wearing belts?
</p>
<p>
That being said, I really regret my weight coming into and then after my surgery; I did my consult in February this year when I was 20 pounds lighter. In that time I started progesterone and was newly post-SRS, which I later learned apparently dropped my testosterone to under a cis woman&#39;s normal range, though my doctor didn&#39;t want to touch my HRT regimen. I think both of those things could have contributed, and I imagine my results would look better or more dramatic were I less heavy. So I&#39;m sorry if these photos aren&#39;t helpful because of my weight; I know it&#39;s not a good look and I&#39;m trying my best to eat less and walk more.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I&#39;ll try to answer as best I can!
</p>
<p>
And- if you have any ideas on what surgery to do next, give it to me! Please don&#39;t say BA, my bf doesn&#39;t want me to do that one (&#34;natural girls&#34;, ironically enough)

there is an adult stem cell version of ba that naturally grows out + no maintenance every 10 years + no silicone risks. Japan started doing those a couple decades ago (and are firm, bias believers it&#39;s the ba of the future). Costs about 15k, requires a bit of belly fat for fat transferring, and your guess is as good as any&#39;s when it comes to health with this kind of surgery.

I&#39;m thin as a rail. Do you know

roughly

how much belly fat is needed for this process? My BMI is around 15.2.

You BMI is close to the point where you can&#39;t get elective surgery at all. Not SRS anyway. Same as if if were 30+

I&#39;ve had FFS and everything went perfectly anesthesia-wise. The only issue was unrelated to my weight: my vocal cords got damaged.

Who was the surgeon for that? There&#39;s very few cases of vocal cord damage reported and I&#39;d like to add it to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
Do you know why it happened?

So, idk if it was the surgeon, or the intubation that caused it, but I&#39;m leaning towards the intubation as all that was done to my neck was a tracheal shave.
</p>
<p>
Basically I&#39;m missing the upper part of my vocal range and I can physically no longer scream; it&#39;s just a coarse air sound that comes out.

^SK surgeon I&#39;m guessing is Yeson; he&#39;s super good, obvs everyone knows him for the vocal feminization surgery, but he is also firstly a vocal clinic; when I got my operation done, he was also able to fix my asymmetric vocal chords

You can get physical therapy for this and if it doesn&#39;t help you can also get a revision... Samantha Lux on YouTube talks about her complications with her voice post trach shave. She eventually got the adhesions excised and said she had a huge change in her voice

So, I had the clavicle reduction with Dr Eppley in May.  Experience lines up really well with OP.  The one thing of note, since I didn&#39;t have a rib removal my total cost was $22k. It was all out of pocket.  No insurance would cover it.
</p>
<p>
Overall it was a great choice for me.

How was recovery? Was it difficult to change your shirt? Sorry if that&#39;s a weird question

Recovery was generally not bad.  Limited arm mobility but you adjust quickly.  For the first few weeks I bought some super large button up shirts and wore them until i had more flexiblity.

Probably won&#39;t hear back from you but was that cost for the surgery alone or did it include hospital stay anesthesia etc? Also do you know it here is an age limit on this?

That was total cost minus flights and hotel.

I have no idea if there is an age limit.

Thank you so much for replying. 22k sounds reasonable to me for such a surgery. I&#39;d be self pay too.

I&#39;m lucky enough to have family support when pursuing my trans-related surgeries (which in my mind makes up for the
<em>
other
</em>
half of my family who tried to take me to court to stop my SRS) so this was out-of-pocket.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know of any insurance companies who would cover this- it&#39;s a pretty out there surgery, Dr. Eppley mentioned he&#39;s done the procedure less than a hundred times (though he has taken out more than a hundred ribs, as he was quick to add), so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not even on any company&#39;s radar.

Do you have any comparison photos of your shoulders from behind before/after? And maybe from the side? From what I understand the procedure makes the shoulders roll forward a bit because of the shortened clavicle, so it made me think things might look
<em>
worse
</em>
afterwards from behind as a result.
</p>
<p>
Also, how many/which ribs did you get done?

If you&#39;re talking about my back in the one picture, it&#39;s distorted by my camera and in general is not a great angle for anybody- I was just trying to show what the scars from the rib procedure looked like. It&#39;s hard to take a photo of your back!

Thanks, although I was particularly interested if you had something from behind before also. I wasn&#39;t mentioning something about you specifically, just something that always bothered me about the procedure. Like, if the shoulders roll forward after, won&#39;t they seem broader from behind? And all the results I&#39;ve seen were only from the front.

I don&#39;t have anything like that, I&#39;m sorry- my shoulders don&#39;t feel like they&#39;ve rolled forward or have a lesser field of motion or anything like that to me, I&#39;m not quite sure where the rolling language or these other concerns people talk about come from.
</p>
<p>
Maybe they&#39;ve rolled forward and I haven&#39;t noticed? But I like my body shape from behind when I&#39;m not, yknow, taking a zoomed-in photo of my back!

That&#39;s great that you don&#39;t have a problem like that or range of motion problems. I was worried about those and makes me feel better about potentially getting this.
</p>
<p>
What I meant by rolling is a less extreme version of basically hunching your shoulders forward, kind of like the drawing on the right here
<a href="https://sportydoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03-Shoulder-Roll.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://sportydoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03-Shoulder-Roll.jpg
</a>
. And the opposite would be pulling your shoulders back, bringing your shoulder blades closer together.

That&#39;s good - is it noticeably better than before surgery?

If that rolling you describe happened with my shoulders, I haven&#39;t noticed it- the pain during recovery felt somewhat like a pulling together or forward, but when I regained use of my arms to their full extent that went away. I could imagine a permanent pulling forward if one didn&#39;t stretch their arms after a month of not using them, but I don&#39;t think that rolling matches my experience in a visible way.
</p>
<p>
And yes, I like the shape of my body from behind as well and feel it&#39;s the same degree of difference comparing my body from the front.

anatomically there would have to be at least some rolling/hunching forward as the collar bones are shortened in the procedure and would naturally pull the shoulders in a forward direction to accomplish this

That&#39;s why I asked - I&#39;ve heard from others it does that and it does make sense, but since the only attachment to the skeleton for the arm/shoulder is the clavicle to the sternum, it seems possible it might not.

if they are removing a section of bone from the clavicle how could it NOT pull the shoulders forward? the clavicle is attached to the scapula by ligaments in 2-3 places and if you shorten the clavicle it is going to draw the entire shoulder &#34;assembly&#34; in and forward...there is a good picture here showing the relationship to all of the connections

It wasn&#39;t too bad! You&#39;re progressively able to move your arms higher as the weeks progress and you&#39;ve got a full range of motion by week 4.
</p>
<p>
In terms of pain, I&#39;d say it was less bad than FFS and a million times less painful than SRS recovery- there were some nights where it was hard to sleep for a couple weeks but other than that I was ok.
</p>
<p>
A lot better than a super swollen face or scary-looking SRS results in the first few weeks, which also helps!

That&#39;s so interesting.  My GRS recovery was one of the most painful things I&#39;ve experienced, whilst I had almost no pain with my FFS (though it was still incredibly hard due to all of the swelling and numbness etc)

Congrats on ur surgery!!! Do u feel it has made a considerable difference??? I’m broad shouldered but nothing beyond what is considered “normal” for a cis woman that is my height and weight. I can get self conscious occasionally but I don’t get misgendered or weird stares so it really is what it is. Proportional implants have helped me a great deal.

I haven&#39;t had a certain misgendering for a while before my surgery (e.g. no &#34;sir&#34;s or getting the male spelling of my name, etc.), so I don&#39;t have a before/after measurement like that, but it definitely feels like a big difference to me since I wake up and look at myself in the mirror every day!

It&#39;s too subtle for me to see any real difference in the shoulders. If the price was around 5-6000 I&#39;d consider it, but when it&#39;s more than 20k it&#39;s a hard no.

Hey I love reading about this and ty so much for posting! My only request is that you post a follow-up at assume point so we can see your progress. If you do manage to lose a bit of weight, not that you aren&#39;t already beautiful, it may show the results of these surgeries better.
</p>
<p>
I actually broke my collar bone as a teenager so the way I see it, it&#39;s also a chance to remove this lump where break healed together. It&#39;s always bothered me.

Yes, trust me, my weight is a disappointment to me as well- I probably won&#39;t post a followup just for the purpose of saying &#34;hey, this is my no-longer-huge followup!&#34; but I imagine I&#39;ll post pictures somewhere else in the reddit trans sphere in the future when hopefully I&#39;m a little less gigantic and you&#39;ll be able to see then.

It&#39;s not a disappointment to me. You look beautiful. I&#39;m sure the surgeries have an impact regardless of your weight. My request was only intended to document the results better should that eventuality be the case.
</p>
<p>
Do not be self conscious. You are beautiful and you are the envy of many trans women here!

Out of all the surgeries I sort of want this one the most. How long before you can lift heavy things again with certainty? About paying for the surgeries did you make payments on ot till you were close them make an appointment or what? I dont know what it&#39;s like paying for these surgeries yet so any info you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

I don&#39;t remember how long you&#39;re supposed to wait before lifting, but I don&#39;t have any soreness and I haven&#39;t had any problems moving things at the 3 month mark where I&#39;m at.
</p>
<p>
In terms of payment, it&#39;s due a few weeks before the procedure- there could be a way to pay in installments, but you&#39;d have to consult with their office.

Ok thanks. I just worry about the heavy lifting. My  job is a truck driver and I have to crack the giant trailers up and down and sometimes they are near impossible now so I&#39;m worried i will accidentally break my body on it after this is done for me aha guess. I&#39;ll find out in a decade when I have enough saved up lol

What more would you like to see? I posted a couple pics comparing before/after in everyday clothing, as well as a picture in form-fitting clothing to show my post-op body shape and the scars on my back.
</p>
<p>
I figured that was thorough, am I missing something?

I heard after a shoulder reduction you can&#39;t use your arms for several days while they heal. Did you need someone to like help you eat and such?

It was never that bad- you&#39;re allowed to move your forearms, which is enough to be able to do basic stuff like eating while you&#39;re laying down and recovering anyway (you also have enough of a range of motion to dilate, if that happens to be applicable to anyone reading)

Oh, I think I saw your post before. The issue I have is that nothing about that site looks or seems authentic. Even the images are cropped, they could be different people entirely. Not sure where the thigh gap is coming from either.

Several of them are posing differently in each photo, and a couple appear to have a narrower gap/bigger thighs. I don&#39;t really think they&#39;re fake photos, although they manipulate stuff a bit with the underwear and posing, but if they were fake, I think they should look....better.

No, I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s real - sorry to burst your bubble. The site is tacky, no security certificate, no interviews, endorsements or acknowledgement from any clinical governing body, no academic papers, no follow up, no scans, no mention of aftercare etc...
</p>

It&#39;s all fake and too much is missing/not done properly. It&#39;s completely oversimplified and likely a con.

I already said I don&#39;t think it works well so you&#39;re not &#34;bursting my bubble&#34;, I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that outlandish about the procedure.

Capitalising on desperation is what conmen do. There&#39;s nothing hard about it, it&#39;s incredibly easy to exploit the human condition. That&#39;s why we have laws, ethical codes, accountability and regulatory frameworks.

Do you feel like your shoulders/back are still broad? I don’t know if it’s just me but I can see a noticeable difference in the clavicle area but the shoulders still seem wide, if that makes sense.

The picture of my back isn&#39;t flattering, it&#39;s more to illustrate the incisions on my back. I&#39;m pretty sure the extra wideness comes from the fat on my arms, which leads to that sort of two bumps- shoulder ends, then arm begins- look.

You look incredible congrats. Did you use Starbucks insurance or anything similar to get these procedures covered? Also I’ve heard that clavicle reduction can cause the shoulders to bow inwards. It doesn’t look like that’s the case in your photos, but what do you think?

That&#39;s some pretty amazing results; I&#39;m glad it went so well for you. It sounds like the recovery has been good too reading the comments. This is really great information too, I hadn&#39;t seen too much about shoulders (or rib removal) and actually heard more negatives than positives. It seems like Dr Eppley would be a great place to go for those surgeries.

I haven&#39;t noticed my shoulders being pulled or rolled forward. It&#39;s possible they have slightly or somewhat and I haven&#39;t been able to tell, but I think it&#39;s unnoticeable visually if that&#39;s true.
</p>
<p>
But there&#39;s another comment chain in this thread about the topic- I know there&#39;s a pretty big debate about this amongst trans people talking about this surgery, which I believe is mostly academic since only a handful of people have had this done. They like to talk about the anatomy involved, and that stuff goes over my head.
</p>
<p>
Either way if it&#39;s something on your mind you may wish to read some of the other comments here, it seems people like to talk about the shoulder-rolling thing!
