Here a quick summary of my experiences with Dr. Klotz. Surgeon and Urologist in Weiden(Oberpfalz)
</p>
<p>
Waiting time: about 6-9 months Skill: high in urology surgerys, satisfying in SRS,  Impressions: very nice and charming SRS Style: Standard penile inversion in 2 surgerys (6 months apart)
</p>
<p>
I choose him because he is close to me and has a short waiting time. After my first appointment I trusted him. Also every other physician in my area speaks highly of him. He recommends to look for other surgeons for SRS because he himself only does about 1 SRS per month and knows most trans women have high standards. But not me, that&#39;s another reason I got my SRS with him. I also talked to another trans woman who had surgery with him and she also is pleased.
</p>
<p>
Hospital stay was good. Nurses and physicians were nice and my 16 days there have been without complications.
</p>
<p>
I may show my results to trans people that consider him.

Did you have any difficulties with urinating? I&#39;m two year post op and experienced urinary complications from the surgery.

Im not OP - but I did for the first two weeks, flomax reduces prostate size and bladder muscles to allow for easier urination. Without it I would’ve been hospitalized for sure, now it’s sorted itself out after swelling.

I too was on flomax in the beginning. But peeing now has been completely different ever since my surgery.

My worst fear - probably some of your urethra healed over or something. I hope you get it sorted

Can you explain the two-stage procedure (first and second stage)?

First stage is cutting and moving the tissue to form vaginal canal, shortening urethra, cutting glans into about a quarter of its size and installing it as the clitoris. So my labia is all flabby now(still waiting for stage 2).
</p>
<p>
Stage 2 is forming the labia to the desired look and correcting urethra if it is too long or making urinating messy. Also I was asked if I wanted my clitoris smaller or remain in size.
</p>
<p>
stage 1 was 16 days in hospital. surgery takes about 5 hours, and you can leave if everything heals and you can pee. this is the &#34;big&#34; surgery.
</p>
<p>
stage 2 is about 7 days. It takes place 3-6 months after the first. I can give you more update about it next week when I get there.

What depth and diameter did you get? What kind of dilators do you use?
</p>
<p>
Is this your surgeon? Theodor Klotz.

<p>
yes. this is him.
</p>
<p>
I have
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amielle-Comfort-Dilators-Instructional-Vaginismus/dp/B0045XBSWC" rel="nofollow">these dilators</a>
. they are not very good, but they get the job done for now and they were free. I can go to the third one which is 2cm in diameter and about 10cm long. (.8inch/4inch)
</p>
<p>
I am satisfied with that.
