Very NSFW and the flair is checked!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now almost 4 months post op w/ Dr. BBL and had surgery w/ her on Feb 10th. And you can find all that fun stuff day-by-day
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/sq0lx1/gcs_with_dr_bbl_and_zhao_on_210_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a>
, but this is about the full surgery and recovery photos for those interested.  I&#39;m fully cleared for all activities at this time.  I have never had any complications with healing or dilating and have been using the orange dilator since week 3.  I won&#39;t be posting any further updates than this for photos.  Period.  I will answer any questions people may have in the comments.   But I can&#39;t promise I&#39;ll get to them all.
</p>
<p>
Some basic ones:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Yes, I stayed in NY, and was there for 5 weeks.
</li>
<li>
I came back home on March 15th.
</li>
<li>
It&#39;s not cheap.
</li>
<li>
Best decision of my life.
</li>
<li>
I do self lubricate when suuuuper aroused.  And that&#39;s a very nice bonus.
</li>
<li>
I have a full 7 inches of depth.
</li>
<li>
I have had full clitoral sensation since day 1. Dr. BBL likes to test this each visit as well
</li>
<li>
Hospital stay was 5 days only.
</li>
<li>
As I said I&#39;ll try to answer more specific questions if people have them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I meant to get this posted weeks ago, but time got away from me.

I started w/ Blue for like 3 days.  Then went Blue &gt; Green to size up for another 4-5 days, then green only for a ~1.5 weeks.  Then Green &gt; Orange.  Orange only at the start of week 3.
</p>
<p>
Kevin started w/ Blue while in the hospital w/ me and I got the full 7 then.  He told me to just keep the depth, worry about sizing up the dilator as you go but KEEP THE DEPTH.  So that&#39;s what I did.  I also have had 0 pain since the start for anything.  I was super lucky for that.  I also went on a walk from basically the hospital to Times Square &gt; Central Park Zoo &gt; Rockefeller Center (Nintendo Store) &gt; Back to the hospital on the last weekend there.
</p>
<p>
My Air B&amp;B was less than a block from the hospital and that was super nice.

Without doubt, one of the most thorough documentation of the NYU/RBbL &amp; Zhao experiences Ever &lt;üé§mic drop&gt;.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to your willingness to share the intimate details, my surgery and recovery with this team has been entirely without incident and has me way ahead in the healing curve.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for giving back to this community‚ù£Ô∏è
