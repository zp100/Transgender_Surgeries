I‚Äôm very sorry this happened to you, and it‚Äôs unfortunate. However, hair loss around any sort of brow lift or facelift incision is a known but not entirely uncommon complication. I‚Äôve seen it happen with a lot of different doctors, and I had to happen myself elsewhere. A less expensive alternative to hair transplanting is scalp micro pigmentation, which I have pursued. A skilled  technician tattoos thousands of tiny dots that mimic follicles into the hair free areas and blends them into your natural hair. It‚Äôs surprisingly effective and takes away the stark white appearance. I also had my hairline scar tattooed in my natural flesh tone which made it much less visible when pulling back my hair. To be honest, the most effective approach might be to try and find the money for one round of hair transplants to fill in the scar, and then try and do the micro pigmentation to add the appearance of density after. It would be hard to blame the facility for the hair loss because that does indeed happen in some cases no matter who‚Äôs operating,  though it sounds like they should‚Äôve made it more clear that it was a risk. Good luck!

Trust me, I feel you. Be sure you seek out an expert. It can work surprisingly well at camouflage. Good luck!

Forehead incision can also cause problems. Look at the photos here

Personally, if you have to have a scar I think its better (less worse) in the hairline.

Is it related specifically to brow llift or facelift? Isn&#39;t it related to any procedure with coronal incision?

ANY incision in the scalp can cause hair loss. Any. Google ‚Äúhair loss face lift‚Äù or ‚Äúhair loss brow lift‚Äù and you‚Äôll see a ton. The ‚Äúcoronal incision‚Äù is really just a brow lift incision. Some people lose hair around their sideburns and ears when they have a facelift, some people permanently lose hair around their front hairline when they have a browlift or facial feminization with a scalp advance. Unfortunately, that incision can be traumatic and the tension placed on the wound can just shock the area so much the hair doesn‚Äôt come back. Usually it does, but not always. There‚Äôs also some great examples though of skilled hair transplant specialists that restore hair loss after facelifts or browlifts so the situation is not hopeless. That‚Äôs where I first got the idea to have scalp micro pigmentation was seeing somebody who performed the procedure on bad scarring from hair transplants and that was to hide the scar almost completely.

Don‚Äôt be ‚Äúanxious‚Äù, be well-informed. Panic, anxiety, etc. don‚Äôt make for good surgery choices or happy healing. Most people don‚Äôt permanently lose hair, but it‚Äôs not unheard of. All of these risks are disclosed before surgery and are easily discovered. Luckily there are ways to handle it. I absolutely prefer my scar over my huge forehead I had before. We all hope that we won‚Äôt be the one that has complications, but sadly that isn‚Äôt always the case.

Well said. My incision Finally started to regrow hair after 3 years, even tho I never expected it to, but is coming back in and I will fill in the rest with transplants. Really neat advice about the micro pigmentation, especially natural skin tone on the incision. Thanks

I am so sorry you are feeling this way. I had just the opposite experience. They were consummate professionals. My cranial scar is minor, and my hair covers scar at all times. How long ago was your surgery? How long ago was your revision?

Thankyou so much for your support it means a lot, so I had my original surgery in 2019, I found the result to be really conservative and it raided my hairline quite a lot which has resulted in my having a really large space on my forehead which I contour etc also they didn‚Äôt touch anything else on the sides so I have a more androgynous look more than feminine except on the profile, when I went to my appointment in London, I asked about having hairline lowering as I felt this what I wanted(still feel this way) and the sides of my temples etc, they told me that I had a the top 15% of hairlines etc that would not require any lowering and was a fantastic candidate for their invisible scar technique which would mean no noticeable scars, obviously this appealed to me however looking now I realise being a bit young and naive that they don‚Äôt do any hairline lowering at all, it‚Äôs all just with implants, but I feel they just do a one approach for all technique as I had a friend who went with a different surgeon and her result was actual fantastic although he has a bad rep, but he lowered her hairline, filled temples orbitals and it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù hairline where as mine just feels it looks flat and  that‚Äôs it, my experience in Marbella was fantastic and I can‚Äôt say anything bad about that it‚Äôs just hard as I saved up such a lot of money which took some doing I can assure you for a result that I would trade for the scar I have now, when I went back for the revision a couple of months ago and if you do have to go back bare in mind you will have flight costs, hotel costs, hospital costs, anaesthesia costs, blood test costs which has financially crippled me and caused me so much stress, I have been checking the scar all the time to see it‚Äôs healing but it‚Äôs looking the same as before so I may have to look into micro pigmentation etc, it‚Äôs just hard because my forehead is now looking at eventually costing me over ¬£20k which I just can‚Äôt believe as someone regular just working normal job etc,and I just want to get on with my life without this worry, I can‚Äôt put my hair in a ponytail etc as this would stretch the scar and the scar is such that I can‚Äôt put a headband on it etc as it‚Äôs on the crown, another issue I had was the sun, in the summer it went bright read and began to scab which made the scar become tough and sore and eventually changed its texture to a rough painful line, I tried to put sunscreen on it but then it made it look so so so much worse and then my methods of concealment wouldn‚Äôt stick to it and just became a stick mess :( , I just feel so low my partner has commented on my change in my confidence etc, but it‚Äôs just I feel constantly aware of it and have to check it constantly which after having the issues us trans people have with all the bloody things we have to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù make sure are ok feel paranoid about etc just makes me so fed up with not having a day of from feeling paranoid about some aspect of myself, I wish I had gone with the hairline approach as at least I could cover any scar with makeup, I used to have loooong hair almost touching my butt and this was my security blanket during my transition but after my first op I lost a TON and I mean a TON of hair like nearly 50% the density which meant that when I washed my hair after it was fine and tangly which meant I started to lose more as it just got tangly and hard to manage so I had to completely cut it short so that was pretty hard to, I‚Äôm not hating against facial team I just wish I had known about these issues before as I feel everything I asked about was met with a answer which was yes, no problem, never happens, 1% etc , when I went for my revision the surgeon was very polite etc but he noted how nervous I was and just kept saying how beautiful I was and congratulations you look amazing, but all I could think was I don‚Äôt care about that I just want to pass without looking like I‚Äôve been in some accident or having a huge scar on my head that draws attention etc I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just venting after washing my hair today and feeling like Frankenstein I just felt like letting it all out so please forgive me it‚Äôs just been on my mind so much

I thought I‚Äôd give an update on my experiment this is after a revision I had with FacialTeam I honestly so regret my surgery, I have lost all my confidence and I have started to contemplate taking my life at times, I‚Äôm so embarrassed leaving home, I honestly can‚Äôt believe a surgery I had to relive my gender dysphoria has ended in me feeling worse than before, please contemplate wether this procedure done this way Is right for you before proceeding, I only went with FT because they told me the scar would be invisible impossible to see at my consultation, I am now looking at living like this for the rest of my life, going back to have a revision already cost me money I do not have and I can‚Äôt afford the hair transplant route and to be honest the chance of them surviving in such condition that the scar is isn‚Äôt worth the risk, wish I had seen potential outcomes before I had done this

So sorry to hear this OP. My understanding is that shock hair loss is almost always temporary. According to Deschamps-Bradly it can take up to a year to regrow. Hopefully you&#39;re still in that waiting period which means there is hope! (

Hair loss is part of the risks and it is in the signed consent form so I believe it protects them.

Yes they did mine zigzagging between hair follicles. It&#39;s invisible and the remaining hair is already growing back.

That is basically two small  tape-in (or sew in) hair tracks.  There are a lot of ways to easily fix that cosmetically.

As far as I can tell you&#39;re only a few months out from surgery, so it&#39;s still very early in your recovery and there&#39;s still a lot of time for the scar to heal and hair to grow back. In the meantime you can try topical propecia treatments like minoxidil for regrowth, scalp-concealing products like Toppik, or a topper to cover the scar area. Don&#39;t get hair grafts on the area of the scar until it is fully healed. Also consider that you could have post-operative depression and may benefit from psychological assistance. Anecdotally the 4-5 months after FFS are grueling emotionally and it&#39;s critical that you are getting the help you need right now.

I&#39;m so sorry that happened to you! How long ago was the surgery? Shock hair loss due to surgery is sort of normal and the hair might come back with time. In the meantime, does pulling your hair back in a ponytail help at all? You could also try to give your hair more volume so it mostly covers the scar.

Hello there! You scar seems quite recent. The better advice I would give is to be patient. You can consult in the UK other doctors in order to get different opinions of course. I understand you feel down, but I am sure solutions exist, I do!

How far out from surgery are you? It looks like you might still be healing.
</p>
<p>
My wife had incisions in her hair when she had her hairline moved up, and it took a good 6-8 months for everything to settle down. She grew it all back but it took a bit.

When was your surgery? Your scar still looks new. I have surgery with FacialTeam soon and this just triggers my anxiety like nothing else

So how many surgeries were performed in total? When was the last surgery you had with FacialTeam? What did they give you for scalp healing? Have you tried topical or oral minoxidil for hair regrowth?

I&#39;m going to do the FFS soon, with Facial Team Brazil, but I&#39;m afraid that will happen to me. They will also operate via coronal. In general, I almost never heard reports of scars on the head in people who had surgery on the facial team brazil. But I&#39;ve seen 1 person saying that if one day you need to shave your head, the scar will be there, big and horrible, but with long hair it doesn&#39;t show.

Hello everyone, FT community manager here, so just putting out my affiliation bias first.
</p>
<p>
I also want to thank each and all of you for both your support of Akira and others who have experienced complications, as well as the constructive criticism that will allow Facialteam to learn and grow. An important part of my role is to listen (some may say spy) and identify moments when it is important for Facialteam to give feedback.
</p>
<p>
So, our surgical team&#39;s feedback on the questions raised about hair loss and scars around the coronal incision can be read in this post:
<a href="https://facialteam.eu/blog/forehead-feminization-with-the-coronal-approach-pros-and-cons/">https://facialteam.eu/blog/forehead-feminization-with-the-coronal-approach-pros-and-cons/</a>
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps shed light on the topic.

I did wonder who it was who did my jaw, because it was a hack job imo. I didn&#39;t think to chase them up for info on who it was because it&#39;s too late anyway, but did suspect that it might not have been one of their &#39;front men&#39;.

How long is this after surgery?
</p>
<p>
I had the same thing happen, and while it took some time, it did come back. I went with Deschamps Braly, so this just happens to some of us.
</p>
<p>
One last thought, have you tried Dr Powers hair formula? It might encourage regrow to.

No matter how much money you have you cannot guarantee 100% safety.

However with money it&#39;s easier to deal with the complications

The problem with hairline incision is that then the scarring and hair loss would/could have happened on your hairline at the front of your face
