I&#39;ve seen enough post-srs pics to know when something isn&#39;t right, and something is NOT right...it looks like they just tucked you and sewed it into place?? I&#39;d be beating down that doctors door and seeking legal help for malpractice because what the fuck...

I was gonna say. OP definitely needs to get in contact with another surgeon ASAP and a lawyer. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. The fact that the scrotal tissue and shaft are still very identifiable entirely defeats the purpose of the surgery in the first place. The intent of the surgeon has to have been malicious. When you look at 3D representations of the surgery being done, it&#39;s very complicated, and the tissues are all rearranged. It looks nothing like this. I&#39;m not a medical expert, but there&#39;s no way an actual gender affirming srs the surgeon would do this.

Yes. It&#39;s a sad world that we live in. People like Kamol make boatloads of money butchering women who need help, and he basically can&#39;t be sued for malpractice despite not knowing wtf he is doing.

I agree that it is bad and most likely not just swelling, something is very off, but where do you see the scrotal tissue? The shaft though, especially its base, is way too identifiable to be just swelling

This also stands out to me, having had the surgery and researched it for years.
</p>
<p>
To the OP:I&#39;m so sorry, but this is fixable given the amount of tissue you have to work with. Truly though, I know that right now that&#39;s no solace for what you&#39;re feeling, I wish for all the world i could give you a hug and comfort you until you can get a revision. I don&#39;t know about recourse, but they at minimum should refund your payment in full (just don&#39;t know if you can get damages internationally, that sounds very difficult). There are some great surgeons that excel in revisions listed on the wiki here. Sending love.

Nice. Well said, and I agree with your sentiment. We can clearly see the results of Kamols work here. We should all be as supportive as possible to any patient that faces these kind of unexpected results. It&#39;s a regrettable situation but in terms of getting it redone, it seems like there is plenty to work with. That&#39;s not meant to be funny at all.

I&#39;m so sorry that you are in this situation right now. I&#39;m disagreeing to some of the comments here, I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s just swelling. You can see a whole variety of early post-surgery vulvas on this subreddit which are swollen af and I have never seen something like this before ever. I&#39;m not saying this to upset you or to make things worse, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to brush over the fact that there went something wrong. But I also think it&#39;s pretty much fixable. It&#39;s good that you still have a lot of tissue there. There can be done a lot with it and as soon as the swelling goes down it might look not so bad anymore. At least the buldge will be temporary for sure.

Agree with both, somethings not right and some of these people are strange in their responses and inability to acknowledge the surgeon made a mistake. But once you’re healed OP that will be the hardest part done and revisions for aesthetic + anatomy should be significantly easier on the body. Is your canal okay?

Kamol advertises religiously on reddit and other trans spaces. They are absolutely one of the worst places to go to for surgery.

Kamol or trans places? Because if trans spaces aren&#39;t a good place to go for info on trans surgeries, that&#39;s an awful nightmareish reality.

Kamol. Although even trans spaces have a bunch of untrustworthy things. Your best bet for finding accurate info is to directly talk to people who have had the surgery you&#39;re interested in.

Fake surgeon posts here are generally very obvious.
</p>
<p>
The trans Facebook groups allow surgeons reps to operate. There’s a few surgeons posting here, but advertising like that is not allowed. A number of people have been banned over it.

I think there is a balancing act. There are so many people who no matter what the results actually look like will still think it looks &#39;wrong.&#39; People will literally see whatever they want, so it&#39;s kinda easy to over correct and just accepting of whatever pops up.
</p>
<p>
Body image issues seem to be part of the trans experience even outside of dysporia sadly.

Yeah, this seems like they left a lot of the erectile tissue. A technique that some doctors do to prevent bladder sphincter issues later.
</p>
<p>
I also agree it’s totally fixable with a revision. The swelling takes months to settle.

It looks like the surgery was botched. If I were you, I would seek revision and find a better surgeon with a better understanding of the approach. It is fixable, but I have never seen something like this.

I literally had SRS, with Suporn, and I say she should wait. She may end up needing a cosmetic revision later, but one week is too early to assess for any surgery, especially one as traumatic as SRS .

You can wait 2 years and it&#39;ll still look wrong, because it was very clearly done wrong. In no universe is this okay and I&#39;m baffled that there are people delusional enough to try to claim it&#39;s fine.

The trans community needs to stop lying to each other and by extension stop excusing these butchers. Your suporn pussy never looked like this and you know it.

You can still see the shaft is intact. There&#39;s a bit of loose skin around the base of the shaft you can see that is clearly scrotal skin.

Like. They literally just sewed her dick down it seems. This isn&#39;t swelling.

Rule 1. Be respectful to others, including identity and choices in surgery. Be polite and engage in civil discourse.

I&#39;m gonna disagree with a lot of comments here: it looks like this surgeon phoned in the surgery. This technique is unlike any other I&#39;ve seen, and appears to have questionable results. I would want to wait for swelling to go down before final judgement, but I&#39;d also recommend shopping around for another surgeon to do a revision.

I&#39;m no expert, but I consider myself well educated on this subject and feel like I&#39;ve looked at 3/4 of the transfem surgery results (both good and bad) on reddit for the last 4 years... and I agree with your assessment. This looks all wrong to me, the layout is wrong an and the structure doesn&#39;t make sense. However I disagree with everyone else...don&#39;t wait til the swelling is gone down and everything is healed, start contacting other sugeons about a revision right away, and also if you got this done with your insurance I would personally talk to your case worker (do you have one? If no it&#39;s time to get one) about filing a grievance due to poor results from your surgery.
</p>
<p>
This doesn&#39;t look beyond repair. But go to a surgeon who is known for doing good revisions. Remember your life isn&#39;t over here and this can likely be fixed and look nice eventually. But I&#39;m sorry you are going through this, and don&#39;t beat yourself up for making the decision to go through with it. Disphoria is a powerful motivator and pushes ppl to make hasty decisions.

I agree. I don’t know enough about this method for a full opinion, but nothing seems out of place yet.
</p>
<p>
It’s too early to tell. It looks way different than any early  post op picture I seen, so it seems odd; but often the early pics never look like the later ones.

I&#39;m very sorry this happened to you. From all of my MTF friends who have gone through surgeries, most of them looked a bit crazy for the first few months. One of my friends had to have 4 revisions, but it was much better and easier to have more to correct with than to have too little tissue to work with. I hope your healing process brings you happiness and a body you love 🤍

I’m sorry this happened to you, it looks like he prioritized reducing visible scarring over aesthetics. It should improve once the swelling comes down, and you can then look into getting an anterior commissure revision to remove the excess tissue. Don’t lose hope though! Having too much tissue is generally a much easier fix than having too little. ❤️❤️

It’s hard to hear but I fully agree with your assessment. It does just look like they just pulled it down and stitched it. The folds around it, the top of it. It just looks like a surgically done tuck where they’ve just cut the 🍆to make it look like there’s an opening. I’m sorry this happened to you. I hope you are able to get a resolution. Thank you for sharing, hopefully it stops other people from using their services.

I&#39;m so sorry, sweetheart. I don&#39;t know what to say other than I hope you can get a quality revision and I hope your surgeon never gets another patient ever again, this is inept failure beyond words and I&#39;m so so sorry. You deserve so much better than this shotty work 🫂🫂🫂

The amount of coping and PR spinning these comments are doing is insane y’all must be on the surgeons payroll wtf. So sorry you have had this experience sis, someone needs their medical license revoked asap. Definitely find another surgeon who isn’t a quack and can help you achieve your desired results. Hope all goes well ❤️❤️❤️

I think everyone is clear about the results here. It doesn&#39;t do anyone any good to dog pile the individual. If there&#39;s outrage, it should be directed at the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
When this happens to you, and it does happen. It&#39;s more difficult to process and accept than you can imagine. It&#39;s nothing you just &#34;get over.&#34; people can be kind, while recognizing what the stakes are here.

I went to Theerapong last fall 2022 for Sigmoid colon and aesthetic revisions and basically did nothing aesthetically, nothing just a second mess I got from Theerapong Fk ! I’m smoke’n  angry , I needed to be truly opened up aesthetically to really fix my mess , ended up with soluble external stitches that lasted a month basically - never even was allowed to talk to him let alone talk to the other surgeon doing the Colon harvesting - just a sh#t show for me a 1 st time with Theerapong- he was supposed to be good but not my experience - so I have a second mess from Theerapong aesthetically quite frankly from my original surgery of Kamol’s mess  2019 - Kunaporn wants $15,500 Cad now  doing graphs that might not work post op to fix what Theerapong didn’t do , Jesus these surgeons !! - anyways I’ve been Ghosted by Interplast - and you know I’m not an over complainer I feel and reasonable but nothing was done seriously during the Sigmoid colon which works fine - but aesthetically Theerapong did nothing , what I needed after the colon canal 10 days later was a full open things up like a 1 st time SRS aesthetically done and was never talked about and expected , I expected at least the 2 long scars I’d be now healed almost a year and was shocked he didn’t do a damn thing !! - I’m choked dealing with Thai Surgeons !!

Can people please inbox me with advice on what to do? I&#39;m so overwhelmed and every time I look at the comments I have a major panic attack and dissociative episode. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

I&#39;m thinking I should delete the post as I don&#39;t want to be charged for libel based on this country&#39;s strong laws and the precedents I&#39;ve been told about.

You need to wait. It’s too early to worry about it, and if you do need a revision it’s far to early to do anything.

Kamol is not going to go after you for this post, it would utterly destroy his reputation.

It’s looks like this post is also attracting hate from outside of reddit so you might want to take a break for a while.

Do these posts often attract this attention? Seems so odd that 4chan and incels on twitter care enough to focus on this random shit
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s more the comments leaning toward this being a terrible outcome that cause me stress.
</p>
<p>
No ill will to those that don&#39;t understand, I pray they can achieve inner peace and taper off from caring about others to this extent. There&#39;s no need to kick me whilst I&#39;m down.

I never said I was a woman so you can all cool it with the messages saying I&#39;m a man as you&#39;re just wasting your time preaching that to me haha.

Yes, it’s fairly common, but you shouldn’t see any of it in this sub as it gets removed. Some percentage of people are evil and internet is a cesspool of hate. There’s no understanding it it, just ignore it.

I agree with a lot of commenters— it isn’t just swelling. Sure, it’s playing a factor but you can see around the clitoral hood the end result will still look a little odd. But you’ll probably need a revision. Just imo. you have a lot of tissue left for a great one. Choose wisely sister. Bonnington. Satterwhite. Wittenberg. All great at aesthetic revisions— at least by the results on their websites . Theerapong does great depth work too if you need that. I’m wishing you the best of luck sis.

So sorry you are dissatisfied. It was several years ago, back when I was still questioning, but I did see some of his results that looked like this for the first several months, but as the swelling went down, they ended up looking very good. Hope that happens for you.

I&#39;m so so sorry❤️ if you need someone to vent to you can always dm me. I&#39;m sure the bulge will reduce when the swelling goes down but it won&#39;t fix it. And you might need to make a formal complaint against him because hé botched you.

Ohh my, I&#39;m so sorry for your experience. You definitely should have much nicer results at this point! I would definitely talk with them to find out what your next steps are because that is not what you paid for.
</p>
<p>
On another note, I went to Dr Theerapong for my surgery. He did a great job on me. He also has done revisions from Kamol and totally turned it around into something natural looking. I have seen some before and after photos for these revisions and the difference is incredible. Just an idea for you to look into.

all of his external aesthetics look the same regardless of the internal technique. You may as well just call his aesthetics the pull down penis technique because that’s all he’s doing. He also leaves a fair chunk of erectile tissue behind.

People saying it’s swelling … please stop 🛑  This woman is botched. I hope it’s a fix for her. It look like whomever did this surgery just pulled the penis back and sewed it down. This is not the tea

I think most people that complain about their post-op just haven&#39;t given it enough time to heal...but like....you genuinely should see a lawyer about malpractice. This is the worst result I have ever seen, I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you.

I can help you honey, but you are looking at a major revisionary procedure.  I can visit you tomorrow.  I am an Australuan trained Nursing Care assistant and definitely have limits  on any nursing practice I am allowed here. I run my own post op care business here.

No, your inflammation is going to go down massively, you&#39;re currently seeing the inside of your vulva, on the outside. Check DM&#39;s, I&#39;m being discharged today

if it still looks inflamed in a few months (at least) that&#39;s when considering a revision would be advisable

Ok from this angle idk now, it just looks like they took the inside of your penis out and sewed the penis in it looks like they didn&#39;t even pull it out or cut it out.

No one has ever won against a surgeon anywhere, and even less point trying in Thailand. It’s also far far too early to consider such things.

Thanks for posting OP, but for all the other ladies or guys or nonbinary peeps, for any surgery please do research. It&#39;s normal for there to a few complaints (complications do happen) but if there is a lot be weary. There is a post somewhere here on Reddit that has a lot of links to other post with pictures of results from a lot of surgeons. Post about complaints a d compliments. It toke me 2 years of research to figure out what surgeon to go with. Between travel costs. Insurance and results based off of my situation. Don&#39;t take the decision of surgeons lightly

Hunny…. This isn’t an SRS. This looks like a cheap surgical tuck job done half hazardously. There’s literally no way the doctor isn’t aware of this. A mtf-SRS at the basics consists of an orchiectomy (testiclular amputation/castration, the scrotum is typically recycled), penectomy (penis removal, but typically recycled), vaginoplasty using the penile shaft using it as the vaginal canal reverting it inside after removing the outside skin of the penile shaft (the head redirected &amp; tied off creating a hypersensitive clitoris) &amp; the scrotal skin is used to created the labial layers. The additional (urinary hole) is made/constructed &amp; the urinary tract is redirected to the secondary hole.
</p>
<p>
That’s as much as I can recall from memory.
</p>
<p>
A successful SRS will be unable to appear any different then any other vaginal screening without a gynaecological examination. These days after time, vaginal feeling, hydration/lubrication &amp; clitoral stimulation is highly typically reached with little to no failure.
</p>
<p>

Oh gosh, this is definitely a botched surgery, and I&#39;m so sorry that this happened to you. My bottom surgeon was Chris McClung, and he&#39;s trained as a urologist and based in Ohio. I had a super quick recovery and no complications with a full depth vaginoplasty, and I was already getting back to normal life after two or three weeks. If you&#39;re trying to find someone to fix this, I&#39;d absolutely recommend chatting with him. He also has a really good bedside manner, and he&#39;s literally the only medical provider that I fully trust tbh.

Hello, first thing first, don’t panick. Solutions exist. The inflammation is temporary and the bulge effect will down with times. You need to relax and the trans community will help you, you are not alone. Yes, something is wrong with the surgery, but revision surgery is possible. If you are still in Bangkok, I highly suggest you to contact Dr. Burin in PAI Clinic. He is an expert for revision. He could check you and may help you (but you will need healing time before a second surgery). I did my SRS with him and I know many girls who did a revision with him, successfully. Of course, each case is unique and only a surgeon would be able to give you an exact estimation. You cam chech PAI Clinic cases here on reddit. If you need to talk, I am sure a lot of girls would be pleases to chat and offer you support, I offer you myself. I know SRS is tough, but girl, you are not alone.

I assume this was intended to be zero depth? I am so sorry. I have had GCS 3 years ago and never at any point did mine look like this. Anyone saying wait until swelling is down has no idea of the process. Seek another opinion.

I agree with the above comment. It will definitely improve once swelling goes down. Also, I cannot find this style of SRS on Karol website

I admit it looks very odd.
</p>
<p>
I want to say wait for the swelling to go down, it usually takes a few weeks to a month at best to get a good idea of all is normal. At the same, I never seen this happen before. It looks like straight labia by cutting the penis in half, making an incision, and then folding down to create larger labia out of the the penis. This is odd because usually the labia is formed by graft or using the ballsack. Sorry if this isn’t really the method, this is just my best guess. Just it looks like it’ll heal down into a larger vagina, but usually it doesn’t take this shape till a bit later; so how it turns out after swelling is anyone’s guess.
</p>
<p>
I’d say wait for swelling to go down. I honestly don’t know enough to give a full opinion.

I’m really sorry you’re in this situation and can’t imagine how you are feeling right now. May I ask- Did you ask for full vaginoplasty rather than penile preservation? This to me looks like preservation? I thought kamol was supposed to be regarded as a highly sought after surgeon…again I’m sorry you’re in this position :(

Girl, I think its ok. Don&#39;t be sad, its just 7days its swollen its new. Wait until 3months when the swelling subside then it will be super beautiful, put some ice to make the swelling down and take anti inflammation medicine. Be patient with the result thats not the final result yet.😊

Komal is one of the few surgeons that doesn&#39;t include a free revision, this is because it isn&#39;t needed. The downside to this approach is it looks awful for ages, what you&#39;re seeing in this photo is the inside of the vulva, on the outside. If you&#39;re still in k garden msg me and I&#39;ll try to calm you down ❤️

Get out of here with that garbage excuse. We aren&#39;t stupid, we know exactly what we are looking at. You do everyone a disservice by making these ridiculous claims without any evidence what so ever. If  what you are claiming is true, we be looking at before and after&#39;s of his previous patients  demonstrating otherwise. Make your case. Show us how this evolves into a acceptable result.

You&#39;re 6 days post-op and now you&#39;re an expert in vaginoplasty? Is that what you&#39;re saying? Since you&#39;re using a throwaway account, perhaps you would like to post your own results at 6 days? You are either gaslighting the OP on purpose or you don&#39;t realize that you are doing it. At 6 days post-op, you have no idea what outcome will unfold, for you or anyone else.
</p>
<p>
If I was dealing with the OP&#39;s results, I would be pissed off and the only way that those fears would be mitigated is by someone providing me a timeline of images demonstrating this impressive Kamol morphology from her current &#34;inside-out&#34; vulva result to anything close to her anticipated result. That is not a tall order. We see these from other patients over months and even years.
</p>
<p>
Again, if what you are saying is true, there should be plenty of patient images to prove it.

I can&#39;t explain the complete void of komal patients results, but they either don&#39;t use Reddit or stop. See for yourself, there are tonnes of accounts which talk about &#34;seeing komal in three days&#34; and that&#39;s it. People shout the loudest when unhappy so it could be inferred they&#39;re happy

Not nearly as rude as I should be to people who come here and make wildly baseless claims. This is what you are doing and it&#39;s no different than   the litany of other Kamol apologists when they arrived.
</p>
<p>
If you have a good result and you&#39;re happy with it, more power to you. Maybe you&#39;ll be the one to post a series of images showing us how awesome his results are over time.
</p>
<p>
Right now, I don&#39;t need a picture of a year old result. I want to see a timeline of images showing the recovery and outcome result you are describing.

You&#39;re looking at the inside of a vulva on the outside, it needs a lot of time to reduce. My friend went with suporn, the revision was an awful experience of her life (it&#39;s an awful experience the first time, because the first time you go from unhappy with a penis to a painful recovery, the second time you go from happy to painful recovery) I would say I don&#39;t use Reddit or anything, and weirdly it seems to be the same here. Most people here are recommended by a friend etc

There&#39;s a lot of comments here either saying it&#39;ll be totally fine, or that its an absolute monster disaster and I&#39;m gonna be annoying and &#34;both sides&#34; it and say the answer is probably in the middle. This is an odd result, but it&#39;s probably not the cataclysm it feels like right now at maximum swell. This is the worst it will look.
</p>
<p>
Wait for the swelling to subside, see how it looks, consider a revision with another surgeon in a year&#39;s time.

Girl please, you’re one week post op. You shouldn’t even be looking at it yet. You’re swollen AF which is perfectly normal at this stage. Don’t even think about judging the visual results until at least six months to a year. If you need a cosmetic revision after that it’s not a big deal. You’re gonna be fine.

Encouraging someone to deny reality is not the win you think it is. OP deserves legal compensation and revision for this obvious botch. No amount of swelling should ever look exactly like a folded penis... literally watch any video of the actual surgery in any of its forms and tell me if you see ONE surgeon fold a penis down. I&#39;ll wait.

She’s literally one week post op. Calm the F down. If she wasn’t prepared for it looking like a mess within the first few weeks she shouldn’t have had SRS. Kamol is an experienced SRS surgeon. OP should have been familiar with his procedure and outcomes. Did the doctor somehow forget to tell her that swelling will happen? Or was she just not paying attention 🙄.  Y’all seriously acting like you’ve never heard of post-op swelling before. If you haven’t had SRS you should have zero input on this situation. I’m speaking from literal experience here, having had SRS in Thailand. You cannot judge after a week, period. Any doctor will tell you that. Think it looks like a folded over penis? Wow, you’re so creative. Some days it will look like an eclair, other days a 7-11 hotdog with relish. It really doesn’t matter what you want to compare it to, it’s not going to stay that way. OP should listen to her doctor and not a bunch of mouthtbreathers on Reddit

Literally check my profile. I have multiple AMAs on this very subreddit about my post op results. It&#39;s the only posts I&#39;ve made, you won&#39;t have trouble finding it lol. For the record, my results two years later bare shocking resemblance to what was there a week out. Swelling doesn&#39;t alter the fundamental shape of something to such a degree it looks like what we&#39;re seeing from OP&#39;s experience.

You&#39;re being quite reckless with the blatant hugboxing if you ask me. If I want OP to do anything, it&#39;s to find the strength to accept reality and move on in whatever way that means for her. Telling her she is wrong to feel what she is feeling when it is so clearly valid is not the way and will only serve to make her feel isolated and invalidated. She needs to know its not the end of the world when a surgeon phones your operation in and leaves you broken and bruised. I have been through it and no one deserves to be told to just &#34;listen to their doctor&#34; as if they aren&#39;t extremely capable and well trained individuals, but ultimately still incredibly flawed human beings, even maliciously so at times. Especially when it comes to our community. Do not come at me sideways like I haven&#39;t rolled the dice under the knife a dozen times in my life.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, it&#39;s true, you can&#39;t necessarily judge a result after a week in the vast majority of cases. Majority is the active word here! Healing is not a magic spell that makes a botch suddenly turn out immaculate 12 months down the line.

Uwu so valid. You said it yourself, you can’t tell in the majority of cases what the healed result will look like after a week. Why would the OP, with no apparent infection, wound separation or necrosis or even granulation be an exception? Why would it be “hugboxing” to assume she is among the majority barring any major complications?

If you aren&#39;t being intentionally disingenuous about this, you desperately need to brush up on your human anatomy, and maybe look around at the vast examples of neovaginas fresh out of surgery.

It seems you just have to be right, rational discourse be damned.

Yea I’m sure Dr. Kamol with over 20 years experience performing vaginoplasty in the trans surgery capital of the world just suddenly forgot his anatomy. Maybe you can suggest a refresher course to him. Or find your true calling as an ambulance chasing malpractice lawyer. You do you.

I didn&#39;t question his understanding of anatomy. I question why he works with our community. I very clearly suggested you were the one that needed to brush up. We can go back and forth all day, but I no longer have the desire to argue in good faith with your blind ass. If I had known I&#39;d be duking it out with Dr. Kamol&#39;s strongest warrior I would have just let the downvotes speak for themselves.

Hey, I had SRS with Kamol just over 4 months ago. It looked very swollen after. Yours looks a bit more swollen, but same ballpark. My inner labia/hood are still swollen (giving me brain bug from starship troopers vibes with fewer eyes).
</p>
<p>
However, the swelling has reduced a lot since the first month, and continues to reduce week by week. A couple other women in my cohort seem to be on a similar trajectory, and I have considered the idea that someone else did the outer work. However, I&#39;ll be waiting a full year before I even think about worrying about it. They tell you in the info document, with example pics, that it can be swollen for the first 3 months (I think that&#39;s generous - it seems it can be longer), and that swelling varies a lot from person to person. Some people didn&#39;t get that info doc, so might be worth asking for it if you didn&#39;t. I also asked the dilation nurses about my swelling, and they didn&#39;t seem concerned and said it would go down.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t love how mine looks right now, but the upcycling of sensate and nerve tissue seems to have been beautifully done. For me, a lot of what&#39;s inside the swollen part seems to be nerve tissue (not erectile tissue), and now feels great to touch - I&#39;ve been having nice orgasms since month 2. I only hope the swelling reduces further, but as I say, I&#39;m giving it time. Maybe I&#39;ll feel different in a year if it doesn&#39;t reduce at the same rate.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how many of the people commenting here have had the op or have a realistic understanding of what it can look like with swelling, rather than optimal pics on websites or good examples others have been happier to share on reddit.
</p>
<p>
Not saying that I know more either, just sharing my experience, but please try not to stress yourself out too much. The op is a huge, exhausting shock to the system, and I felt vulnerable and fragile afterwards, and prone to catastrophising. The communication there is pretty terrible, and that only lead to more uncertainty and anxiety. But over time, I got the feeling they know what they&#39;re doing and I got better at distracting myself, and could relax more and more.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still super early days for you, fingers crossed your swelling reduces quickly! 🤗

Something is really off on this sub. Every reasonable non-catastrophizing comment is downvoted into oblivion and attacked with vitriol. Or accused of working for Kamol which is lol. No one thinks it looks good, but the point is it’s not supposed to at one week. It may well not look right after a year, but only time can tell. There’s no sense telling someone in such a vulnerable moment that she’s been botched. It really should go without saying in this sub not to judge results that early.
</p>
<p>
On second thought though it does make sense that various surgeons would have their shills in here. It really wouldn’t cost much for them to hire designated workers to use the only trans surgery sub on Reddit as their battleground.

I don’t see a single one in that gallery that looks like a whole tucked / pulled back penis. The surgeon obviously did something wrong. Never seen a Kamol result look like this. I’m sure she can get a revision though.

It&#39;s only been a week you have to give it more time than that. What kind of surgery or ffs or whatever the soft tissue damage you have to give it a lot more time than a week.

My advice would be to cancel and go to someone else. They botch almost everyone. Seriously, only 3/100 of their patients said they were satisfied. That&#39;s a 97% botch rate.
</p>
<p>
Online reviews are heavily astroturfed. You simply cannot trust them.

She made another post just after this one:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ask_transgender/comments/15smwxe/im_absolutely_freaking_out_7_days_srs_post_op_i/">I&#39;m absolutely freaking out, 7 days SRS post op. I can&#39;t see any other examples that look like this, am I right in being devastated?
</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I know I should&#39;ve heeded the warnings regarding my choice but I was hoping for something at least passable in clothing, but all this pain and money to have a bigger buldge than when I could tuck is killing me. They literally just pulled my dick down and stitched it to me. My life feels terrible right now.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Early days though, and massive swelling, so to early to form an opinion right now. And in choosing a surgeon one review is not enough, but we have a wiki for surgeons results so you don&#39;t need to just look at one or two reviews/photos

If you do look at that make sure you use a browser, not a reddit app. Reddit is buggy and you won&#39;t see much if you use an app.

It might just be swelling. Allow yourself to heal and grow some hair to cover any excess skin before you judge yourself too hard! You can always revise in the future if you need to. 🫶🏻

How does this look really good? Stop hugboxxing. It looks like her whole penis is still there, just stitched tucked back. I’m sure she can get a revision though.

Agreed, a lot of people commenting who haven&#39;t been through it I think. Especially armchair experts telling her things are botched after one week is completely unhelpful and likely to make someone unecessarily anxious at an already stressful time.
