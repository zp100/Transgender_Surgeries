Posting here for subreddit search-ability.
</p>
<p>
I had vocal feminization surgery with Dr. James Thomas in Portland, Oregon in August 2021. He performed his Feminization Laryngoplasty technique. It‚Äôs described in a video he posted publicly on YouTube. He sometimes combines it with a procedure he calls Thyrohyoid Elevation but I did not choose to undergo this. The elevation procedure lifts the larynx up, reducing the space of the vocal tract, which causes a ‚Äúbrightening‚Äù of resonance (associated with feminine voices).
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs his website which is packed full of good info: voicedoctor.net
</p>
<p>
I had a great experience with him and his staff. I‚Äôm very happy with the results as of this point, but I‚Äôm not fully healed for another 6 weeks, and even then the voice can take up to 9 months to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to message me or comment here with questions. I may take a few days to respond as I don‚Äôt check reddit daily.

How extensive was the preop testing (like, did you have to have a laryngoscopy or something?)  and how has your healing been in terms of pain, being laid up, etc? I&#39;ve never referred someone for VFS but I have a patient who is interested and I&#39;m trying to find more about the process to share with her.  You sound lovely, and I hope the rest of your healing goes smoothly!

I had a laryngoscopy.
</p>
<p>
Not too much pain. You can‚Äôt speak for 14 days post-op which is difficult. Otherwise the pain was very limited. I would say it maxed out at a 2/10. Even waking up from surgery I felt totally fine. The next 3 days the swelling was bad but manageable, really annoying more than painful.

Thank you for sharing your experience! I&#39;ll pass it on to my patient. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re recovering well, best wishes! üòÄ

How much was the surgery itself without insurance?
</p>
<p>
You sound significantly more feminine :)

I paid only for lodging and travel. Insurance covered the rest and I‚Äôve yet to see their claim. I don‚Äôt know the out of pocket cost.

Hi I DMed you awhile back. Curious how you are doing? What insurance did you use to cover the surgery? I‚Äôd love some help with getting my surgery cover by insurance. If you can please send me information. Appreciate it.

Omg, thanks so much for posting. I&#39;m waiting for news on my VFS and the change in your voice is exactly the kind of change that I&#39;m looking for so it&#39;s super encouraging.

Thank you for this interesting post. I had the same experience from a tracheal shave, and it apparently not uncommon. Not only did my pitch lower significantly, the overall quality and my ability to alter resonance was hindered. Fatigue came much earlier too (within 1 minute). I think the risks of trachael shaves are just too high for them to be worth it.

I agree, UNLESS :
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you get a trachea shave done by a surgeon who is a specialized laryngologist.
</li>
<li>
They should be very familiar with the vocal fold anatomy.
</li>
<li>
They should not use a submental incision (under the chin), but should place the incision in the crease of your neck right near where the adam&#39;s (eve&#39;s?) apple is located. That way they can actually visualize the cartilage as they shave it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I don&#39;t think any FFS surgeons meet this standard and because of that I&#39;d be wary when choosing a surgeon. The incision should also have scar massage afterwards to prevent the possibility of scar tissue forming an adhesion and preventing the larynx from moving vertically.
