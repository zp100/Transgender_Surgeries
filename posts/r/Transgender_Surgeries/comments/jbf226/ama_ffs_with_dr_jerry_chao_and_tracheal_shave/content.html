I wanted to provide the community with another surgeon that is located in Washington, DC. Pricing is reasonable. (My insurance covered it, but what was billed was less expensive than other quotes I received). I wasn&#39;t provided an estimate unless my insurance denied a pre-authorization. I&#39;m not sure what the cash rate would be. It could be similar, but not positive.
</p>
<h1>
Consultation:
</h1>
<p>
We did our consultation over Zoom where I sent him photos beforehand to his admin assistant. While he didn’t receive/review them before the consultation, he offered his work email address for me to send them to.
</p>
<p>
We went through 4 of his previous patients and Dr. Chao pointed out what in each patient he did and how he recommended to do something similar with me. I think his results all looked natural and feminine. I partially chose him because of his training as a craniomaxillofacial plastic surgeon and also because of how well he listened and helped me arrive at my goals. While he is lesser known to the community (I believe I am the first to post about him on any site I could find), pre-covid I think he said he performed a full FFS surgery once per week or one every other week. He has other duties besides surgery, clinic duties and shares OR with other surgeons, and I didn&#39;t ask him how many partial surgeries or what he defined as full. I believe he started getting into FFS in 2016 or 2017.
</p>
<p>
We then went through my photos and he recommended a feminizing rhinoplasty, which I wasn’t considering, but I’m glad I did after seeing results of his patients and my results which are similar.
</p>
<p>
He also recommended jawline reduction as part of a second stage FFS surgery. I do not plan in getting that personally as I do not think my jaw is very large and it doesn’t give me dysphoria (yet?) and Dr. Chao isn’t pushy. I say yet because I heard dysphoria can focus on new things especially after FFS. I know it has through hormones.
</p>
<p>
I’m also considering a lip lift/cheek augmentation at a later date, but not certain.
</p>
<h1>
Pre-Surgical visits
</h1>
<p>
Dr. Chao orders a CT scan of your face to help determine his plan for FFS. For example at consult, it was planned for Type III forehead reduction, but when he saw the scan, he realized that Type I/II (aka no screws) was acceptable and it was :)). One other office visit is required and he takes pre-surgery photos for his documentation (and maybe insurance?)
</p>
<p>
He also noticed while I was talking that my nose moves. He recommended to sever the depressor septi muscle so that the nose can heal properly.  A potential drawback is that my upper lip which is already long could become longer. I haven’t noticed this and Dr. Chao hasn’t either with his patients. I think Dr. Chao had a very good attention to detail and that impressed me.
</p>
<p>
I had one pre-surgical visit with Dr. Bielamowicz who took a flexible cable-like camera to check out my vocal cord structure. It went smoothly and he was very conversational to get to know me as a person. I believe he has performed around 40-50 tracheal shaves/year for many years.
</p>
<h1>
Insurance
</h1>
<p>
I did submit through CareFirst BlueChoice for insurance approval and I did receive an approved FFS pre-cert for Brow reduction and eyebrow lift, feminizing rhinoplasty, and a tracheal shave from Dr. Bielamowicz.
</p>
<h1>
Date of Surgery
</h1>
<p>
I arrived at GW hospital before 5:30 am, 2 hours before surgery time. We then were taken up around 5:40 to the intake area where nurses asked health questions, prepped me, and eventually doctors and surgical team rolled in, confirmed what they are doing etc. Only complaint is that for the IV drip they put a rather large needle (16 gauge I think) which was definitely larger and more painful than what I’ve had for previous surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I woke up around 4 pm in the hospital room. I could only have clear liquids. So that night I only had apple juice, ginger ale, and water. The nurse had her watch set incorrectly and by the time I was able to ask her for the kitchen menu delicious bone broth, the kitchen was closed. They did not keep my board up to date with when I took my last oxycodone/Tylenol and when I requested a nurse for pain meds it often took them 15-20 minutes to respond and then it took them what felt like another 20 minutes to check my chart and provide drugs. Over all, the attending nurses could’ve been more responsive and friendlier but the overnight nurse Jens was very nice and responsive.
</p>
<p>
I had a blood bottle for my scalp incision. I had a lot of swelling around my eyes, and I couldn’t breathe through my nose. I had a sore throat because of the tube put down my throat. That went away over 5-7 days. I had a raging headache and I could barely see because of the swelling. For this reason, I recommend enlarging the font on your phone pre-surgery and plan for only audio entertainment, podcasts audiobooks etc.
</p>
<p>
They also use staples in the scalp and I was informed by the PA, Sara, after that they do that because staples do less damage to hair follicles than stitches.
</p>
<h1>
Dishcharge/Recovery
</h1>
<p>
I was discharged the next day around 1 pm. I downloaded and my partner loaded all my prescriptions into a MediSafe reminder app, which was very useful because I couldn’t keep track in that state. I was told I could shower and gently wash my hair with conditioner that night but I was too nervous. So I waited until the next day to shower, but I think I had more fallout than necessary because of all the dried blood clumping my hair. I was on a clear liquid diet for an additional 24 hours (48 hours total). Then a soft/puréed food diet until my 1 week follow-up appointment. Dr. Chao took out my stitches for my trach shave and rhinoplasty as well as the nose stents. The nose stents were pretty uncomfortable coming out, but it felt great and I felt I could breathe better than ever before!! At the 2 week mark he took out the staples in my head which was less painful than electrolysis. Most didn’t hurt at all and only some did where there’s a nerve or scabbing. Dr. Chao/Sara took photos at both follow up visits so far.
</p>
<p>
My
<strong>
swelling
</strong>
shifted from my eyes to my cheeks and throat over a period of a few days. I used a foam wedge pillow to elevate my head which I think helped a lot. After about 10 days my swelling was mostly gone and now 3 weeks later I can kinda see some swelling in my eyes and throat a bit. The bruising mostly went away after 2 weeks for me.
</p>
<p>
I was able to use scar cream on my nose incision after 1 week and on my trach shave incision after 2 weeks when the steri strips were peeling off and taken off by Dr. Chao. My neck hair in that area bothered me and he allowed me to gently shave after he took the steri strips off.
</p>
<p>
When they took the staples out, I went home and showered again and was cleared to wash my hair gently with shampoo and conditioner. I removed most of the rest of scabbing that was falling off. However, some of my scalp opened up. Sara informed me it was ok and it literally closed within 3 days.
</p>
<p>
The stitch the scalp together where the push up the skin together so that it takes the surface tension off the incision, which helps with scarring. They told me that patients at their 3 month follow up will have flat incisions (mine was flat within 2 months). It does not impact the eyebrow lift results or make your forehead skin loose.
</p>
<p>
Because of COVID-19, I am fortunate to have been able to work from home. I ended up having enough energy to work 4 hours 7 days after surgery. The following week I had to take 2 half days. Week 3 and on I am back to full time.
</p>
<h1>
Results
</h1>
<p>
My results are really good so far!! My profile with my nose, forehead, and trachea are completely smooth and feminine. My partner said my forehead/nose remind her of anime! I see the resemblance even more to my mom. Severing the depressor septi muscle has had no negative consequences to my knowledge. Removing the stitches from cutting it did hurt however.
</p>
<p>
When I look in the mirror without makeup on, I don’t have nearly as much dysphoria now. Initially I still saw my old face, it was like I was searching for it, but over time it’s been less and less. While I was allowed to, I didn’t wear makeup for a month after because I do not want to create additional stresses on my face.
</p>
<p>
I’m currently around 2.5 months. I had shock hair loss and that stopped shedding around 4-5 weeks. I haven’t noticed any regrowth yet and it’s about a 3/4 to 1 inch band around the incision. It should return to normal and is a common complication of surgery.
</p>
<p>
My tracheal shave scar is still visible and is raised a little. Dr. Bielamowicz said that this is a result of dissolvable sutures inside. I guess he did two types of sutures one that was removed and one more internal to the skin. It is still raised a little at 2.5 months, so I will keep an eye on that.

I actually was looking into this surgeon you said an inch of shock hair loss?! That terrifies me. I would almost rather not.

I don’t think it’s anything the surgeon did wrong. I think it depends on your genetics. My hair fell out over weeks. It wasn’t right after the surgery. It is unpleasant. Even the best well known ones talk about it.  Deschamps-Braly has a brief discussion about it. The hair loss should be temporary and your face is permanent. Not everyone experience it :)

So I read on another thread that someone&#39;s doctor said that this hair loss shock was caused by raised cortisol. I wonder if taking a supplement to lower cortisol after surgery help 🤔

Maybe? Isn’t cortisol stress induced? If so, I probably had/have a lot of it

Yes thats what I&#39;m seeing, but plenty of non expensive supplements have a bunch of extracts or whatever they are saying naturally lower it. I know some of it is marketing, but I&#39;m sure some have reviews. I would want to ask a doctor about it too.

Good luck I hope they work! Surgery itself is stressful plus the political nightmare and covid everyone is experiencing. Not a great time to reduce stress

Do you have a link for Dr. Bielamowicz? What&#39;s his first name? I&#39;d like to add him to the wiki.
