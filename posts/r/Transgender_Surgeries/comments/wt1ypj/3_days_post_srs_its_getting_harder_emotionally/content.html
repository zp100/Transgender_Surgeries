At noon they saw me as my girdle was full of blood. And when they removed it they saw how a stitch had come loose, so they had to put the stitches back on. The stitches did not hurt, but the pressure of the doctor&#39;s fingers did. Unfortunately they put many bandages on me again and a very uncomfortable girdle. I had an anxiety attack and was crying in my mother&#39;s arms. It&#39;s complicated but I know I have to keep going. In the photo I know that the bandages are but they could not remove them for the photos. Now they took off my girdle to put on a more comfortable one, I hope it doesn&#39;t happen like yesterday.

3 days isn’t very long. The road to recovery is a bit much and you’ll worry a lot, but it gets better every day. I’m working on my second year.

It&#39;s hard to see. But from what I can see it looks pretty good. Nice asthetics. I have been looking into this myself. So my days lately have been packed with images of hoo haas. And for a early post op image yours is looking quite nice. I hope everything heals up great and your complications are over. I wish you all the best. And hope your recovery goes well. Take care sis. We look forward to seeing updates from you.
