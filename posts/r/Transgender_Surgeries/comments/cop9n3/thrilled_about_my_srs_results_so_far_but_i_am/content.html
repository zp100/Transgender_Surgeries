Thrilled about my SRS results so far, but I am unsure if the trachea shave with Chettawut was a good idea

He did shave the thing. Yes, there is a scar, but I was warned about it. It is not that big so whatever, I will take it over a prominent Adam&#39;s Apple, and I can now wear chokers comfortably.
</p>
<p>
However, my voice isn&#39;t the same anymore. I can still speak in a significantly more feminine voice than my old god awful &#34;male voice&#34; but I can&#39;t raise my larynx and speak anymore. There is no sound when I do that, and it is not comfortable. I can&#39;t baby talk anymore (as annoying as it might be I loved baby talking my dog), I can&#39;t hum high notes, etc.
</p>
<p>
I was hoping it was temporary, and maybe it is, but I have my doubts. 7 seven weeks seems like enough for my voice to recover.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if training my voice all over again will have any results.

Sadly, talking to Chettawut via email doesn&#39;t help much. Literally everything I have asked so far was responded with a &#34;it is natural during healing&#34;. And I have asked many things.
</p>
<p>
It seems really strange that it would take this long to heal, or rather, even longer. I don&#39;t feel any swelling anymore but perhaps there is something internally preventing me from speaking like before. Who knows.

Does any of this correlate with your symptoms?
</p>
<p>
If I recall correctly
<a href="/u/IamZhea">/u/IamZhea</a>
has found almost all of her students who have had a trachea shave to have also lost some of their upper range.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully you can at least get your larynx raising function back as that&#39;s really important.

More or less, yes. The loss in vocal power and the increase strain (by a lot) are particularly noticeable. When I try to talk the way I did before (in a feminine voice) it comes all broken, weird, not feminine at all, it barely even register as a voice, and I can&#39;t keep it up because it hurts a bit. It feels like the larynx gets stuck on something (which is why I thought it was swelling, but come on, 7 weeks!) and impends me from talking.
</p>
<p>
Here is a silly example of what I could do with my voice:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tliez0iy7zQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tliez0iy7zQ</a>
Now it is impossible :/ I am goofball by nature and I miss making silly Yoshi and other dumb voices.

7 weeks does sound very long, I&#39;m sorry :( I hope it will get better on its own, but if you have insurance it might be worth scheduling an ENT appointment
</p>
<p>
My voice recovered after full FFS including trach shave after a couple weeks, my problem was temporary hoarseness due to intubation

It took me almost three months to recover from mine.   On top of everything else this put me in a dark spot.   Try not to talk, donâ€™t stress your voice, let it heal.  It is horrible and I have been there and I am sorry it happened to you too.

It really is horrible. Aside from missing my feminine voice, which was funny because it clashed so much with my appearance (not so feminine lady in all black with a kinda cute voice), I also miss making silly voice like the Yoshi voice. I hope it comes back...
</p>
<p>
How was your voice during the three months period before the recovery?

Thank you for sharing that. My voice doesn&#39;t sound anything like an old man with a cold, but it still unfortunately not where I worked hard for it to be. I am glad you were able to recover yours, hopefully I will get my reach back as well.

Trachea shave didn&#39;t seem to effect my voice at all, I remember waking up in theatre and speaking to the surgeon without issues.
</p>
<p>
Everyone reacts and recovers differently though.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you could make an appoinment with a speech therapist who specialises in trans therapy and see what they think. Perhaps it might be advantageous to have an endoscopic look at your cords but the speech therapist would advise you if that was appropriate.

Sadly I won&#39;t be finding anyone like that in the country I live in, but thanks for the suggestion. For now what I can do is wait. I have been wondering if voice practicing again at the moment is a good idea, perhaps putting stress on the vocal chords is unwise...

You could do a skype consultation with one, I know some trans competent speech therapists here in Australia will do it. So I&#39;m sure other countries will to.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise try and find someone locally even if they don&#39;t specialise in the trans voice. Although most western countries will have someone whose treated trans patients even if they don&#39;t advertise it. Word of mouth might be a way of tracking them down. Or contact whichever organisation in your country deals with the professional registration of speech therapists, maybe they could help find someone.
</p>
<p>
Seven weeks is a long time, I think. Maybe it&#39;s okay to voice train but I think you need a definitive answer from a professional.

My experience was similar to what another poster here wrote.  Three months for full recovery of my voice from trachea shave.  I did not have a trachea shave with Chettawut though, but rather as part of my FFS with a different surgeon.  It&#39;s been several years since my trachea shave and my voice is perfect.  Give it some more time.  Seven weeks seems like a long time but it&#39;s really not, when it comes to surgical recovery.  Also keep in mind that your body is busy healing multiple areas of your body at once, so it might take longer to heal.

Thanks. I will. It just seems very bizarre because I never read anything about trachea shave affecting the voice unless something went wrong

I don&#39;t know anything about this so I can&#39;t help, but I am confident it will recover and only get better. I know Edenthedoll on YouTube got an actual voice surgery and it took like 6 months to truly start to heal, so I imagine this may be similar.

I also had a trachea shave with Dr Chettawut and experienced vocal range loss. I originally had a trachea shave in 2006 that was insufficient and caused me significant dysphoria, so I decided to have a revision in 2015 despite the risk of voice loss. While my dysphoria over the Adams apple was nearly cured, I did notice that speaking required more effort afterwards, and the quality of my voice sounded a bit rougher. I also had a loss of range and also couldn&#39;t make the high sounds that you describe losing.
</p>
<p>
Ive been working as a teacher for the past four years, and on top of the added strain of speaking normally following my trachea shave revision four years ago, raising my voice to speak in a classroom really destroyed my voice. Now when I spoke, I had significant tremors and breathy voice that was getting so bad I didn&#39;t want to speak at all.
</p>
<p>
I just had voice feminization surgery with Dr Kim at Yeson Voice Clinic in Korea, and he confirmed that I had significant scar tissue from the trachea shave, as well as damage on my vocal cords from strain due to the increased effort to produce sound. He was able to remove the scar tissue and successfully perform the VFS, and so far things are going well. I only had surgery a month ago, and I am just now speaking for the first time (very little), but things are sounding good.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line is that you most likely also have scar tissue, and your voice quality won&#39;t get better with time. You can probably confirm this with an appointment at an otolaryngologist who can do a quick office laryngoscopy to check out the situation.
</p>
<p>
If your voice bothers you enough, I&#39;d suggest checking out VFS. My experience at Yeson was very good.

Thanks. I can&#39;t afford another surgery so I guess I will have to deal with my current voice, and hope it doesn&#39;t get worse. I am not a teacher so I don&#39;t have to speak loudly or scream, but I suppose singing will fuck up my voice with time. Fuck you Chett :/

I hope you continue to heal and everything turns out okay! Maybe with some voice training you can regain some range. Personally, I&#39;m really happy with my result from Dr Chett and was willing to accept the risk of voice loss (but I guess I didn&#39;t expect it to happen). The silver lining is that there are options to fix some of the damage, if you can make it happen at some point in the future. Best of luck!

Yeah, I don&#39;t dislike Chett and for a two months post OP vagina/vulva, I am satisfied with my result. Also, my neck looks fine. Given my complexion I expected a more visible scar, but it is really tiny and my brother who is around me very often only noticed it one month after I got back home.
</p>
<p>
I knew having a raspy voice was a possible complication post-trachea shave, but loss of range was unexpected. Oh well! Thank you!
