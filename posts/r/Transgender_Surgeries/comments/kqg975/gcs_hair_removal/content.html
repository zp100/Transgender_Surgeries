I am coming up on my last two appointments for hair removal for MTF bottom surgery and was wondering if anyone had (and would be willing to share) thoughts/photos/examples of how things looked prior to surgery but after all of the hair removal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had four treatments and while things seen to be going well, there are a couple areas I have a little concern with and wanted to see/hear from others how things were just prior to surgery.  Thanks!

You might want to mark your post NSFW &#39;cause there may be pics of pubic area in responses.  I for one am not posting any pics until the post is marked NFSW &#39;cause I&#39;d hate for someone to be reading this in an unsafe place and running into unexpected contents.
</p>
<p>
Thoughts-wise, you said &#34;four treatments&#34;.  Were they laser or electrolysiis?  And over how long a period?  Hair grows in cycles and at any moment can be &#34;dormant&#34; i.e. the hair follicle is there but there is no hair growing and visible so not removable via laser or electrolysis.  A quick search seems to indicate that pubic hair&#39;s cycle  ranges up to a few weeks, while other types of hair can be dormant for several months.
</p>
<p>
You didn&#39;t say how far off is your GCS.  Me, I&#39;m taking my time and do as much hair removal for as long as I feel necessary before my GCS.  There is no &#34;re-do&#34; for GCS.  I want to keep the variables as few and as small as possible.  My timeline is also probably a little different than some in that I had electrolysis of my pubic areas for several years a long time ago.  My GCS is coming up in August.  I am getting more electrolysis to address very minor regrowth.  By August, I think I&#39;ll be as ready hair-wise as I can ever be.

Thanks and good point.  I&#39;ve marked it as such.  I&#39;m a little less than 4 months out.  The surgeon recommends laser and everyone I&#39;ve spoken with who has gone this route with this surgeon says they have had no issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m probably just being paranoid as you are right, it&#39;s best to get it right the first time.  I&#39;d say the surgical areas are 80-90% cleared so I&#39;m guessing the two additional appointments will help address the remainder.
