I&#39;m in SF, and the hospital where I had surgery yesterday started this week taking non-emergency patients. I&#39;m lucky that my surgery date happened to fall this week, and I was Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s first patient since the shutdown. I believe I was also the first person in the hospital to have non-emergency surgery from the way people talkee, and because the wing was completely empty when I received my hospital bed. I got the room with the best view!
</p>
<p>
I have seen a lot of anxiety over the cancellation and postponement of surgeries here. My experience shows these surgeries will happen, and at least in SF they are starting to happen again.
</p>
<p>
While I was in the preop area, the nurses were talking through a schedule which also included other surgeons whose names I recognized from surgeries my friends have had. San Francisco&#39;s success in bending the curve has allowed these surgeries to start again, and, as I learned from casual conversation here, some surgeons here are considering doing more surgeries per week to help accommodate those whose surgeries were postponed.
</p>
<p>
I personally think trans surgeries are ideal for restarting elective procedures, because most of us are in good physical health, and unlike for many surgeries, trans people are usually happy when they wake up. It was clear that a lot of the staff had been furloughed, and starting with a patient who is excited about surgery makes coming back to work easier.
</p>
<p>
As for myself, I&#39;ve been enjoying the quiet and great views from my room of the city and the Golden Gate bridge. Pain is far less than I expected: the only things that are causing mild pain are the catheter and my back. My abdomen is really tight as well, like I did 1000 situps yesterday. Dr. Wittenberg showed me a picture of my vagina immediately postop, and it looked very good. The packing was soaked in lidocaine so I can&#39;t feel it, and I haven&#39;t taken a peek yet. I&#39;m a little afraid of the swelling, as I&#39;ve seen postop vagina shortly after surgery before.
</p>
<p>
I had to quarantine before surgery and take 2 Coronavirus tests. The hospital&#39;s protocols changed while I was quarantined to testing at the end of isolation rather than before, and that necessitated the second test. There were a lot of changes in the weeks leading up to surgery, and I ended up spending a lot of time on the phone. Some postop supplies were hard to find, so I&#39;d recommend preparing early if you have a surgical date soon. I&#39;m not allowed visitors at the hospital or at my postop visits.
</p>

Feel free to ask questions in the comments if I missed something.

Lol, I was thinking before surgery that I should get my ventilator tube size tattooed on my neck so I don&#39;t have to keep reminding the anesthesiologist.

Congrats! Also, thank you for talking about the location too. I have surgery in san fran at the end of the month and have been dreading it will get canceled again. This gives me a little more reassurance.

Yes, that&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve posted about it. For months all we&#39;ve been hearing is how our surgeries are getting cancelled; I felt it was important to let others know that surgeries are restarting, at least in the Bay Area. It&#39;s easy to fall into despair when all you hear is surgeries are being cancelled (I did myself for a while), and knowing they are already starting helps keep all our spirits up as we wait out this pandemic.

Yes, at St. Francis. And yes, they&#39;re banning all outside visitors, though a doctor who works here and is trans dropped by a couple of times to visit.

Yes. She checked in with me after I woke up, and they told me she makes an early visit each day she has a surgery. She didn&#39;t have any surgeries today, however, so I had a visit from the doctor who assisted.

Early stages for me, and I&#39;ve only seen my pussy in an OR photo, but I think I will be very happy with the results. I&#39;m also amazed that so far the pain is easy to manage. I switched to Tylenol only this morning, and I&#39;m not feeling a lot of pain.

After getting the lobster tail off, I&#39;ve been getting a lot of swelling if I don&#39;t lie down, so I&#39;ve been mostly keeping to bed. I&#39;ve been enjoying dilating much more than I expected and not finding it to be the chore that my post-op friends said it would be.

Congrats on the surgery! I’m also having surgery (FFS from deschamps-braly) at St Francis next month and was wondering — were the covid tests ordered by the hospital or the doctor, and how far out from the procedure? Making sure I keep myself and others safe :)

The COVID tests were a hospital requirement,  which they were figuring out as I was preparing. Their current protocol is that you have to have a negative test taken within 72 hours of surgery. They may have set up testing by now, but they weren&#39;t ready and I had to get my PCP to order testing. I also was asked to isolate 12 days before. Requirements were changing almost every day the week before surgery, but hopefully by next month they&#39;ll have worked everything out.

The tip is dry, and it goes into a part of the nose, beyond the turbinates, that doesn&#39;t really come in contact with anything. Water getting up to the nose there is really uncomfortable, and this is even more because it&#39;s harder than most things in a nose and dry.

I would say the tests were slightly painful but more uncomfortable when the swab was in. Afterwards I had a dry throat feeling, which was uncomfortable, too, but the test was bearable.

Yes, I&#39;m so glad this came, and I still can&#39;t fully believe it happened.
</p>
<p>
The nice thing about being the first was that the ward was very quiet yesterday. Many  patients arrived today, and it went back to the normal hospital environment. Still it felt really healing to sit in silence on that first day.

I&#39;m sorry to hear that! Hopefully they will restart soon and fit you in quickly. Wittenberg had a couple backup dates in June in case my surgery hadn&#39;t gone ahead, and hopefully Kaiser has some extra capacity once they restart. Most surgeons I know who do these surgeries sound committed to taking on a little extra work until they can accommodate people who&#39;ve lost their dates.

Congratulations!  I’m scheduled for July with Dr. W.
</p>
<p>
Do you find the bolster to be quite uncomfortable?  I’ve heard that can be the most uncomfortable part at first for many.
</p>
<p>
What supplies were difficult to source?  I’m just beginning to start looking for things, so it would be good to know what things I might need more time to find.
</p>
<p>
I may have more questions as I think about it, and please keep us updated as things progress! Glad things are going well so far!

Thank you! That bolster was really uncomfortable, especially for the last few days when it hardened. Also, I became really tired of not being able to close my legs for a week.
</p>
<p>
As for supplies, I found suitable lube really difficult to get, as well as gauze. I also was given a few hours&#39; notice for needing to quarantine before surgery, because the hospital was still creating its rules. You probably won&#39;t have the problems I did if you prepare early, but I&#39;d recommend trying to get everything you need a week before the preop in case you are asked to quarantine.

I looked through this thread and your post history, but could find out: is this PI or PPT?

I don&#39;t really understand what you&#39;re getting at. A heart transplant is an emergency surgery that wasn&#39;t restricted by shelter in place, and my surgeon certainly wouldn&#39;t have the expertise to do one.
</p>
<p>
Further, this hospital even before COVID had spare capacity, and SF&#39;s successful effort at bending the curve allowed me and others to get our regularly scheduled surgeries. We weren&#39;t taking OR time from anyone; it was already scheduled.
</p>
<p>
Further, trans people have to be healthy to get these surgeries, and they are generally happy after, so we&#39;re relatively easy patients to care for when nurses ease off their furloughs. I was the first patient they saw after coming off furlough, and they were happy to be back at work. I asked my nurses whether I was a burden, and one of them said I was a &#34;breath of fresh air&#34; because I was kind and polite to them. I lost a friend who was a nurse a month ago because she couldn&#39;t take the stress of the pandemic; easy patients like me help relieve some of the stress of a very demanding job.
</p>
<p>
The US also has a medical system that is very tied to capitalism. Hospitals lose money on their emergency department, which is why restarting scheduled surgeries when it is safe helps them stay in business. There were fears that hospitals would be overwhelmed by the pandemic, but the containment in SF was successful, and that left space to fill with patients who could help keep the hospital in business. The US isn&#39;t (yet) a libertarian hellscape where health care is rationed because medical care is an item of scarcity.
</p>
<p>
I hope your mother is well and that she doesn&#39;t know how you waste your time on the internet trolling people. And speaking of hearts, I encourage you to grow one.

When you see posts like this check their post history. It’s not worth replying to them and only encourages them to keep doing it. I banned them.
