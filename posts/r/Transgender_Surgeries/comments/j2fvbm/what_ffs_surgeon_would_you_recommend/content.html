Is Dr. Harrison Lee a good FFS surgeon? People have recommended him to me. Who would you recommend?

Depends on what you like and what you need. Personally I prefer more natural so if I was in the US, I&#39;d say Toby Mayer and Bryan Rolfes. DB is also good  for natural or subtle results.

Does Mayer do anything better than the rest? Never heard him mentioned specifically for nose or jaw work, but have heard good things. Is his work more conservative?

His results are just as good. I&#39;ve seen some really beautiful work from him. I think Mayer doesn&#39;t shove everyone in one category like most FFS surgeons today. I feel most FFS surgeons go for the extreme and the results end up looking weird and not great. But most transwomen want extreme. He doesn&#39;t touch the jaw but only the chin which makes sense. The majority of transwomen only need chin except if your jaw is literally square. He doesn&#39;t advertise much and his patients tend to just move on with life after surgery. They&#39;re not very vocal. I remember Inglefield is not keen on jaw work either as it can go wrong and very wrong in the hands of the wrong surgeon like mine and I went to a self-proclaimed world renowned maxillofacial who&#39;s simply a butcher in reality.

Imo mayer is not a good choice. He doesn&#39;t do type 3 forehead and many of his techniques are very old school, including the &#34;flap&#34; technique over hair transplants which is super barbaric. Also he does advertise quite a bit. Most people are aware of his best patient outcome as he constantly advertises her specifically.

I think it&#39;s a case by case basis. Most transwomen may benefit from aggressive work but for me personally a type 3 would destroy my forehead. He also doesn&#39;t have botched reviews or deaths so he is good in my books.

What do you mean with flap?
</p>
<p>
If you are talking about fut transplant that&#39;s not barbaric. It&#39;s a good choice when you don&#39;t want to shave your hair pre surgery. I had it and my scar is not visible even if I decided to get a pixie cut

No, that&#39;s not what I mean. Flap surgery is something that was generally performed over 30 years ago but he still pushes it like its the most innovative thing. In it, they cut a large section of hair bearing area off the side of your head but keep a small part of the skin still intact and then flip it over to be on top of the scalp.

A friend of mine who also went to him once said “he is an artist” when it comes to his surgery.   During a consultation he will be able to see what needs to be done, I asked about work on my jaw and he said no, referencing lots of women with jaws like mine.

He is an artist. Produces natural results with consistency in a way I have not see with other surgeons. That is why I chose him, I wanted natural.

Jumaily, Peter Raphael, Harrison Lee are prob the three best currently in the US I’d go with Jumaily though I like the work I’ve seen from him and he is well practiced in revision work if any issues need to be fixed.

I’m in a Facebook group with about 500 other girls where essentially being fish and perfect is the general aesthetic for the group. that’s the general consensus of the groups who to go to to get the fishiest look. From what Ive seen of their work I’d say they are the more renowned surgeons for ffs in America. I’ve talked to and are friends with girls that have had work with Peter Raphael, Harrison Lee and Jumaily. Jumaily does amazing nose jobs and he’s also well practiced in type 3 like Keo and Madirossian. Harrison Lee is great but he doesn’t care which is the issue; ive had personal experience with him and share similar experiences with other girls that have worked with him. His front desk staff is truly atrocious. I’ve seen Peter Raphaels work and it’s very good! Also, Doctor Rodman is great and does really fish work like transforming but the consensus has been her hairlines are not tea. I’ve seen them and she is all over the map on hairlines. Keo and Madirrosen are great surgeons as well, just really exspensive. It really just depends on the look you want, how much you are will to spend, and are you using insurance.

Try this when evaluating any surgeon:
<a href="http://www.certificationmatters.org" rel="nofollow">www.certificationmatters.org
</a>
</p>
<p>
Look them up to see if they are (for real)  board certified in Plastic Surgery.
</p>
<p>
You will find a lot of surgeons that claim in their social media or on their web sites to be &#34;board certified&#34; and have something on their web site that claims  &#34;Dr. Smith is board certified...&#34; If they REALLY ARE board certified in Plastic Surgery - -  then they will show up in the database of the American Board of Medical Specialties - -  ie,
<a href="http://www.certificationmatters" rel="nofollow">www.certificationmatters
</a>
. org.  Keep in mind - -  there are a LOT of doctors who have decided they want to get into the elective / cosmetic surgery for the money.
<br>
As a result they have created a lot of phony &#34;membership associations&#34;  with words in the names like   &#34;Plastic&#34;   &#34;Surgery&#34;   &#34;Facial&#34;  .  None of those are legitimate medical specialty boards that require extensive written tests, in person review of randomly selected series of patient charts by a panel of genuine experts, and an oral exam on those cases.
</p>
<p>
There are more outright false or deceiving misrepresentations about genuine training and real experience in pertinent areas of surgery by these non-board certified surgeons than you can find at a random used car dealership.
</p>
<p>
Some are certified in areas unrelated to Plastic Surgery, but then, only a rare exception.
</p>
<p>
When I just looked them up (
<a href="http://www.certificationmatters.org" rel="nofollow">www.certificationmatters.org
</a>
) for the following FFS surgeons who claim to be some kind of plastic surgeon, and check to see if they were, IN FACT, board certified in Plastic Surgery - -  this is what I found:
</p>
<p>
Jumaily - -  NO.
</p>
<p>
Rodman - - NO.
</p>
<p>
Raphaels (Plano Texas)  YES .
</p>
<p>
Spiegel - -  NO
</p>
<p>
Trust - - but VERIFY.    Go try this exercise, yourself.
<br>
Oh! ... and none of these doctors are fellowship trained in craniofacial surgery.

Same lmao. The only surgeon you listed as yes (Raphael) doesn&#39;t even do Type 3 Forehead work nor does he do jaw reduction surgery.  It&#39;s like saying Facial Team who are amazing at doing FFS isn&#39;t qualified because they are maxillofacial surgeons.  Smh get outta here lol. The proof is in the pudding. Demand to see the surgeons work and before and afters

If you had ever worked the O.R. as a scrub nurse for a surgeon who was not properly trained - -  and then worked the O.R. for one that is properly trained and board certified in the area in which they were practicing surgery - -  I rather doubt you would be anywhere nearly as dismissive and ready to LYAO about this subject.   One can ignore that issue - - but in my experience,  watching results here and other places, a girl does that at some considerable increased risk of a bad, poor, or marginal outcome aesthetically - - and a real risk of more serious long term complications, even if the immediate superficial result is acceptable.

Jumaily, Keo and madirossen are all Spiegel’s underlings and are all great choices. Keo has a 12+ month long waitlist pre-Covid and does require a 5k deposit in every case before scheduling. I consulted with him in the past. He does good work though. The majority of the doctors I list work with insurance by the way. I’m probably going to Jumaily for my revision work.

No Id avoid Spiegel and Dr Zukowski. His students are tea though. Keo was like 60k he’s up there but that was with my insurance so he might be less out of pocket. Deff more then FacialTeam. FacialTeam is great for outside US though I think you can stay inside the US for around the same. I think most every doctor aside from Keo and Lee offer a free consult

Wow, I’m sorry to hear that.  I know of several other girls that all got good results.  I’m thinking with all of the doctors, they have bad outcomes on occasion.  SRS really scares me b/c I have seen some dreadful results and even know of one older woman who died.  I wish we had better statistics on docs outcomes, so we know what chances we are taking.

<p>
So why would anyone expect any one of the residents who spent a short time doing a handful of FFS patients with Spiegel (who has performed 10x as many of those procedures as any one of his residents now in practice has done) to be better choices than the person who supposedly trained them to do those FFS procedures ?   You appear to be stating that Spiegel, who trained them, was not very good, but the students he trained are all better than their instructor?  Can you explain how that is likely to be true and the logic behind that thought process ?

Spiegel doesn’t do the same work as his students, he’s old fashioned and been known to let students in training work on patients in operating. He does very “natural results” which most people have complained about looking identical to when they left. His students train with multiple surgeons aside from just Spiegel, they are younger and more specialized with newer methods. Spiegel is getting older and just doesn’t put out the same results. There is a difference between passing and looking pretty if you want to pass then by all means go to Speigel if you want to look fish go to a newer doctor.

Who trained Spiegel ?
<br>
Why would you expect the young guys, with less experience and less training - - to be better at these procedures than the person with more experience and more training who taught them how to do the FFS work ?

BTW,  how OLD is Dr. Spiegel ?    How OLD is too OLD ?
