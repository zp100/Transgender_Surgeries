Here&#39;s a link to the original post when I had the first pelvicplasty surgery in May:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/uznza6/i_had_a_pelvic_plasty_with_dr_you_gun_won_at/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/uznza6/i_had_a_pelvic_plasty_with_dr_you_gun_won_at/
</a>
</p>
<p>
Since then, and after having had to deal with my right hip wound leaking silicon gel from a ruptured pack, I returned to Seoul where the team at Yonsei Baro Chuk Hospital took good care of me. Rather than just remove and replace the failed silicon pack, Dr Won took the opportunity to perform a full revision in order to achieve more curvature. The 35mm implants were removed and replaced by 40mm ones. He has also refined the technique for separating the silicon packs from the titanium implants in order to try to reduce the chances of a pack being ruptured.
</p>
<p>
Recovery was significantly easier this time. I was able to slowly walk again around the hospital within a matter of days after surgery. After a week and a half I was able to walk fair distances (~5km). Now, just over a month later, I&#39;m hiking mountains :)
</p>
<p>
The revision was performed at no additional cost, although I did have to pay for air travel and hotel expenses.
</p>
<p>
There does seem to be a nerve issue with my left hip. Stretching my leg out or twisting it can sometimes cause sharp pain. I&#39;m hopeful that this will ease over time, like similar nerve-related pain I&#39;ve experienced elsewhere in the past.
</p>
<p>
With my new hips and enhanced curves I have the confidence to wear a wider range of clothing including stretchy skirts as pictured. Overall, so far, I&#39;m extremely happy with the revision results.

I believe they had larger when I was looking at them in the office. I don’t think they’ve actually fit anything larger though. At time of my 2nd revision I believe I was still the largest westerner they had operated on. Dr Won initially wanted to put the 40mm implants in on my first surgery but couldn’t due to lack of space. It wasn’t until the revision when my body had already had some time to adapt that the 40’s became viable.
</p>
<p>
Most of the pics on the website are from cis women probably half my size. I think there is at least one trans woman on there but she was smaller than me. I’m 176cm and 71kg btw

Wow! Your results look great. Ngl a lot of my dysphoria is related to my hips. I was afraid of a new surgery and risk of complications, etc but this looks really good and it kinda makes me want to think about doing this surgery.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad your recovery is going well after the revision and I think your results are awesome!

Wow thanks for this I got a quote from the same hospital but was put of by the lack of English references. This review really helps,
</p>
<p>
Do you have like a before / after shot of your hips? Like they look wonderfull and femme now, but what did they look like before? I really really want this surgery but need to know that the $20000+ will effect my 188cm 90kg frame

I’m sorry I don’t have any public images of me showing my typical male hips. Depending on what I wore, I used hip pads to hide my lack of curves - now no longer required thankfully. Suffice to say, I was very much straight up - straight down. There are some before/after ones the clinic took. Perhaps I can dig them out. You’re a little larger than me (I’m 176cm, 71kg) but I don’t think you should let that dissuade you.

Thanks for the reply,
</p>
<p>
Well there are several different types of iliac crest implants, Dr Eppley does silicone only ones, and pryia med in India has started doing it, so I was just wondering what “style” of implant would be best for me.
</p>
<p>
I’m talking to a girl right now who just landed in India to get them done with priya med, I’ll be following her journey.
</p>
<p>
Any how, thanks for this review it really helps, I’m going to add this clinic to my list!

Oh thank you. She&#39;s probably the one featured in their YouTube channel. Pretty nice price tag for the package too. I don&#39;t think my insurance will let me get anything out of country unfortunately 🥲

Hi MejaFoss!
</p>
<p>
I have recently found this post and I’m interested in this Pelvic Plasty surgery. So it has been under a year since you returned to S. Korea for your revision (surgery). I’m interested to know how you are doing? Are you still experiencing nerve pain in your left hip or has this gradually eased over time? Are you still happy with the results of your revision a year on (well almost)? Would be lovely to hear from you! I hope you are doing well!

Wow I didn&#39;t even know that was a thing.  It&#39;s starting to look like anything will be possible.  I&#39;m excited.
<br>
Though I am already built pretty much like a girl there that I&#39;m able to do my full front and side splits that I rigorously practice on all the time and would hate to mess that up. But maybe it could help me also. Because I do still struggle to be as limber as I shoot for and have almost reached my limits and short of my goals.  You look great.

Thankyou 💜 I’m sorry I’ve no idea. I would

not but you’d have to get clarity from both Dr Won and your BBL surgeon to confirm for sure.

Have you got a scan of the titanium implants - and how much difference did 35mm make.
</p>
<p>
How come the titanium implants plus the silicon implants - say rather than a larger titanium implant?

You’re welcome and hey that is such a good question! I was able to lay and sleep on my side before the 2nd revision ok - on my left hip at least. Now after this latest revision I’ve been trying to leave it as long as possible before I go to sleep on my sides again, so I’m not doing it yet. However I can comfortably get into those positions and I feel like I could start sleeping on them quite soon.

Yeah I think the silicon sits lower down the leg below the titanium implant. The titanium feels like my pelvic bone so it is pretty hard. The silicon is to smooth out the curve so it blends nicely into my leg 💜

<p>
just to clarify, the silicone implant sits over the
<a href="https://www.floridaortho.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Hip-Muscle-Strains-Graphic.jpg" rel="nofollow">gluteus medius muscle
</a>
right? or is it lower down?
</p>
<p>
And is there an option for the surgeon to use a fat transfer (like in BBL) instead of silicone?

Hi sorry I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️ That
<em>
feels
</em>
about right but you’d need to get clarification from the surgeon exactly where it sits anatomically. And same for the fat injections - it wasn’t discussed as option for me possibly as I don’t have enough to transfer.

I don’t really have any public ones no. I’m a late transitioner so my pelvis was basically never going to respond to hormonal changes. As such it was of fairly typically ‘male’ dimensions

I understand. It is difficult to appreciate the change for us, but I will definitely say you look fine and you have a natural curve. I guess this is what the operation aims.

Hi, It’s a year on now, I’m thinking of getting this surgery and have contacted Dr Won.
</p>
<p>
How are you doing now? Are you still happy with how it’s turned out?

So query... I&#39;m sure many ppl have already ask you this, but without silicone implants is there a limitations of how much mm can you add to each side if the pelvic ( titanium implants)

Actually I think you are the first to ask me this. And I don’t really know but my guess would be that it wouldn’t affect the size of the implants. Just that they may look a bit odd without the smoothing effects of the silicon packs. As always, for a definitive answer you’ll need to contact the clinic 💜

Weird question? But did the plates get detected at the airport? Or did you have to explain it I&#39;m curious on how it works

Yeah they always set off the metal detectors at airports. I tell them I have metal in my hips and ask for a pat-down

I was actually going to ask the same question.  I&#39;m a Flight Attendant and wear silicon hip pads to fill out my uniform but would really like to get this surgery. However, whenever we get random inspected as at KCM (Known Crew Member) which is about 30-40% of the time, I wonder how problematic that would become. I guess I could just tell them the same answer as you, but it feels like it could be awkward to have this done with my crews present.  Do you know if there is a hard silicon alternative by Dr. Eppley?

Sorry I don’t know about other procedures. Re: my experience with airport security, it’s a slight hassle but usually fairly quick. I either get a pat down or go through the other scanning machine, and since my SRS everything goes pretty smooth. BTW: you have my dream job x
