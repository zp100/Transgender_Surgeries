So I am looking to get FFS in  Korea in the future  and was wondering what good surgeons are there for FFS since I know that the procedures they do In Korea are much more drastic than the west . I  am considering ID hospital since I have seen amazing pictures from them but I have also heard some bad things about them online . Does anyone have any recommendations for doctors or hospitals/clinics in Korea or should I stick with ID hospital ? Also does anyone know good medical tourism agency&#39;s that can arrange everything for me in Korea  since I don&#39;t know how to speak Korean ?

Iâ€™m white caucasian. Over 40. Almost 50ðŸ˜„. And I finished a lot surgery in Korea. I was some money. For couple surgeryâ€™s in US. I worked 9 months for getting surgery in UofUâ€¦.. Tired. Drop this. Few months spent on online consultation with in Korean plastic surgery clinics. Choose. And made surgery. A lot on face. BA. Hair transplantation. And Iâ€™m happy with results.  Do what needs for you.

Some surgeons/hospitals give discounts to influencers to say nice things about them, and ghost doctors donâ€™t happen if youâ€™re famous. Korea is (more) risky if you donâ€™t do your research properly.
