Do you know how the results would differ to Suporn technique, in terms of self lubrications and sensation?

Is there an issue with being able to mark a post NSFW as you&#39;re posting it? I remember people mentioning they had to go back and edit to mark NSFW.
</p>
<p>
Also, could we by default mark all image submissions NSFW? I think every image posted to this sub qualifies.

I think people just forget to mark it nsfw. I&#39;ve done that myself.

I don&#39;t know how to default mark images as nsfw. Do you know if its possible?

I was hoping you would know... &gt;&lt;
</p>
<p>
I assume it IS possible, since the various porn subreddits have everything tagged NSFW. Maybe that requires something different when the sub is created?

You can set the entire sub to be nsfw, but for whatever reason this one is not. It&#39;s why I made the wiki on a separate sub.

Back in April I had an orchiectomy and also had my scrotum removed. At the time I guess I wasn&#39;t thinking of future surgery and I just wanted my calls gone, with the aspheric of not having loose skin hanging there afterwards.
</p>
<p>
After a few months I realised I eventually wanted SRS. I knew that having no scrotum would pose issues... but my hopes were raised when I heard about Suporn and his technique (and the fact he can use material in the cases where not a great deal is available)....
</p>
<p>
... however I just received this email and to be honest I&#39;m totally devastated:
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Our surgeons have now seen your pictures and feel that the complete excision of testes and scrotal tissue along with scarring extending onto the penile shaft have reduced the amount of material available for their SRS technique beyond where they believe they can produce a successful SRS outcome. Iâ€™m sorry to tell you that they would not attempt to perform SRS for you. They suggest the only realistic way for you now to complete a SRS with a normal vagina is to create the vagina by a technique called colonvaginoplasty in which the material for the vaginal lining is harvested from a section of the colon, leaving the remaining penile tissue for creation of the external genitalia. However, we do not undertake colonvaginoplasty procedures, and we suggest you contact one of the many SRS surgeons who offer it as an option.
</p>
<p>
We do not specifically recommend any surgeon, but to help you start your research, we know that Dr Chettawut in Bangkok does the procedure, and you might consider it worthwhile to get in contact with him. There are literally dozens of SRS surgeons world-wide who do the procedure, but we just donâ€™t happen to be among them.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m sorry the news is not what you would have wanted to have heard but donâ€™t despair too much, because options are available. We wish you all the best with your research into finding a suitable surgeon to help you.
</p>
<p>
Best Wishes
</p>

I know there are other possible options, but I had really high hopes for Suporn accepting me as his results really do seem to be superior to a lot of others out here.
</p>
<p>
I honestly don&#39;t know what to do now... I feel like if I go with any other surgeon, I&#39;ll just be accepting &#34;second best&#34; (no offence to anyone here that has had surgery with other surgeons).
</p>
<p>
Not sure where to go from here.... :(

Oh I thought your bad news was that you&#39;ll never be able to get it or there was a botched surgery. My personal opinion, although from limited research is that the method they described is better and what I would get if I were to go that route. I think it&#39;s more realistic and has better self lubrication. I have a friend doing that in February

When people refer to non-inversion working well for those with less &#34;donor material&#34;, they&#39;re referring to
<em>
penile
</em>
donor material, because a scrotal graft (which varies less in available tissue) is used for the vagina. Scrotectomy will negatively affect aesthetics, but peritoneal pull-through or a hybrid approach are worth looking into on top of colovaginoplasty.

There are a number of possibilities :
</p>
<p>
-surgeons using skin grafts. Disadvantage may be scars at the site where tissue is harvested.
</p>
<p>
-surgeons using colon methods, some use laparoscopic methods so it may be less invasive. There was a girl lately having this method with Kamol in Thailand and it may be possible to look up the thread.
</p>
<p>
-surgeons using perotoneal pull through methods. Bluebond-Lagner, Avanessian and Wittenberg in the US may be in this category, and in Europe for example genitalsurgerybelgrade. Its called Davidovy procedure.
</p>
<p>
Advantage can be permanent lubrication, like the colon method, which also can be a disadvantage if it is too much. With peritoneal methods there may be some tissue changes over time though towards what cis people have but it is more experimental, one disadvantage could be a thinner tissue.
</p>
<p>
It may be an idea to book a few consultations with a number of surgeons and discuss possible advantages and disadvantages.
