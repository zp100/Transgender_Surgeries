I can’t see how they will be able to restart in 2 months - the virus will surely be worse by then? I’d expect a certain amount of chaos for a while yet.
</p>
<p>
I am puzzled why there’s no reports of cancellations from other Thai surgeons.

<strong>
COVID-19 or Novel Coronavirus  -  Possible Effect on Your Upcoming Operation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Latest Information Regarding Measures Taken During Covid-19 Coronavirus Crisis – Update 5 March 2020
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cancellation of Some Operations
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The number of cases of Covid-19 Coronavirus worldwide continues to increase on a daily basis, and as yet there are no clear indications of the virus being brought under control. Because of the serious risks of further transmitting the disease by travelling from one affected area to another, we have decided the to cancel all operations in the immediate future while the World Health Organization and national governments fight to find a cure or vaccination against the disease.
</p>
<p>
We have not taken this step lightly and are acutely aware of the impact on individuals as a result of our having made this decision. While individual disappointment is understandable, we believe this is the only responsible step we can take to safeguard the health and safety of other patients, staff, doctors and other citizens and to help prevent further spread of the disease across multiple continents. The impact on affected individuals is very much regretted, but we will allow no exceptions to this decision under any circumstances.
</p>
<p>
This message serves as first notice that we have taken the step of cancelling all operations scheduled for the rest of March and April 2020, and will be accepting no patients at all during that period. Any client who travels to us in Thailand with the intention of having surgery during that period will be refused. This is not negotiable. We will be sending out a letter to every client affected by this decision. These should be received within the next couple of days. We are suggesting clients affected by the cancellations consider rescheduling from no sooner than July 2020 onwards.
</p>
<p>
There is obviously no financial penalty from our perspective for cancelling the operations, and expect the individual letters we will be sending notifying the cancellation will enable clients affected by this decision to claim refunds for their flights if they have already booked them.
</p>
<p>
We will keep the situation under constant review. If there is no clear progress made in bringing the virus under control, or if the situation worsens or we are directed to do so by government authority, we might extend the period to operations currently scheduled for May or June. We will review the situation constantly and keep you informed whenever the situation changes noticeably. This page on our web site will serve as the news desk regarding the status.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Backlog
</strong>
</p>
<p>
There will be a backlog created by these cancellations, which of course might increase if we feel obliged to cancel even more operations. To help with this, we will be allocating a larger number of dates available for operations in September, October, November and December – and possibly beyond if it becomes necessary to cancel more operations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Effect on Cosmetic Improvement Operations
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Clients scheduled for Cosmetic Improvement (CI) procedures who have been obliged to cancel as a result of our decision, will be given an extended period of grace in which to complete the CI without cost. The normal period is 18 months after the primary operation. Patients affected by this enforced cancellation will be given an additional 6 months period of grace, meaning they must complete the CI by 24 months after their primary operation. This extension is granted ONLY to clients who have had their operation cancelled by us because of the coronavirus situation. It does NOT extend to other clients.

Agree. This will be a thing for this year.
</p>
<p>
Big wave now, overloading healthcare systems across the world.
</p>
<p>
2nd wave possible in winter months together with influenza. And healthcare systems trying to get back to normal.
</p>
<p>
And too many unknowns. Can you get it again like the flu (influenza) if it changes a little bit? Making a vaccine even more important.

Unfortunately no. I don’t believe they will be releasing availability until they’re sure the virus is slowing down.
</p>
<p>
It’s more of a shock to me that other surgeons aren’t postponing treatment. It’s a troublesome time to be booking international surgeries at the moment, I’d hold off on anything until far later in the year. Imagine getting sick immediately post treatment.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I’ve had to cancel my up and coming FFS by choice. It wasn’t easy, but I don’t believe my surgeon is taking the precautions they should be taking.

Hard decision, but very sensible. I’m impressed you’ve don’t it.
