I&#39;d give HRT a few more years personally before considering augmentation.

Why would you do BA when 16 is the perfect time for HRT? You&#39;d be quite likely to just naturally grow them practically as much as your genetics say they should, if you&#39;d have a proper HRT regimen.

Thank you very much for your reply, I have been in HRT for a year and full time both at school and in everyday life, my parents fully support me and both for BA and SRS would agree to let me do it as soon as possible and possibly in Europe, I know that recently my parents made contact with a Doctor from Barcelona, ​​Ivan Manero if I&#39;m not mistaken that he would be willing to operate on me by next spring and all would be legal with the consent of my parents what do you think ciaooo

I think you should wait with the BA because mainly it takes about two to three years for breasts to fully develop and it&#39;d be a waste of natural growth. Plus people often report an uptake in breast growth after SRS, so you should put that on the backlog for now until after SRS and about two to three years of HRT.
</p>
<p>
And besides, I&#39;m of the opinion that natural is preferable when you can reach the desired result naturally. It&#39;s a lot of money and hassle saved.
</p>
<p>
And... Punctuation. Please.

The minimum age is 18 for srs, for BA is 16(depends on the country). But if you want a BA before 18 you need parental consent

You are sure they provide quality care? I understand you want to go fast but 15 yr old wouw thats very young to undergo such intensive surgeries.
</p>
<p>
You are stil growing and might not get optimal vagina depth as your ladydick might not be of adequate  size to provide enough depth? Also wouw, already a year on hormones on age 15 is the youngest age ive heard about.  I always thought trans in Europe got hormone blockers untill age 16 or 18 and then got their hormones. You are going very very fast at such a young age.  Pleae be safe and look very well into quality care. Hugs &amp; kisses 🌹😘

Probably not useful, but there&#39;s some info here on minors getting SRS. I think they are all in the USA, so not relevant to you unless you can travel and have heaps of money.
</p>

</p>
<p>
And surgeons in Italy
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_italy">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_italy
</a>
</p>
<p>
You need to look at legal issues in Italy if you want surgery there. However I suspect you&#39;d be better off looking at surgery in other countries if you can afford it. I get the impression that they are not very good in Italy. In Thailand its is illegal before 18 and only with parental permission before 20.
</p>
<p>
You shouldn&#39;t get BA before your breasts have finished growing or you can cause yourself problems. Seems unlikely at 15. I&#39;d look into your HRT as well, because a lot of European countries are very backwards on HRT and you might find you can do better and not even need surgery.

Personally I’d not go to a surgeon without being very sure they are good, and I’d cant find out much about him. Perhaps you can if you’re local. I suspect it would be very difficult unless you know a lot of people who had surgery with him and can show you their results. It’s for life and there’s plenty of bad and second rate surgeons round. However I have the money to pick what I want, which obviously doesn’t apply to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Also, a lot of doctors can’t get a good result if you don’t have much genital development. Ie if you started hrt early in puberty.

I have already had the opportunity to see some of the results of his interventions and moreover he visited me very recently and reassured me about the final result and then he also put me in contact with other newly operated girls of my age, that is between 14-15 years.

Sorry kid but for most surgeries you gotta wait till your 16 to start hrt then another year to do any surgeries. I mean if you have the money you could do ba and srs but like those drs likely wouldn’t do a good job cuz your lack of  body maturity. Yeah plus if you did surgeries before the 1 year mark your body may become abnormal meaning you’d need more surgeries as your body matures. Theirs a reason for that rules to surgeries and Altho they suck they’re very reasonably there. It’s not just some dick saying I don’t like trans people so they deserve to wait, it’s actually a justifiable reason that if they alter your body before maturity when it dose mature you could have a massive difference in proportion.

Ciaoo yes I was lucky enough to have my mother who paid me for the interventions, interventions carried out by a professional, Dr Ivan Manero, who has already operated girls of my age so no problem for the age and economic possibility and, regarding maturity psychologists and gender therapists gave them the ok for the interventions so .....

I’d still wait until at least 18 for breast you should for the most develop through female puberty and start see growth during 2-3 years. Maybe consider progesterone if you’re not already on it

Idk about BA but there have been reports of people having SRS at ages younger than 18 but these are very special situations where in addition to parental support and consent, the child has been evaluated by multiple mental health professionals for a long time (usually a couple years).
</p>
<p>
If that’s not the case for you then you likely won’t be able to get SRS until you’re 18 (or the age of majority in your country). In some countries like Thailand you still need parental permission to get SRS until you’re 20.
</p>
<p>
I definitely understand your desperation my biggest advice is to start trying to save money if you’re planning to go to a private surgeon and if you’re planning to go through insurance in your country, then try and figure out what they require so you can fulfill those requirements as soon as you possible since the entire process takes time.

With adult permission you can get those done. However, since your 15 and probably on hormones you have to wait until your breasts develop (1-2 years) before having B.A

Thank you very much for your reply, I have been in HRT for a year and full time both at school and in everyday life, my parents fully support me and both for BA and SRS would agree to let me do it as soon as possible and possibly in Europe, I know that recently my parents made contact with a Doctor from Barcelona, ​​Ivan Manero if I&#39;m not mistaken that he would be willing to operate on me by next spring and all would be legal with the consent of my parents what do you think ciaooo

Wow thats pretty gross and really lacking in empathy to tell someone who obviously has bad bottom dysphoria that they should just wait a few years and do RLE because &#34;they can do it at any point.&#34; Like thanks, living with the wrong body parts for years more is going to be great for her mental health.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also just wrong that no surgeon would perform surgery before she&#39;s 18. There are more steps to do it, but it&#39;s something that definitely happens.

Personally i agree with everyone that you should wait for hrt to work before getting a ba, youll still have chest growth for a few more years.
</p>
<p>
For bottom surgery I&#39;d say go for it 👍 maybe do some research on the surgeon yourself to make sure they have consistently good results, but other than that should be good

Yea you&#39;re right. They should just do such intensive surgery on age 14 or younger while kids are stil fully developing mentally and stil have to go through puberty growth. Get real please. Dysforia is bad but to do BA and SRS at younger ages might hurt them more psychologically and fysically down the line. Aka not enough penile growth = not enough vagina depth.  Wich might cause sexual intercourse to hurt or not be satisfying enough.  Also breatsgrowth lasts untill around age 18 and sometimes early 20&#39;s.

Getting a ba before your boobs are grown is really dumb, but there are other types of bottom surgery than PI lol. You don&#39;t need to be well-endowed to get proper depth.
</p>
<p>
If a kid who&#39;s started puberty has dysphoria for more than a few months, the chances of it going away are basically 0. I&#39;m all for informed consent and a teenager is more than capable of deciding if they should get bottom surgery or not.

I have to wait till I&#39;m 18 for srs because of insurance, the doctor said he would do it younger if it wasn&#39;t for my insurance (I hope this helps)

Though you can get srs sooner I think 16 with consent and letters from providers depends on the country but I think that’s what the Thai doctors require

You can’t get SRS in Thailand before 18. It’s illegal. And since you’re still a minor before 20 in Thailand you need parental permission from 18-19.

Well don’t sound like she plans on going to Thailand. Though yes you are right my mistake. I know in US I believe some states allow for it at 16 with consent not sure if any surgeons will do it though and in a lot of European countries you can have it done as young as 16 with consent.

I would wait until you have stopped growing.
</p>
<p>
BA is an insignificant surgery so from my perspective the reason to wait is simply so that you do not have the surgery and then grow a significant amount. Just like it would be a bad idea for a cis female to have a BA at 15. With a BA it&#39;s important to get implants that are the correct size for your pectoral muscle, it&#39;s not possible to do that if you are still growing.
</p>
<p>
I think SRS has the same growth requirements. I&#39;m really unsure about how it would change as you grow. Secondly SRS is a psychologically challenging experience with significant long term consequences so I would not rush into it.
</p>
<p>
I do not think there is a benefit to having either before being fully grown.
