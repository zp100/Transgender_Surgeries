Four weeks ago I had feminising srs at Dr. Lubos Kliniken (Team Markovsky) in Munich. I stayed in Pasing, some things may be different in Bogenhausen. The following is based off my original packing list, with some explanations, as well as things I wish I did or didn&#39;t take and some random info that I hope is useful. This is more of an aid to make your own packing list. It doesn&#39;t explicitly list a toothbrush for example. Also AMA
</p>
<h1>
Medication
</h1>
<p>
Whatever you normally take. Be sure to ask sufficiently early whether you should stop any medications. Also be careful about vitamins; some can mess up bloodwork and for example mine contain spirulina which shouldn&#39;t be taken together with anticoagulants, which we were getting once a day as precaution against thrombosis.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
hormones:
</em>
including antiandrogens in case surgery gets cancelled (which totally happens sometimes). You should stop them some time before surgery, but if you don&#39;t ask they may forget to tell you.
</li>
<li>
<em>
donut pillow
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
dilators:
</em>
when they give you your prescription for these they&#39;ll tell you a pharmacy very close to their practice where you can get them. Do that! Otherwise it&#39;ll be a huge pain trying to find a pharmacy that can order them and have costs covered by your insurance. I got the prescription the day of hospitalisation because it was a spontaneous appointment and I was told by the doctor to make sure to get it filled before going to the hospital, but then an assistant already called a cab for me and told me it&#39;ll totally be fine, I can still get it filled in Pasing. Once in hospital the nurse was severely annoyed about this.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Hygiene
</h1>
<p>
Whatever you need to feel like yourself. I wouldn&#39;t make too many compromises here. Sure you could live without conditioner and moisturizer for a month, but feeling a bit normal is going to be worth a lot? Though if you&#39;re not as lazy as me, repackaging or travel sizes to save some weight and volume would be a good idea. You&#39;re normally not provided with necessities like a toothbrush or toothpaste, so be sure to bring everything you need.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
hand disinfectant:
</em>
Of course there is disinfectant everywhere in the hospital, but not within arm&#39;s reach of your bed. Make sure to take one which you can also use on rubber gloves and without perfumes or whatever, so you feel comfortable touching your wounds afterwards, for example before dilation
</li>
<li>
<em>
razor (optional):
</em>
Probably you should take this anyway for the well-being aspect, but it&#39;s extra important as you have to shave the night before surgery. Of course the hospital can provide you with one for that, but you may not like theirs.
</li>
<li>
<em>
wet toilet paper (optional):
</em>
make sure it&#39;s without perfumes or anything. It&#39;s not necessary, but nice to have. Two packages should be enough
</li>
<li>
<em>
tissue dispenser box:
</em>
honestly I have no idea how everyone lived without one of these next to their bed
</li>
<li>
<em>
deodorant and/or antitranspirant (optional):
</em>
lying in a hospital bed all day can get surprisingly sweaty
</li>
<li>
<em>
dry shampoo, wet wipes (optional):
</em>
you&#39;re not allowed to shower for the first five days normally.. one package of wet wipes is plenty
</li>
<li>
<em>
pads „Maxi Binden“ (optional):
</em>
of course the hospital provides you with pads. The surfing board between your legs as one has lovingly called them. I.e. their huge in all dimensions and once your more mobile or at least for your trip back you may want something which doesn&#39;t fold and put pressure on your parts if you close your legs further than like 60°. The hospital ones are workable though, so I would only bring a single package of my own.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Sleep
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
stuffed animal (optional)
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
pillow or at least satin pillowcase (optional):
</em>
depends how picky you are about pillows and how important your hair not dying is to you. The hospital pillows aren&#39;t terrible and most people seemed to be fine with them- though without either you&#39;ll probably have a giant crow&#39;s nest after the first days.
</li>
<li>
<em>
hair scrunchy (optional):
</em>
or whatever type of hairband that&#39;s easy on your hair for putting it up when sleeping or lying in bed so that it doesn&#39;t tangle as badly
</li>
<li>
<em>
sleeping mask:
</em>
highly recommended if you can tolerate it. You and your roommates may not have the same idea of what is a good time to turn off the light
</li>
<li>
<em>
ear plugs or headphones:
</em>
whatever you&#39;d rather use to deal with your roommates snoring. Being forced to lie on your back the whole time does have one benefit in that you can wear overears for sleeping, so I didn&#39;t end up using my ear plugs. Everyone lying on their backs also means the chances of someone snoring are a lot higher.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Entertainment
</h1>
<p>
You&#39;ll figure this on out for yourself. Be sure to have some passive entertainment for the first few days and then some active entertainment too for when you get bored, though I took way too much and just ended up reading books on my phone.
</p>
<p>
WiFi was mostly perfectly usable though having a good mobile data plan on your phone with a bunch of volume might be prudent. Also maybe WiFi sucks in your room, I only tested my own.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
power strip:
</em>
at least from what I&#39;ve seen it doesn&#39;t need to have a very long cord as the plug is always right above and behind you where your bed also plugs into
</li>
<li>
<em>
cord (optional):
</em>
so you can tie the power strip to your night stand so it&#39;s easily accessible without taking away some of the very scarce space on your night stand. Though this is not really necessary, just nice to have maybe. I used rubber gloves to tie a few things including my power strip down. You may find other ways to make use of it too.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Food
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
snacks (optional):
</em>
there are vending machines if you&#39;re into that kind of thing, see below about coin money
</li>
<li>
<em>
spreads (optional):
</em>
in the evening you&#39;ll just get bread with butter or vegan butter and a salad and I really enjoyed having some spreads to put on the bread. Since it&#39;s late autumn I just put them out on the window sill between uses. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d still take some during summer or whether that&#39;s just going to be too much of a hassle. I&#39;m sure you can get some jam or honey for the bread too if you want to.
</li>
<li>
<em>
tea (optional):
</em>
there is a tea and coffee station where you can serve yourself for free. The following was available when I was there: coffee (batch brew); instant coffee; instant decaf coffee; hot water; tea: green, black, peppermint, herbal mix, fennel, fennel-anise-caraway, fruit, rosehip, chamomile, rooibos (though not everything was available all the time). If you want something else or just want to be sure you have some specific tea you could bring it yourself.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Clothing
</h1>
<p>
I took way too much. First of all, you don&#39;t need panties. You&#39;ll be provided with single use underwear which you&#39;ll be wearing the entire stay and if you want to also on your trip home. You can hand wash things in the sink with hand soap or whatever you bring, though there is no way to close the drain. Besides panties the hospital will also provide you with as many hospital gowns as you want. These are not really useful as clothing on their own as even the ones you can tie at the back may still give everyone a nice view at your behind, but by wearing a sweater over it and if that&#39;s not enough an additional safety pin you can keep it together so it just looks like you&#39;re wearing a sweater over a hospital themed dress. Or just wear it as underwear under a sweater and pants. At any rate these are really useful for keeping your more difficult to wash clothes cleaner for longer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
safety pins (optional):
</em>
see above
</li>
<li>
<em>
pants:
</em>
one or two comfortable ones should be enough. Ideally ones with which you feel comfortable lying in bed too
</li>
<li>
<em>
sweaters:
</em>
three or four, ideally with pockets from which you can hang your catheter bag
</li>
<li>
<em>
socks:
</em>
nice and comfy ones or depending on season I suppose. Easily hand washed and quickly dried so you don&#39;t need more than two pairs really if you just wash one every day
</li>
<li>
<em>
overknees (optional):
</em>
I could have done without, but I liked having them. Especially sitting on the gyn chair can be a bit cold and these will make it a bit more comfortable. Also nice when styling the hospital gown as a dress. Though really not necessary. Like above, two pairs should be plenty.
</li>
<li>
<em>
shoes:
</em>
You need three kinds
<ul>
<li>
<em>
slippers:
</em>
for quickly getting out of bed
</li>
<li>
<em>
bathroom slippers:
</em>
for taking showers. I suppose these could be the same as your other slippers, but after taking a shower their going to be wet..
</li>
<li>
<em>
proper shoes (optional):
</em>
for when you want to walk more than a few meters, but don&#39;t want to wear the winter boots you wore during travel. I suppose these are the least important as you can also just walk around in your slippers; I just find that annoying
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>
long shoe horn (optional):
</em>
it was actually pretty helpful during the first two weeks. Doubles as a hook for picking things up from the floor
</li>
<li>
Whatever you want to wear during travel
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Miscellaneous
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
mirror:
</em>
Should be able to stand on its own, not too large, so that it fits under the blanket, magnification is also nice
</li>
<li>
<em>
scissors or pocket knife (optional):
</em>
useful eg. for opening packages sent to you. I suppose it&#39;s not necessary, but every time I put mine from the public table into my private locker someone asked where they went shortly after. I&#39;ve heard before about people using scissors to cut the pads to fit better, but I wouldn&#39;t want to get cotton flakes into my wounds..
</li>
<li>
<em>
phone, charger, power bank, headphones
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
wallet:
</em>
<ul>
<li>
<em>
coin money (optional):
</em>
the vending machines only take 5¢ to 2€ coins. Be sure to have some of those. Especially the day before surgery when you&#39;re not allowed to eat you may want to get some soda to get at least some calories. Though I suppose you could just bring one. Otherwise I didn&#39;t buy anything from the vending machines.
</li>
<li>
<em>
10€ (possibly):
</em>
if you don&#39;t have your dilators yet you can still get the prescription filled in hospital, but you&#39;ll need to have 10€ prescription fee and they won&#39;t be able to change
</li>
<li>
<em>
passport and insurance card
</em>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>
originals of preparatory blood work and other tests:
</em>
if you didn&#39;t do those with Dr. Lubos Kliniken themselves. I did with my general practitioner and they told me to bring the originals and send them by email before hand. They didn&#39;t end up needing the originals, they just want you to bring them in case they have problems with IT. Also while on the topic, think about whether you have any conditions that may interest them. I noticed days before leaving for surgery that they wrote „please bring relevant documentation about existing conditions like for example [...] lung function [...]“. I have asthma so I really hurried to get an up to date lung function at that point
</li>
<li>
<em>
trash bags (optional):
</em>
for dirty clothes and also it&#39;s really useful to tie a trash bag to your night stand. There is a roll of trash bags beneath the trash bag in use in every bin, so you could also just steal some of these.
</li>
<li>
<em>
something to keep ice packs cold for longer (optional)
</em>
: you&#39;ll be asked to interval cool your new parts regularly and having the ice pack be warm after one cooling session is kind of annoying. Nurses aren&#39;t always easy to get a hold of and even if you did they were chronically low on ice packs, so it&#39;s really useful if you can make yours last longer. I used my winter jacket to keep it cold, which I took anyway, due to it being almost winter, but maybe in summer I&#39;d try one of those isolated shopping bags.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Unnecessary (to me)
</h1>
<p>
Keeping things light is useful, especially since you&#39;re not supposed to lift heavy after surgery. Here are some things I didn&#39;t need.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The hospital provided me with a packing list which only contained things that were either common sense or actually unnecessary. Here are the ones from the latter category:
<ul>
<li>
<em>
towels:
</em>
A nurse confirmed to me that you don&#39;t need towels, not in Bogenhausen either.
</li>
<li>
<em>
20€ „for the TV“, 2€ „for the locker“:
</em>
the nurse from above told me you need these in Bogenhausen, but in Pasing I didn&#39;t
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<em>
qtips:
</em>
I do need these now that I&#39;m home, but in hospital I didn&#39;t
</li>
<li>
<em>
boxer shorts:
</em>
found these on some old list by Dr. Lidl and even bought a pack for 30€. They were perfectly useless
</li>
<li>
<em>
bathrobe:
</em>
I suppose you can use it and I&#39;ve heard some like them a lot, but I could&#39;ve really done without and it was so much volume too. I just wore mine only two times when we were out of hospital dresses to look for a nurse to ask for a fresh one. But maybe you&#39;d wear yours a lot. Really you&#39;ll just have to figure out what you want to wear and then take that. I never wear bathrobes in normal life so maybe that should&#39;ve been an indicator.
</li>
<li>
<em>
vaginal douche:
</em>
you&#39;ll need one at home when you come back, but not necessary while in hospital
</li>
<li>
<em>
guests:
</em>
obviously this depends on you. Just don&#39;t take it as an absolute must. Me, my family and my girlfriend went through quite some trouble trying to plan for someone to always be in Munich to support me as I&#39;ve heard that „you need someone to support you 24/7“. Ultimately we learned that due to Corona visits weren&#39;t allowed at all, so that was blown off again. I am honestly glad about it, because I think it just wouldn&#39;t have been worth it to me. Though I&#39;m rather introverted, didn&#39;t mind the monotonous hospital environment and was generally pretty psychologically stable throughout. At any rate I was perfectly content with the support I got from the nurses and my roommate&#39;s, together with the occasional video call.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Things to know
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Day of surgery is counted as day 0 by the team
</li>
<li>
When you arrive in hospital and unpack your things think about what you want to have during the next few days when you&#39;ll be glued to the bed and put those on your nightstand. Even the lower drawer of the nightstand will be hard to reach at first. Inside your suitcase is probably going to be the most difficult to reach place. Here are a few candidates for thing&#39;s to have next to your bed:
<ul>
<li>
<em>
tissues
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
hand disinfectant
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
wet wipes
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
deodorant
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
toothbrush and toothpaste:
</em>
when you still can&#39;t go to the bathroom you can brush your teeth and spit into a glass
</li>
<li>
<em>
hair brush
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
passive entertainment
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
phone, charger, headphones
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
medications
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
lip balm
</em>
</li>
<li>
<em>
slippers
</em>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Sneezing, laughing and coughing hurts at first. Try not to do it
</li>
<li>
At least during Corona they&#39;ll basically take you hostage the first time you set foot in any of their facilities the day of hospitalisation. I thought I&#39;d still have time between the preparatory appointment and going to the hospital at the other end of the city, based on the times I was given, but after my appointment in Bogenhausen they directly shipped me to Pasing via taxi. Be sure to have eaten before that as you won&#39;t get any food from them and once you start taking laxatives at around 13 o&#39;clock it&#39;s no more food until the day after surgery, so almost 48 hours. It&#39;s not that bad though as after surgery you&#39;ll probably be way to wasted to want to eat anyway.
</li>
<li>
You have to sleep on your back at first and I got terrible back pain from this the second night after surgery; I almost couldn&#39;t sleep at all, it was easily the worst night of my life. They&#39;ll have you try getting up and walking around the day after surgery, but you&#39;ll have problems with circulation at first; I almost passed out in the bathroom that evening and they had to carry me back into bed. However you really want to get back on your feet so that your not murdered by back pain during the night. You can ring the bell whenever you feel like attempting to get up and once that works at least sufficiently that you feel comfortable getting in and out of bed and walking on one spot right in front of your bed without passing out, ask if you can do that without their supervision. Furthermore don&#39;t sleep with the bed completely straight, but put it in a slight zig-zag. That one horror night I tried adjusting my bed, but couldn&#39;t and thought that&#39;s just because it&#39;s the night and your supposed to sleep. That&#39;s not a thing, it was just accidentally unplugged without anyone noticing when I almost passed out that evening.
</li>
<li>
If you press the button to call a nurse while there is already a nurse checked into your room it&#39;s an emergency call. The next nurse and a doctor will come sprinting. When I almost passed out the nurse where shouting at my roommate&#39;s to „press the red button“ and after some confusion one of them jumped out of bed to press some red button somewhere in the room when she could&#39;ve just pressed the one dangling over her bed.
</li>
<li>
Eating vegan is mostly possible, the food is pretty tasty and nutritious too; they even had some protein rich food in the vegan options regularly, like beans or quinoa. You&#39;ll get two packages of coffee creamer every morning for which they don&#39;t have a system to leave them out. Also the kitchen will mess up most of the time in some way. Sometimes they just give you the wrong amount of vegan butter packages, sometimes they give you normal butter, sometimes they give you a dish which straight up isn&#39;t vegan. One morning they forgot to fill my coffee pot with coffee, so I just got an empty coffee pot and a mug which I found rather funny.
</li>
<li>
You can have food, packages or letters delivered to you in hospital. You pick up food deliveries yourself at the entrance, but you should have one person wait inside so you don&#39;t accidentally shut yourself out
</li>
<li>
You can totally ask for any number of bread slices or buns as well as any constellation of toppings for breakfast or evening. So if you want a few more calories this is an easy place to adjust. I never tried asking for bigger portions of the main dishes, maybe that works too
</li>
<li>
Dilation
<ul>
<li>
I went relatively fast on the dilators and also cut out smaller ones fast, so that quickly I was only using size 5. I was told cutting out the smaller ones is actually not a good idea, as stretching too quickly can cause small tears which will then contract as they heal.
</li>
<li>
you can prop up your butt with a towel when dilating so that you have a bigger range of angles available.
</li>
<li>
The team only considers sizes 1 through 5 medically necessary. If you want to get the bigger sizes you&#39;ll have to get them yourself or have your gyn prescribe them for you, though mine also said 5 is sufficiently large
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll be asked to regularly put Lavanid gel on your wounds. It&#39;s quite expensive so they&#39;ll only give you a new syringe in exchange for an empty one. Make sure they give you two to begin with or ask them kindly for a second one so that you always have a full syringe.
</li>
<li>
You&#39;re not allowed to lift heavy (about &gt;5kg) after surgery due to the risk of an inguinal hernia. Though I was told carefully lifting my suitcase up a curb is fine, „just don&#39;t carry it around for hundreds of meters“. I also got some further instruction how to lift
</li>
<li>
You&#39;ll get increasingly exact approximations of when you&#39;ll be released. About a week before release they&#39;ll tell you something like „some time next week“, two days later „middle of next week“, two days later „we&#39;ll plan with Thursday and see how that goes“. If you&#39;re traveling home via Deutsche Bahn (train), now would probably be a good time to buy a Sparpreis Ticket, so that when they tell you on Wednesday whether you can indeed go home tomorrow you still have the option to cancel. Also communicate your travel plans with the doctors so they can cooperate with you. I think Sparpreis is a great option as it&#39;s affordable in contrast to Flexpreis, but in contrast to Super Sparpreis you can cancel and get back your money as a coupon (valid three years) minus a fee of 10€ up until 23:59 the day before travel. Sparpreis also includes travel by public transit from and to the train station at your departure and arrival city (only participating cities in Germany and only their inner zones; this includes the trip between either of the hospitals and the train station in Munich). Every DB ticket can be cancelled free of charge and for full return of the money to your bank account within 12 hours of purchase.
</li>

What a great service you have provided! How kind of you taking the amount of time you did writing all of this. I was going to suggest that the hospital give you plenty of pillows using an adequate amount of pillows to give leg support under your knees. I also get back pain early into sleep and get woken up it. I could sleep better in a hammock!
</p>
<p>
Glad everything worked out well for you.

I just got one myself. I think some got a prescription for it from their GP or maybe also from the Lubos Kliniken. However some didn&#39;t have one, so it&#39;s definitely something you should take initiative on.

They may prescribe one at the preparatory appointment a few weeks before surgery. I think some had family members send them one via post when they were already in hospital, maybe the hospital can also organise you one, once you&#39;re there, but I wouldn&#39;t count on it.
