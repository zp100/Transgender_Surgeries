I had Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) with
<a href="https://facialteam.eu/">FacialTeam</a>
in Spain in the fall of 2018 after 15 months of HRT and this is my in depth post on everything related to FFS, what I did and how it turned out.
</p>
<h1>
The beginning
</h1>
<p>
Long before I knew about the term FFS or what can be done I wanted to get my Adam&#39;s apple shaved.  There was no way to hide it, I hated it, and I thought it was the most prominent male feature on my face.  As I learned more about gender difference on the face I discovered how the Adam&#39;s apple while often cited as
<em>
the difference
</em>
between male and female can actually be less important than other things like brow ridge and chin shape.  Further, I discovered that every trait on my face leaned to the male side and just getting a trachea shave wouldn&#39;t be as impactful as I imagined.  The more I learned the more I realized that while HRT does change my face, bones don&#39;t change and I had some male bone shapes that only FFS could fix.
</p>
<h1>
Research
</h1>
<p>
I didn&#39;t start investigating FFS until three months HRT because I heard that most individuals waited a year to see how much HRT redistributes muscle and fat.  I now think the one year mark has more to do with how long the process is more than anything else.
</p>
<p>
Learning how the black box in your brain instantly genders someone was very helpful in being able to evaluate my own face.  The documents on
<a href="http://virtualffs.co.uk/">VirtualFFS</a>
, especially
<a href="http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/My_Facial_Feminisation_Thesis.html">My Facial Feminization Thesis</a>
were helpful in explaining it to me and I read them over the site several times.
</p>
<p>
The website for a fee lets you submit photos that are photoshopped showing you what you might look like after some FFS procedures.  The
<a href="http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/What_to_Send_Me.html">instructions</a>
for taking the photos are very good and I would highly recommend following them even if you are not going to get VirtualFFS, but simply for your own purposes.
</p>
<p>
With FFS you want to be objective.  It might be nice to take a flattering photo at the right angle with the right lighting, makeup, and hair/clothes it won&#39;t help you learn what you want to learn.  Pulling your hair back, no makeup, three different angles, bright clear lighting with a proper camera placement will tell you the harsh truth.  And if you want honest feedback on if you need FFS I highly recommend sharing photos of these types.
</p>
<p>
A big question I had when I was starting was how much HRT does, v.s. what is bones that can&#39;t change?  I took a set of photos at five months and a set the week before my FFS surgery at 15 months.  Comparing them the color tone of my skin changed dramatically and there are definite fat and muscle changes, but it was less pronounced than I would have thought.  Bones don&#39;t change and the fact that I had a &#34;tall&#34; chin didn&#39;t go away nor did the fact that I had a brow ridge.  Even something like my nose which is less about bone was thinner, but it was still convex with a more bulbous tip.  I started HRT with a low body fat percentage and so the real answer to my question was that after a year on HRT my face would look close to the same, but leaning feminine.  Being lean and with a low body fat I didn&#39;t have a ton that could change and there wasn’t, for example, 1cm of muscle or fat I could magically lose from my chin, it was all bone.
</p>
<p>
Most women have some part of their facial bone structure that is masculine, but for me, every part of my face was either a little masculine, or in the case of my chin height and Adam&#39;s apple they were definitely in the masculine range.  It became clear that while HRT does do magic I would require FFS.
</p>
<p>
After digesting all of the information it is hard to not automatically break down the facial structure of everyone around you and online.  I was horrified when I realized my brain would involuntarily now clock trans women and trans men.  Of course, I also started clocking all sorts of people that are not trans too and I would be watching a movie or just chatting with someone and would start involuntarily breaking down their facial bone structure.  Even some actresses I couldn&#39;t help but notice a prominent male feature in a way that I never would have seen before.  This reflex was only there when I was thinking about this all the time, but like a skill, it is pretty easy to access if I want.  The worst part about it though was when looking in the mirror I could see my own faults that HRT would never fix.
</p>
<h2>
VirtualFFS
</h2>
<p>
I got a virtualffs report and three photos done.  From the time I submitted photos and payment, it took several months.
</p>
<p>
The photos were great fun to look at and show off.  Side by side it looks like a brother and sister.  If the results were anything like the photos FFS would
<em>
clearly
</em>
make a positive change to my face and how others gendered me.  Just looking at the photos it is difficult to say why and it was like a hard game of &#34;spot the differences&#34; for kids.  In that way, I would say the photos are less useful than you would like.  I was left trying to reverse engineer why in one photo I would look like a brother and in the other a sister.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Way
</em>
more useful than the photos was the written report which I read over many times.  It went in detail into every part of my face and every change made in the photos, describing why it was male, by how much and what my options were to move them to be less male or female.  At this point I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to get done and it was reassuring to read a very detailed and comprehensive report not only agree, but provided me with more detailed reasoning and suggestions.  I used the report when deciding what I wanted to get done and where.
</p>
<p>
My plan was to come out after I male failed and in that regard the photos were also emotionally crushing. If I had FFS at something crazy like 6 months, based upon the photos (which were taken around then) I potentially could have gone full time after recovery!  Without FFS I would have to wait a lot longer, (maybe forever was my worry) for HRT to overcompensate for my male facial attributes.
</p>
<h2>
Consultation(s)
</h2>
<p>
The other half of figuring out what you want is figuring out who to do it.  I had put together a list of surgeons and began to learn what they do, how they do it, their costs, and reached out to the finalist for consultations or questions.
</p>
<p>
Something important to note is that you can&#39;t get a consultation the next day.  I scheduled my consultation with FacialTeam at 4 months HRT, but I had the actual consultation at 9 months HRT.
</p>
<h2>
FacialTeam consultation
</h2>
<p>
The set of photos that I sent to VirtualFFS I also passed along to FacialTeam.  My consultation was over Skype and it was handy for them to be able to pull up those high-resolution photos to go along with the real time, but low resolution (in comparison) video chat.
</p>
<p>
At this point I already knew what I wanted to get done, but it was reassuring that they recommended the same as what I wanted and the same that what was recommended by virtualffs.  I was not one of those lucky ones that is told I don&#39;t need X or Y like FacialTeam is known to do when they honestly don&#39;t think you need it.
</p>
<p>
For any consultation, I recommend preparing a list of questions or concerns beforehand so you don’t forget anything you want to discuss.
</p>
<h2>
Booking
</h2>
<p>
A few weeks after my consultation with FacialTeam and after reviewing my options I decided I wanted to go with them and put down a deposit for a surgery date that was around six months away.  I got put on the cancellation list too, but there are almost no cancellations and in the end I didn&#39;t get pulled ahead.  My surgery was on Monday, but I had to be there on the previous Friday for my pre-operation consultation.  If I had picked a day later in the week I could have saved some money by reducing the amount of time I had to be in Spain before surgery.
</p>
<h2>
Why FacialTeam?
</h2>
<p>
Time and time again I saw positive reviews from those that went to FacialTeam.  The results were natural, not overkill, not &#34;plastic surgery&#34; looking.  This is their primary specialty, doing possibly several surgeries a day, and have a well oiled company set up for just this.  And it wasn&#39;t just the photos that were put up on their website which you know are the best of the best, but it was the random individuals on Reddit that would talk about their experience and share their results.
</p>
<p>
While the price wasn&#39;t my primary concern it was hard not to notice that being based in Spain it was significantly cheaper than what some of the surgeons in the U.S. charge.
</p>
<p>
For any of the surgeons I was considering I would have to fly and I would have to pay upfront and see what I could get back from my insurance (who does cover some costs) so the fact that it was in Spain wasn&#39;t that big of a deal.
</p>
<p>
None of the work I needed to get done was overly masculine or complicated or anything so I couldn&#39;t choose one surgeon over another based upon that.  Also, there wasn&#39;t a specific &#34;look&#34; I wanted, just a reduction of what testosterone had done giving me whatever I would have looked like if I had not gone through male puberty, no matter if I end up pretty or not.
</p>
<p>
I am northern European descent, have &#34;Nordic&#34; skin, and scars are very visible and seem to either disappear right away or take a
<em>
very
</em>
long time to fade.  For that reason alone I was very interested in their coronal approach.  I do have a larger forehead, but I also had a bit of an M shape so combining the coronal approach with simultaneous hair transplants would create a curved hairline which might make a bigger difference than my hair height.  If I was still unhappy with my forehead and didn’t want to go the bangs route I could always get a scalp advancement down the road, but if I went elsewhere and developed a bad scar (from my genetic luck, not their skill) I can never get rid of that.
</p>
<h1>
Preparing for FFS
</h1>
<p>
After my downpayment, the first &#34;official&#34; thing I did was buy an airplane ticket thus locking in my surgery date and taking me off the cancellation list.  Buying the plane ticket made it very &#34;real&#34;.  If there was ever a time to buy insurance for your airline ticket, the time you went for surgery where you might have to stay a few more days is one of them.
</p>
<p>
After that, the next big one was getting blood work done.  I recommend getting that done at the earliest point possible just in case there is any issues or lost blood work.  Turned out my doctor&#39;s office doesn&#39;t automatically release all lab work and this took a week or two to figure out before being able to send to FacialTeam.
</p>
<p>
To send all the money over I also waited longer than I should have.  Because it was an international wire transfer there was the inevitable delay and I had to split it.  The final transfer finished the Friday before my Monday surgery which was cutting it really close.  I had a receipt from the bank saying it was sent out the week before and &#34;processing&#34; and it would have been okay, but still a pile of anxiety I could have avoided if I had just started transferring the final funds more than two weeks out.
</p>
<p>
In the weeks leading up to the surgery date I had a list a mile long to get done with dozens of things to do and it occupied all my time.  One of the more unusual things I did included finally getting around to making a will (it is major surgery after all).  I had several weeks covered by short term disability at work so that generated another pile of things to do to and get approved.
</p>
<p>
A few things I brought that I would recommend
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lip balm (and bring this with you to surgery so you will have it while in the hospital)
</li>
<li>
Tops that are easy to take on/off without touching your head such as button down shirts or with very wide collars
</li>
<li>
A few extra sets of clothes in case you throw up, get blood on what you are wearing etc.
</li>
<li>
Sandals or slippers
</li>
<li>
For hair transplants, small hair clips to keep your hair off them and make cleaning easier.
</li>
<li>
Contacts to wear after surgery if you are getting work done on your nose
</li>
<li>
Audiobooks you can listen to (or be distracted by) in bed without needing to put in contacts or wear glasses
</li>
<li>
Power adapter for Spain
</li>
<li>
Surge protector if you have more than one thing you would want to plug in
</li>
<li>
Compression socks (or something tight) to wear on the plane ride home to help reduce swelling
</li>
<li>
Digital copies of all paperwork and ID’s just in case they are lost
</li>
<li>
Sugar-free cough drops
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was terribly excited to go and was more nervous about issues that might prevent me from having the surgery rather than the surgery itself.
</p>
<p>
One of the things that gave me a lot of anxiety was that I would be flying with a passport that had not been updated yet and still had a photo that was several years old, but everything worked out and I arrived just fine.
</p>
<h1>
Help
</h1>
<p>
If possible I would recommend having someone else join you on this trip.  While I couldn&#39;t have someone there the entire time I was lucky enough to have someone fly in the day before my surgery and was there for just a few days to help.  Do try to give them a realistic expectation of what they might see you go through because it can be overwhelming for them too and critically make sure they get a block of time to themselves every day.
</p>
<h2>
Not alone
</h2>
<p>
One of the best parts of going to FacialTeam was that I met a dozen other girls at my hotel of all ages from all around the world getting FFS during the time I was there.  Every day we would eat meals together and talk for hours.
</p>
<h1>
What I had done
</h1>
<p>
From top to bottom: Hair transplants, forehead &amp; brow ridge reduction, nose, lower jaw reduction, chin advancement, trachea shave.
</p>
<h1>
Pre-FFS in Spain
</h1>
<p>
When I first arrived I had a chest X-ray and a CT scan.
</p>
<p>
Before the surgery, I had a pre-consultation where they go over everything that they are going to do in as much detail as you want.
</p>
<p>
For my hairline, brow bossing and forehead I had nothing specific, I was just looking to move across the line from male to female and I didn&#39;t ask any questions.
</p>
<p>
When discussing my nose, the work was going to be mostly about making it cleanly lined up with my forehead after my brow ridge would be removed.  I didn&#39;t bring celebrity photos or anything and was simply looking to have it moved from slightly masculine to slightly feminine.  The only change was to make it slightly less bulbous at the tip and rather than a bump a slight swoop.  Out of my entire FFS surgery, I did have one minor change that I would describe as cosmetic which was that my nostrils were very asymmetrical before and when the surgeon sowed my nose back up he made it less asymmetrical.
</p>
<p>
The major thing I cared very much about was my chin. Not the chin advancement, but the height reduction.  We drew some sketch lines on the CT scan, but what was written down on the surgical notes was 1/2 cm reduction from my entire jaw.  I later realize according to the scale on the image our lines were closer to 1cm and the result is that I had a reduction of only half as much.  For some reason, I was under the impression that the amount that could be removed wouldn&#39;t be determined until the surgery so I was spending my time trying to convey my wishes to have a reduction as much as possible and not realizing that no, we were discussing right then and there exactly how much would be removed and if I had drawn a 1/2 cm line on the CT scan I would have absolutely wanted to discuss it more.  In the end 1/2 cm is fine for my face, but the point being if there is something about your face that you care deeply about to go in depth during your consultation and make sure that your surgeon understands what you want to get done and make sure
<em>
you
</em>
understand what they are planning to do.
</p>
<p>
At FacialTeam they have a cooling mask you wear after surgery to help with the swelling.  This can be claustrophobic if you wake up from surgery wearing it.  During the pre-consultation if you can see, feel or even try it on that can help eliminate that.
</p>
<p>
On a lark I asked if I could keep my jaw bone that they were going to cut out and they said sure and wrote it in the surgical notes.  It was pretty cool to see after and I was sure customs would confiscate it so I took photos beforehand and bought it with me on the plane home, but they let it through and now I have part of my jaw bone at home with no a clue what I am going to do with it.
</p>
<h1>
Night before
</h1>
<p>
If you are getting your brow bossing removed really enjoy washing your hair one last time where the water won’t flow down into your eyes, but be instead be deflected away.  It took a few months before I adjusted to this new experience.
</p>
<p>
I know I was up very late just because I was so excited.  In retrospect given that you are about to have major surgery where you need every bit of energy, you can spare I would recommend asking for something to help you sleep if it is allowed.
</p>
<h1>
FFS
</h1>
<p>
The morning of the surgery I was beyond excited, bubbling, and grinning from ear to ear.  I took a photo before heading over to the hospital which I will cherish, but I do wish I had taken a video of how I felt when I was in the bed right before surgery because I was so happy and excited.  The surgery was almost 13 hours and the last thing I remember was the anesthesiologist telling me to think of something happy and every time I think of that I still smile.  When I woke up everything seemed fine and I actually have a photo from the first hour where my face actually looked pretty good.  Little did I know how much pain and swelling was to come, but right then I was happy.
</p>
<h1>
A Typical recovery
</h1>
<p>
From what I can gather here is a typical recovery:
</p>
<p>
Coming out of surgery you might not be able to speak and you will be attached to the bed with the catheter, blood drain, IV, and at FacialTeam the cooling mask.  You may or may not develop swelling.  You might get it immediately or it could come over the next few days (day two-four seems to be the most swelling?).  If it doesn’t happen immediately you might actually look sort of okay for the first few hours.  If you had a rhinoplasty in the first night you will probably throw up and get less sleep than you want.  You might lose some weight, maybe 2-4lbs+ just from not moving and not eating as much as you should.  You won’t have much energy especially at the start, but you will be able to move around.  Your jaw as well as your whole face will be sore and tight.  Getting up will make you dizzy.  Bending over can make you extremely lightheaded.  Soups and soft foods are your friend especially the first few days.  The first few days you will be sore and tired more than anything and the painkillers should deal with any residual pain from the surgery.
</p>
<p>
After a few days you will really enjoy a solid meal after cutting it up into tiny pieces.  After the worst of the swelling you should be better each day and after nine days or so the sutures are out and while still low on energy you can do things at this point, even some touristy stuff.  At this point you can move your eye brows a bit again.  By week two or really three going back to work or school.  Still be careful about bending over because doing something as simple as putting away dishes could make you pass out.  Full energy seems to return anywhere from two weeks to two months.  Try to walk and move and do light exercise every day once allowed by your surgeon as it will help a lot with your energy returning.
</p>
<p>
If you had chin/jaw surgery you will have to wear a wrap/chinstrap the first month or so and brush your teeth after every meal to keep the sutures clean.  The silly major swelling goes away after a week or two.  Bruising from the surgery and swelling can take four+ weeks to go away.  After just a few weeks the person on the street they probably won’t know you had major surgery on your face.  A bunch of the remaining swelling goes down the first 6 weeks.  Sensation returns in your scalp after a few months (but has its own pace and can even return even after years).  After four to six months you get a good idea of where you will look like in the end, but it doesn&#39;t finalize (especially with rhinoplasty) for up to 12-24 months after surgery.
</p>
<h1>
My First six weeks of recovery
</h1>
<p>
Unfortunately, I seem to have drawn the unlucky straw and had a more difficult recovery than most.  It is important that you know that your body might give you the finger and try not to get too scared and let those that are there to help you know.
</p>
<p>
After being in surgery for 13 hours my limbs especially my legs were incredibly sore from being in one position for so long, something that took around two months to recover from.  The first night was unpleasant throwing up blood over and over and getting only a few hours of sleep. From the long surgery and continued bed rest I developed two sets of bedsores which further caused sleeping difficulties.  The first morning my swelling started and my left eye closed it up entirely.  I could barely stand, let alone walk, couldn’t eat, and was constantly crying and in a pretty messed up state.  I was in pain, but it was a major surgery so I tried to make the best of it and work on getting better.
</p>
<p>
The second night was difficult too and I hardly slept again.  The second day I forced myself to eat and walk up and down one hallway and ended up just crying on and off for hours unable to nap.  When they washed my hair I found myself sobbing from the pain before finally heading to the hotel where I could only eat soup before heading back to my room to try to not throw up and attempt to sleep again.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know it, but when I came out of surgery I had a very large and extremely painful hemorrhage across my face that didn’t drain and turned into a very painful hematoma, but it was hidden because it looked like just massive swelling.  This is what caused me to have such a hard time.
</p>
<p>
Every morning for the next four nights I found swelling to be worse and on the fourth day I woke to my entire face being swollen and barely being able to see out of one eye.  Even though it was scary this was luckily the worst as far as swelling and bruising went and over the next few days each day the swelling was less.  Using a scale at the nurses office I found that I lost around eight pounds compared to before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The fifth night I had a fever and was throwing up.  As the weekend continued I was in so much pain for so long that I started flinching if anyone would approach me for fear that they might possibly touch me and cause more pain.  I built up the courage to ask another girl if she flinches and she looked at my like I had two heads.  When I would see the other girls I would put on a smile and try to make them laugh because I assumed they must be in so much pain too.  My energy was so drained I wasn’t able to go up a single flight of stairs without mentally preparing and even then I might find myself sitting down half way to cry.  Everyone else was recovering and so I pretended that I was getting better too so others wouldn&#39;t worry.  At this point my friend had left, I was alone and very scared.
</p>
<p>
Luckily as the swelling from ffs started going down I realized I had this massive different swelling on most of my head.  I
<em>
finally
</em>
reached out to FacialTeam and went in the next day to have them look at it at which point they immediately saw what it was and drained the hematoma which was life changing and I went from a pain level 10 to 1 in a matter of minutes.  My mental capability began returning within hours and I slept for hours straight that night for the first time since surgery.  Two days later I felt hungry for the first time since surgery.  My description of the first eight days would be terrified and I had just been surviving.
</p>
<p>
While I tried to move and walk every day and by three weeks I was only able to push myself and walked for fifteen minutes.  Between week three and four my energy started to come back and by week four I felt like I could actually plan to do something each day rather than just getting through the day and by week five I could have returned to work.  There is no chance I could have returned to work before five weeks.
</p>
<p>
I cried almost daily in the month following surgery.
</p>
<p>
I have re-written this many times and downplayed everything.  I don’t know how close my experience was to an actual average one, but I know
<em>
it was a terrifying experience for me
</em>
.  I wasn&#39;t prepared for what happened and honestly am embarrassed at how I behaved at times when I was just trying to deal with so much pain.  I spent weeks thinking back on events over and over for hours a day, replaying them in my head over and over, I couldn&#39;t escape it.  My therapist recognized this as an acute trauma response and I spent some time with her help getting over it.  If you critique part of it or say that it was actually pretty close to the normal experience all I will do is shrug.  If you want to comment about it you can simply say &#34;sorry you went through that, wish I could give you a hug&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I made a million excuses every day all day about why it was all
<em>
my fault
</em>
that I wasn’t getting better each day that first week.  Transition is something I have had to do on my own, but this was not the place for me to be on my own, I had support and I should have reached out and used it.  I should have let them help me figure out what was wrong.
</p>
<p>
If you find that each day you can say “I am not better than yesterday” you need to tell someone.  Don’t try to solve it yourself, when your brain is running on fumes you are not capable of figuring it out.  Let your friend or coordinator know even if just to say you are not making progress or not sleeping so they can figure it out what is wrong.  That is their job and not yours.
</p>
<h1>
Voice Recovery
</h1>
<p>
Between intubation for the surgery and the tracheal shave my neck/larynx was quiet swollen and so my voice changed to something that sounded like an old man with a cold. I sort of knew that I shouldn’t stress my voice at all so I just dealt with it.  Unfortunately, FacialTeam&#39;s recovery documentation (which is pretty extensive for everything else) has no mention of what you should do with your voice after surgery.  I highly recommend reading over this
<a href="https://www.2passclinic.com/ffs/tracheal-shave/aftercare-tracheal-shave-voice-recovery/">tracheal shave voice recovery aftercare from 2passclinic</a>
document.  Specifically in the first two days give your voice as much of a rest as possible.  Also know that recovery of your voice can take a day or two or it can take months.  It wasn&#39;t until almost three months that my voice started to return to what it was before.  Before that point, I spent many days talking as little as possible or not at all.
</p>
<p>
This ended up being very hard for me.  My voice was the very first thing I worked on with my transition before anything else, before I was even completely convinced I was transgender.  I have spent a lot of time learning, working at it, and switched my voice publicly and full time even before starting HRT.  I was willing to hold off everything else, but not this, and changed my voice full time even a year before coming out at work.  I always thought that I was most dysphoric about how my face looked, but after this experience, I might say that my voice is equal or maybe higher on the list.  Speaking in my voice from the moment I wake up until I go to bed without it consuming effort was very core to whom I am.  Having to speak in this other voice caused me an extreme amount of distress.
</p>
<h1>
Post FFS depression
</h1>
<p>
Other than the one person who accompanied me everyone I interacted with in Spain I had never met before.  They didn’t know what I used to look or sound like.  I never had to come out to them, they never accidentally deadnamed me or used old pronounce out of old habit.  They met me when I was presenting as female with a female name and they happily placed in the female box.  I didn’t have to ‘come out’ to anyone, I didn’t have to justify my existence to anyone, I just got to be me.  Little things like going down to the beach I wore a summer dress and it wasn’t a big deal because it was just assumed I had presented this way my whole life.  It took several days to get used to having this cis privilege and it was wonderful.  And then I go and have a major gender confirming surgery.  I have had a life changing experience like no other and return home a new and better person only to see my father a few days later and have him crush me when he says ‘There he is!’.
</p>
<p>
To everyone else it was just another two weeks like any other two weeks of the year.  Even though my face was significantly more feminine out of habit they still put me in the male box.  If there was ever a time where I gave very serious thought to moving to another city and starting over this was it.  Being me during the whole trip was utterly intoxicating and if I went and started over everyone I would meet would know me first as a woman without the baggage of transitioning.
</p>
<p>
This seems to be a fairly common occurrence.  You have a major gender confirming surgery that you have looked forward to for a very long time and you get fantastic results, but everything else in your life seems to be about the same.  It is no surprise that post surgery depression is very very real and very common.
</p>
<p>
After returning home I went from someone who is always very optimistic to one that was very pessimistic.  I started thinking every bad thing I had ever thought about my transition was going to absolutely going to come true and started going to a very dark place.  Add on top of that the fact that I was still healing, lost my voice and a complete lack of energy doesn’t help either.  I was completely broken and the idea of having another surgery at some point was too much.  For the first time since before starting HRT I had suicidal thoughts.  It took several months to emotionally heal and return to my pre-ffs self.
</p>
<h1>
Bruising and swelling
</h1>
<p>
My bruising was very standard from what I can gather.  Black and blue all over fading to yellow before fading away by eight weeks.  A makeup color corrector wheel is perfect for hiding the various colors on your face.  The swelling on my eyes stretched out my skin which looks like it will take a while to go back to how it was before.
</p>
<p>
When flying home because I wasn&#39;t allowed to wear sunglasses every single flight steward upon seeing me with black eyes and bruises on my face asked me if I was okay in the way that they are pretty sure I was recently beaten.
</p>
<p>
The swelling seems to come in a few different stages.  The first week my entire face swelled up dramatically followed by bruising.  This dramatic swelling went down rapidly by the second week.  The first month the tight skin on my nose and especially my forehead looked a bit odd, sort of pulled and shiny.  It could almost be described as an allergic reaction type of swelling.  This continued to go down and at four weeks unless you told someone you were swollen they wouldn’t notice it and by six weeks it had gone down enough that I even had some wrinkles back.  While it wasn&#39;t done, the most dramatic reduction in swelling all occurred for me in the first six weeks.  By three months a lot more of the subtle swelling all over decreased, but especially on my forehead and under my jaw.
</p>
<p>
As the swelling went down and my nerves healed I was able to feel more as time went on.  The swelling on my head didn&#39;t hurt and at most felt similar to wearing a snug helmet.  By week eight I could feel all the way to my hairline again.  By three months I regained feeling in most of my face with only a few spots that are tingly.  The swelling on top of my head has started to go down and with it I began regaining feeling there too, moving one centimeter at a time and at a year I still have an inch left that is partially numb.
</p>
<p>
On the incision line everything behind it wasn&#39;t swollen and everything in front of it was so it made this funny little change in height &#34;bump&#34; that I could feel.  By three months some places are smooth while others are not.
</p>
<p>
Swelling on the nose takes the longest (up to 24 months).  Even though I know my nose will be smaller in the end even after three months it is still wider than before FFS and I can still feel that it is swollen and bumping it really hurts.  My nose will be no doubt the last thing that heals.
</p>
<h1>
Scarring
</h1>
<p>
By three months I can&#39;t see the scar on my nose at all without closely looking and the one on my neck while still visible is much less dark.  The scar across my head is still red, but pretty light.  It seems to be making good healing progress and I have a hard time finding it.
</p>
<h1>
Reactions
</h1>
<p>
I was very curious to see how others would react.  When you compare the before and after photo side by side they are
<em>
dramatically
</em>
different, but I was left speechless the first time someone told me they couldn’t tell that my face was different.  For those that knew I was having surgery, I have been told that I still look like me, but they can’t put their fingers on it and say maybe &#34;softer&#34;.  And like a hair cut it only takes a moment for their brain to adjust to how you look and assume you always looked that way.
</p>
<p>
When someone looks at my face now they see a woman and expect to see no brow ridge, small chin, a small Adam’s apple, etc so nothing looks off in that regard.  FFS is weird in that it is a
<em>
major
</em>
surgery on your face and people can’t seem to tell because it now better matches their internal expectations of how women look.
</p>
<p>
When I returned to work I decided not to tell people.  I did get a number of people explicitly saying I looked great which had never happened before and one person after pondering said that I looked &#34;younger&#34; and that was it.
</p>
<p>
What I wasn’t expecting about my face is my own reaction when I looked at pre-ffs photos.  Before FFS I didn’t want to show anyone my pre-HRT photos because they were so masculine in comparison to then.  Immediately after ffs I no longer want to show any pre-ffs photos because they were so masculine in comparison to now.  My friend took a photo of the two of us right before surgery and while how-old.net says I am female I am shocked at how masculine I look in it.  Just days before I saw my face as very feminine, but given how much more feminine my face is now it is hard to not see my old face as anything but masculine in comparison.
</p>
<p>
I have a handful of photos taken around 10 months HRT where I saw a woman in the mirror for the first time.  Unfortunately, I can no longer see her in those photos which is extremely sad.  Only in those photos taken more recently where HRT had done and lot more and everything else was together from hair, clothes, makeup, and accessories do I see a woman, but with a more masculine face than most, but still a woman.  Clearly, my own brain had adjusted to how feminine my face has become more than I realized.
</p>
<h1>
Results
</h1>
<h2>
Intellectually
</h2>
<p>
The hair transplants filled in the two corners and made a curve across the top of my forehead.  The hair continued to grow for a while, but after a few weeks the donor hair fell out (not the roots!) which even when I knew it was going to happen still freaked me out.  By three months the hair had started to re-appear and from what I have read will take up to a year to fully fill in.
</p>
<p>
My brow line is now completely smooth, around both eyes, above the middle and across my forehead.  This resulted in my eyes looking much more open and if my eye brows were raised it was perhaps a few millimeters at most, I am unable to detect it.  The work is very natural.
</p>
<p>
My nose went from convex with a little bump and pointing down at the end to concave with a smaller bulb at the end.  My nostrils are a bit more visible as a result.  Nothing dramatic and already (even with the swelling that remains) it is a natural feminine nose.
</p>
<p>
On the profile the line from my hair down to the tip of my nose rather than having the typical male bumps it is very smooth down to a slight swoop on my nose.  My profile from this perspective is dramatically different and extremely feminine.
</p>
<p>
My entire jaw having lost pretty close to exactly 0.5cm is shorter.  This is much more dramatic in the 3/4 view compared to the front on view.  Something that bothered me for a long time is my Gonion&#39;s (The corner of your jaw, where the &#34;ramus of mandible&#34; meets the &#34;body of mandible&#34;, also known as the &#34;angle of mandible&#34;).  Mine had grown not only down in the typical male fashion, but also out and had a knot shape that I felt and hated for years.  The knot was barely visible and a very minor gender marker, but it is
<em>
so
</em>
very satisfying to have it gone and I regularly feel my jaw line and smile when it is not there.
</p>
<p>
My chin is slightly shorter from the 0.5cm loss, shaped much more round and pointed and was moved forward several millimeters.  I was hoping to reduce the height more (1cm), but the new size combined with the new shape much more fit my facial proportions than before.  While I was looking for a little more in reduction, what was done is dramatic on the side or 3/4 view where the total volume of my chin/jaw is significantly reduced and is especially noticeable in side by side comparisons.
</p>
<p>
My larynx which had been quite prominent before still has a slight bump and is visible, but looks natural enough now.  Given the size they said it was not possible to entirely remove the bump, but did a good job.  I am not going to lose any sleep over this or investigate it more, but I have pondered if I went somewhere else they would have used a different technique to be able to remove more or if most likely they would have said the same thing.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the work is very good and natural.  Each one of these changes eliminated growth from testosterone leaving me with a feminine face.
</p>
<h2>
Emotionally
</h2>
<p>
At four weeks post FFS I took a photo before bed without makeup and for the life of me couldn&#39;t see a male no matter how hard I look.  This is of course a combination of 16 months of HRT, facial hair removal, growing my hair out and FFS, but I know FFS played a huge part.
</p>
<h2>
Grab bag
</h2>
<p>
My phone thinks I am a new person it has never seen before.  When returning home every single person that saw my passport I had to show the note from FacialTeam and two explicitly told me to update the photo when I get home.  How-old.net now genders me female in almost every photo no matter the angle, lighting, makeup etc.
</p>
<h2>
One year post FFS
</h2>
<p>
It is worth mentioning that never once did I ever regret my decision to have FFS.  Never ever once did I think I wish I had my old face back.  It was horribly traumatic, painful emotionally, and physically, but I never questioned my decision.
</p>
<h1>
TL;DR
</h1>
<p>
It took more than a year from beginning my research until I had FFS.  After the surgery I still had weeks and months for bruising to disappear, the swelling to go down, the hair transplants to grow in and my voice to return.  Like so many things in my transition, there is a lot of waiting.
</p>
<p>
FacialTeam did a wonderful job and I would recommend them.  From the actual surgical work which I have no complaints about to how smoothly they run their operations and how I and the other girls were treated.  From pre-ffs to post-ffs and while in Spain I never had issues contacting them with questions.
</p>
<p>
Getting FFS moved my face from masculine to clearly feminine and gave me a lot of confidence in myself and how I am seen by others.  It is my face, but simply moved across the gender spectrum.  The experience might have been hard, but very much worth it.

A very thorough and honest account, thank you. I&#39;ve passed it on so the team may learn from it and take on board suggestions about detection of problems as well as caring for the voice and bed sores (we do take extensive precautions but some people are more prone to this). We appreciate the details so we may continue to improve our pre and postop instructions and protocols in due course.  Regarding the immediate postop period, which I&#39;m sorry to hear was especially difficult in your case, we now have a team of our own 5 nurses who conduct &#34;home&#34; visits in the new recommended accommodations, La Villa Marbella (in the city center). Since Aldea is no longer open, the change in recommended accommodations has provided the opportunity to improve our own services and create the current team of 5 aftercare nurses. The intention of the more specialized FT nurse visits (as opposed to the general nursing in Aldea) is for earlier detection and resolution of surgical-related issues like pain that do not respond to the prescribed analgesics. Although we also have a staff psychologist for both patients and companions, who is available before surgery also to help deal with any extreme anxiety, she does not see all patients automatically on a daily basis in Marbella, something that might have helped in your situation.  Your story will surely benefit many readers, FT included, thank you again for the contribution.

Which hotel did you stay at? I thought everyone stayed a difference places and you didn&#39;t really get to meet anyone else.

I stayed at the Aldea La Quinta Health Resort.  Not everyone stays there, but enough people are there that as others would leave new individuals would arrive and we would invite them over to join us for meals and chat.  FacialTeam does 2-4 surgeries per day so that is a lot of patients in the local hotels.  They recommend a set of local hotels so I am guessing that even if I went somewhere else I could find some friends.

That&#39;s the specialist medical recovery hotel? Did you get any benefit out of staying there vs somewhere else?
</p>
<p>
How do they manage multiple surgeries per day? Each surgery always seems to take so long.

There was a nurse on call which not only washed my hair each day and cleaned the suture lines, but also helped me with a few other things including my injection when I was still working on walking and seeing from my swelling.
</p>
<p>
As for multiple surgeries per day, not everyone gets everything.  Some surgeries are no doubt only a few hours or less.  Also as the name implies FacialTeam has more than one doctor and the doctor that did your nose might only do noses and is not in the operating room all day.  At least that is my understanding.

At the start I wore the chin straps 24/7 except when eating, brushing teeth or showering.  As the month went by I wore it less, eventually only at night and stopped wearing it after four weeks.  They give you a detailed schedule to follow.

I had FFS with Facialteam 6 weeks ago today. Every part of your description above resonated with me and was so familiar. I didn&#39;t discover this post until today and while there are things I could have known before going by having read it, I am strangely grateful for my experience being exactly as it was and with the girls who shared my journey there. My post-operative depression has been similarly intense, for many of the same reasons, as well as being underwhelmed by my result. Facialteam did excellent work. I am just not as lucky as most and they are surgeons, not wizards. I strongly encourage people proceeding with FFS to take onboard your advice regarding consultations. I felt after surgery that I had not made my wishes clear enough during my in-person consultation. I even felt too embarrassed to discuss &#34;pretty&#34; beyond feminine - I presume the product of years of indoctrination that wanting to be pretty is vanity. Ridiculous given the purpose for which I was there. I too went alone and it was an intensely emotional and at times traumatic experience but I cherish it among my life&#39;s richest experiences for exactly the liberating freedom of just being accepted that you described, and for the friendships I made there. Coming home was not the happy, victorious joy that I had envisaged before leaving. I didn&#39;t leave the house for almost a month, my self-confidence shattered. At 6 weeks some of the things I didn&#39;t like initially are starting to improve. I hope they continue to do so. Reading your reflections on healing after a year gives me some hope. Thank you for sharing. I feel strangely connected to you by this experience. Maybe one day I will have the pleasure of meeting you at a reunion :)
