I&#39;m posting my story here for two reasons: first, there are very few posts talking about transfeminine bottom surgery options around here that aren&#39;t one type or another of vaginoplasty (not that there&#39;s anything
<em>
at all
</em>
wrong with people taking abut their vaginoplasties!), and as someone who doesn&#39;t want one, it made it
<em>
really
</em>
hard to find a qualified surgeon and understand the process as a whole. Since I&#39;m now through the hard part of my odyssey, I figured it&#39;s the right thing to do to change that, so anyone else who&#39;s considering something like this doesn&#39;t have to struggle quite so much as I did to find the care that they need. I am currently one week post-surgery.
</p>
<p>
As a note, I&#39;m using an alt account and I&#39;m not supplying pictures for the same reason: I&#39;m a bit modest, and I work a public-facing job, and my main account has enough personal details associated with it that I&#39;m personally identifiable by name with enough legwork. If I&#39;m a little slow to respond, that&#39;s what&#39;s up; apologies in advance. To make up for the lack of pictures, I&#39;ll try to be extra descriptive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
My background
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a mid-30&#39;s binary trans woman. I hatched during the pandemic, and have been moving through my transition pretty rapidly, with great support from family and friends. I first recognized that I had bottom dysphoria in the winter of 2021, and was baffled by it because I had never had, and continue to not have, any mixed feelings
<em>
at all
</em>
about sex, sexual activity, or the use of my phallus. I worked extensively with my therapist to come to understand that my dysphoria was highly compartmentalized to my scrotum and testicles--in essence, I had presentational dysphoria from showing girl bulge, which was resolved through good tucking, and physical dysphoria from the sensation of my scrotum on my legs and crotch. Once I began to explore this and was able to separate my genitals into their two component pieces--the phallus and the scrotum--I began to experience gender euphoria from having and using my phallus. This made me confident that I wanted a scrotectomy and that that would fully resolve my bottom dysphoria.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Odyssey
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since scrotectomies are one of the least common bottom surgeries,
<strong>
very few
</strong>
providers are trained and willing to provide this service. I ended up calling over 200 urologists in an attempt to find one who was both willing and able to do so. The one main requirement I had was that the surgeon in question had to have done the procedure at least once before--since this was to be my final bottom configuration, I didn&#39;t want to be anyone&#39;s guinea pig. About a quarter of the urologists I called were able and trained in the technique, about an eighth had performed one before, but as soon as a provider learned that I was transgender, I was immediately refused care--once I was told &#34;come back when you have cancer and I&#39;ll do it.&#34; The justification every time was the same: every single doctor I talked to during this time was
<em>
certain
</em>
that I would eventually want a vaginoplasty, and scrotal tissue is, of course, precious for that procedure.
</p>
<p>
As you might imagine, this search took
<em>
months
</em>
, and included multiple failed attempts
<em>
at gender clinics
</em>
to receive care. I include it here only to note for people seeking this procedure that
<strong>
by far
</strong>
the hardest part of the entire process will be in finding a good doctor who is cooperative.
</p>
<p>
That said, it was through my carpet-bombing of every urologist I could find that I eventually found my surgeon: Dr. Nabeel Shakir.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Nabeel Shakir
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Nabeel Shakir is a
<em>
very
</em>
recent hire at Henry Ford Hospitals in Detroit, Michigan--and by this I mean that he started there in late September. He was trained in the NYU gender system, and was hired by Henry Ford Hospitals with the specific mandate of founding a top-quality, comprehensive GCS program there. In his time with the NYU system, he performed about a hundred vaginoplasties of various types, and had performed five scrotectomies independent of a vaginoplasty before me.
</p>
<p>
The first thing you need to know about Nabeel (he asked that I call him by his first name) is that
<em>
he cares
</em>
. Like,
<em>
a lot
</em>
. It oozes out of his pores, and in each of the pre-surgical consults I had with him, he spoke with deep compassion, immense knowledge, profound respect, and made sure to proactively ask about and to address any sources of dysphoria in a gentle manner. At no point do I feel he ever condescended to me, and at every point in the process I felt that he made me an equal partner in the design and provision of my own care. He provided me with his personal cell phone number, and asked to be made immediately aware
<em>
by it
</em>
if I had any questions, or if anyone in the hospital system treated me with anything less than perfect respect--in his words, &#34;I want to set this program up and do it right, and if I can&#39;t do it right, then I won&#39;t do it at all.&#34; I still used Henry Ford Hospitals&#39; MyChart for the few non-urgent questions I had for him, and at one point he responded using it within 30 seconds of my messaging him.
</p>
<p>
I have never had as easy a decision to work with a doctor as with Nabeel. I cried from joy, relief, and validation at every pre-surgical consult I had with him.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Pre-Surgical Process
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I first contacted Henry Ford Hospitals Urology in late August, and after a little shuffling in September, was told about Nabeel&#39;s hire, and was scheduled to meet him. Nabeel and I met for an intake video consultation in early October; I believe that I am one of his first surgical patients at Henry Ford. We discussed my needs in detail, he talked about his qualifications, and fielded questions earnestly.
</p>
<p>
A week after my intake, my surgery was scheduled for November 17.
</p>
<p>
I had a second, in-person consultation with Nabeel on October 22. We discussed surgical techniques, using a reference image from Dr. Bowers&#39; portfolio, so we could explore what I needed from the surgery. He then performed a physical inspection to ensure that I had enough tissue to achieve my goals; this inspection was quick, gentle, and was prefaced with a discussion of dysphoria triggers so that he would be able to avoid as many as possible. After the inspection, we talked some about the program he&#39;s setting up at Henry Ford--I&#39;ll add general information about the program in a comment to this post, as it may be of interest to others.
</p>
<p>
The one real hiccup I had in the process is that, Henry Ford Hospital being a large practice, the surgical scheduling department did not get me my pre-surgical paperwork until November 16, when I really ought to have had it the week before. This really doesn&#39;t reflect on Dr. Shakir&#39;s office, though--any large hospital is going to have these sorts of errors from time to time. It didn&#39;t affect my surgery in any way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Day of Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My wife came with me to surgery, and Henry Ford&#39;s surgical waiting lounge was large and comfortable. She was given an identification number to follow my progress, and was promised a call 30 minutes into surgery, then every two hours thereafter (which wouldn&#39;t happen, because my surgical timeline was 90 minutes).
</p>
<p>
I was brought back to be prepped for surgery, and the nurses there were
<em>
excellent
</em>
. Henry Ford is a magnate hospital, and it shows in the quality of their nursing staff, who were kind, gentle, and in all respects lovely. Nabeel came back to talk to me and do some paperwork, and then went out to the surgical lounge to talk to my wife, to give her his cell phone number, and make sure she felt confident as well. Later, a second urologist came by, because Nabeel was training him, as I understand it, on the surgical technique for a scrotectomy, so he was a listed attending physician for the surgery as well, and would be performing the orchiectomy portion of the operation. Once I was prepped, my wife was brought back into the prep area and we waited together. The surgery before me ran over, and things started 40 minutes late; again, very normal for a hospital as large as Henry Ford Detroit.
</p>
<p>
Nabeel used a hybrid surgical technique which used part of a straight-line scrotectomy incision and the so-called &#34;batman&#34; technique. The result of this is a long straight incision to the base of my phallus, then a Y-split which wraps around it. Since my priority in this surgery was snug skin through the crotch with as little extra tissue as possible, and a full and uninterrupted penile sheath, Nabeel decided to try this out.
</p>
<p>
I spent a long time in the recovery room, I suspect because I was given a heavy dose of anesthesia; it took me about four hours after surgery to become cogent. This is probably because I lost a little weight after my October in-person consult and, again, really doesn&#39;t reflect poorly on anyone; anesthesia is trickily specific. During my time there, my attending nurse misgendered me. My wife alerted Nabeel, who alerted the nurse&#39;s supervisor, and the nurse did not do so again--and, just as importantly, didn&#39;t cop an attitude about it either.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the quality of my care on the day of surgery was top-notch. I have no complaints.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery: Week 1
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The day after surgery I was still processing the overload of anesthesia, and struggled to eat and emotionally with monsters dredged up from my subconscious. This is normal for me. The morning after that, the last remnants of anesthesia cleared from my system and I started to be able to recognize how I physically felt, which was wonderful.
</p>
<p>
Pain in recovery has been minimal; it&#39;s been entirely controlled with 500mg Tylenol and 200mg Motrin. They sent me home with some narcotics for emergencies, and I haven&#39;t touched the stuff. The recovery so far has been really easy--lots of rest, obviously, but really no meaningful pain. I&#39;ve had scrapes that hurt more than this. The incision is healing very well, and skin over about 2/3 of the total incision has already knit together. The hardest part of recovery so far has been getting replacement steri-strips to stick.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Summary
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Shakir and Henry Ford Hospital have been
<em>
amazing
</em>
at every step of the process, and getting my dysphoria pouch removed has been liberating in ways I lack the words to describe. I would unhesitatingly recommend both in the strongest possible terms to anyone seeking bottom surgery, and particularly a scrotectomy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit: Recovery: Week 6
</strong>
</p>
<p>
It has now been six weeks of recovery, which means I&#39;m finished with the official recovery period. My recovery was a snap, physically--the suture healed extremely well, for the most part (more on that in a moment), with barely any scarring on most of the incision. I was completely off of painkillers by the two-week mark, and back to most of my normal activity by the three-week mark.
</p>
<p>
The one complication I&#39;ve had is that at the join of the Y suture incision, I had some skin separation, and that is just finishing healing now. This was not unexpected--Y incisions often do this, and I specifically requested snug and smooth skin down there, so the join was a locus of some tension. It hasn&#39;t hurt as it&#39;s healed, and really has just required a little bit of extended wound care.
</p>
<p>
In this period, Nabeel has been in regular contact with me via text to monitor things--and by this I mean that
<em>
he
</em>
has been reaching out to
<em>
me
</em>
to check in. The man texted me on Christmas morning to check up, for goodness sake!
</p>
<p>
My functionality down there is excellent, and it behaves exactly as I prefer. Sensation is 10/10--and, honestly, maybe even better than it was before.
</p>
<p>
In total, I cannot recommend Nabeel Shakir in high enough terms. He&#39;s the doctor you hope to stumble across in gender affirming care, but never really
<em>
expect
</em>
to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit: 4 months post-op
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been fully-recovered for a while now, and I&#39;m still absolutely pleased as punch with the results of my surgery. To be honest, it&#39;s so good, such a relief, that I struggle to even remember what it was like to have something like that down there between my legs. It&#39;s just... right.
</p>
<p>
If I had a criticism in all of this, its that the Y suture has left a bit of a snug point at the base of my penis, because I&#39;ve got scar tissue extending three ways and coming to a join. It&#39;s not really much of a problem, but I can get a bit of pain if I stretch it up all the way, and occasionally during sex there just isn&#39;t as much leeway as I&#39;d like. It&#39;s a small margin we&#39;re talking about here--maybe an eighth of an inch of difference in how much skin is there and there&#39;s be no issue at all. It&#39;s not really a bother, but it&#39;s not perfect.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when I mentioned this offhandedly at a followup appointment with Dr. Shakir, he took a keen interest and looped in a colleague. Long story short, next month I&#39;ve got a meeting with the two of them so we can look at things in a little more detail with a few more tools to see what we can do nonsurgically to free up that eighth of an inch.
</p>
<p>
My recommendation of Dr. Shakir remains unconditional.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit: 12 months post-op
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The tightness issue has been fully resolved. I have the best genitals in the world. Dr. Shakir is awesome. The end.

I had vaginoplasty at NYU with Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Shakir was the first person on her team that I met during my consult and physical exam. My surgery was performed recently, so after he left NYU, but I can definitely confirm what you said about his personality and bedside manner. At first, I was confused and put off by how genuine he seemed, but after talking with him for a few minutes I realized that his genuine care for his patients is authentic. Really looking forward to see where he is able to take the program :)

A note about the GCS program under construction at Henry Ford Hospitals:
</p>
<p>
Dr. Shakir is currently hiring and training personnel to begin providing vulvoplasties and vaginoplasties at HFH-Detroit. He says things are going well, and is expecting that within the next 6-12 months that that part of the program will be fully up and running. One item of note that stuck out to me is that Dr. Shakir is hiring a specialty plastic surgeon to finish his surgeries after he&#39;s done the mechanical work, so that his patients will not only have the vaginas or vulvas they need, but that those surgeries will result in vaginas and vulvas that look the way that patients want. He says he wants to keep revision rates as low as possible, and make sure that revision, when they are needed, are resolved effectively. Nobody likes a chain of surgical recoveries.
</p>
<p>
Henry Ford Hospitals is currently recruiting a microsurgical specialist to start providing phalloplasties. Since this process takes time as well, and because that surgery will involve its own training process for support staff. As with vagino- and vulvoplasties, Dr. Shakir can do most of the major mechanical work, and can do (it sounds like) almost all revision phalloplasty work, but there are components of the process which rely on micro vascular expertise, and he wants a specialist. For these reasons, Dr. Shakir is guessing that it&#39;ll be 1-2 years before HFH is able to provide phalloplasties.
</p>
<p>
HFH is working on getting gender-affirming hysterectomies set up in the near future. While Dr. Shakir is trained in the procedure, he&#39;s not allowed to do it at HFH because it&#39;s not a urological technique. It sounds like some of the gynecologists at HFH are great at things, though, and should be able to provide this service soon.

i know this post is old but im doing some research for my gf. idk if youll see this or if you even check this alt anymore but its worth a shot i guess.
</p>
<p>
did he take insurance? and if so do you mind sharing how much the cost was after insurance (if it was covered) or how much it was without?
</p>
<p>
did he require any letters of support?

I&#39;m on BCBS, and I paid not a red cent for anything. As far as I&#39;m aware, Henry Ford Hospitals is in network for all national insurance companies, so you should be good to go. Scrotectomy is considered a subset of GCS, and covering GCS is required by Section 1557 of Obamacare, so unless she&#39;s on a fully self-funded insurance plan, your girlfriend should be fully covered.
</p>
<p>
HFHS runs on WPATH criteria for all gender affirming surgery, so two letters. They didn&#39;t give me a lick of trouble with either letter.
</p>
<p>
If you have other questions, feel free to keep asking or DM. I keep up on this alt specifically because there&#39;s so little discussion about scrotectomy in the transfem community, despite the statistics that say that a lot of us do not and will never want vaginas. I think we need to be more open about this option--compare how low profile it is to penis-preserving vaginoplasty, which has its whole subreddit!

My first letter came from my regular therapist. The second came from a second gender therapist. We met once to go over my information, and then a second time to go over the letter and make any tweaks I needed.
</p>
<p>
Pretty much the least painful part of the whole process, tbh.
