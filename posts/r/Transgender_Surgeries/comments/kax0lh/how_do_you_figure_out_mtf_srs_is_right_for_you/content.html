Obviously it&#39;s easy to know if you get like constant and painful dysphoria from down there. But for me, while I do get consistent dysphoria there, it&#39;s more along the lines of a bit annoying and uncomfortable, but overall something I could cope with. SRS is an incredibly invasive surgery for obvious reasons and I want a good decisive reason for getting a vagina, which I don&#39;t feel like I have yet. I&#39;ve spoken to a few friends that got it and they said it was kind of a &#34;leap of faith.&#34; In that they werent really sure how much theyd benefit but just went into it, did it, and came out content. But that sounds really scary. Or is it accurate? How did you come to the conclusion that you needed SRS, how long ago was it, and did you make the right call?

I had no choice - I&#39;m Canadian, so Brassard was the only surgeon covered by my health care. I cannot afford SRS on my own. Just as well, because I&#39;m super happy with his work, and he enjoys a pretty good reputation.
</p>
<p>
There was no question that I wanted the &#34;SRS with cavity&#34; option. I like men; I&#39;m really looking forward to PIV sex. After five months, I feel like I&#39;m starting to get to the point that I might be able to withstand the friction.

These are my personal experiences.  I had SRS at the start of October, and I&#39;m still healing.  I have a whopping total of Zero orgasms post op.  Time will tell for me, but this was my thought process.
</p>

When I first started transitioning, I was indifferent to getting bottom surgery.  Sure, tucking was annoying, but I didn&#39;t think that was a big deal.  My Penis gave me some nice sensations, why get a major surgery?
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I drifted in and out of a few relationships.  At one point I was getting intimate with someone and I didn&#39;t want them to pay attention to my penis.  The idea of getting a blowjob, or fucking someone had no appeal to me even in the middle of sex.  I broke off a few different relationships because of that feeling.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
That was my &#34;Ah ha!&#34; moment.  If I could not enjoy sex with my genitals anymore why not get SRS?  In some regards, it was a bit of a &#34;leap of Faith&#34;.  I wasn&#39;t sure what the end results would be.  The only thing I knew for certain before surgery was I didn&#39;t enjoy my genitals any more, they had become a burden to my relationships.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I am still working on recovering.  I have  yet to really be able to enjoy my new Vagina, but I feel like I made the right decision for me.  Looking back,  I can&#39;t imagine ever wanting a penis again, but time will tell.

For me, I always knew I wanted it. I think part of that was realizing I was trans at 31, I&#39;d thought about having a vagina for a long time by then! I wouldn&#39;t call it a leap of faith, more like I knew it was something hard that I was going to have to do no matter what. No amount of worrying about it was going to make it easier, and there&#39;s not much I could do to prepare, I just had to accept that it was going to be hard and it was going to be worth it (it&#39;s absolutely worth it)

I think SRS is a lot like transition itself - since theres never going to be definitive proof you just have to take the leap of faith and trust it&#39;ll all work out in the end.

If you want a vagina enough to deal with recovery it&#39;s probably not a bad choice ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I knew I wanted a vagina very early in my transition. I&#39;m a month and a day post op and I&#39;m very happy. I&#39;m still recovering, but even now, it is so much better for me. It is a very personal thing and not for everyone, but for me, it was right.
