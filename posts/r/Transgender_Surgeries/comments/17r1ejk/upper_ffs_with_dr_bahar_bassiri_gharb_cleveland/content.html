What I had done: septorhinoplasty, frontal sinus setback with brow and orbital contouring (type III), brow lift, and hairline advancement. My septum was deviated and probably broken at least once in the past, so breathing has gotten a lot easier even though I&#39;m not done healing (my surgeon says about half her patients breathe better after rhinoplasty). I was hesitant to let anyone touch my nose, but her detailed functional examination convinced me that if I was going through all the trouble for FFS, it was worth trying to fix this thing up inside and out. I still kind of liked my old nose even with the hump, but the new one is clearly still
<em>
mine
</em>
, just put back the way it should have always been.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the stitches occasionally pulling or the nerves in my nose and forehead reconnecting one at a time, recovery has mostly just felt like a head cold. My whole lower face was one big bruise for a while, but most of the swelling has already subsided. At this point almost 2 weeks post-op, I&#39;m managing my pain with OTC meds and mostly just have ongoing swelling around my nose (which I have to tape up every day as you see in my last photo).
</p>
<p>
I still have to get my stitches out, and I&#39;m still wrapping my head up every night until then, but recovery has been much easier than I ever expected for over 8 hours on the operating table. I&#39;m going back for lower face work in the spring, but probably something a little more subtle than I&#39;d originally thought I wanted. Part of Dr. Bassiri&#39;s FFS research includes measuring skulls in the anthropology library like Dr. O used to do, so I&#39;m glad to agree with her that my facial proportions are already well balanced, but I&#39;d just like some rough edges cleaned up I guess. At this early stage I&#39;m already incredibly happy with how my new face is coming together, and I can honestly say that the biggest source of my dysphoria is gone! Nothing else I can get done (with the possible exception of VFS) would be such a drastic change in what I put out there to the world every day.

Fellow Clevelander here. Just popping in to say you look great through the healing, and I really appreciate the review of Dr. Gharb. Have always wondered if folks like her work.

Thank you! I&#39;m actually from Pittsburgh, but lately I&#39;ve been singing the praises of Cleveland surgeons! It&#39;s an 18-24 month wait for FFS at UPMC in Pittsburgh, but the entire process only took me about 6 months in Cleveland from first phone call to operating table. And besides that first night in the hospital (which I&#39;d have done anywhere), Cleveland is just close enough that I was able to spend my recovery time at home. My partner has to drive me another 2 hours each way to get my stitches out next week, but we can manage, and soon enough we&#39;ll be switching places there with the next few drives to Ohio being all about
<em>
her
</em>
care.

Just realized I babbled right past half your post, but do I like her work? I love it! Everyone who was telling me my nose didn&#39;t need anything now agrees the new one just looks cuter in every way and still totally natural looking (because it
<em>
is
</em>
mine, just fixed up a bit). And the forehead work is exactly what I was hoping for. Knocking back the anterior sinus wall in the middle is the &#34;simple&#34; part - aesthetically, my orbital area was my biggest concern and it came out
<em>
perfectly
</em>
. I hardly know what to do now with an eyeliner pen and all this open space on my formerly hooded eyelids. (no makeup in any of my photos btw)

I was waiting on them to call me to schedule a visit with her and this makes me even more excited. From what I can see your forehead and hairline already look absolutely beautiful. I&#39;d cry if I woke up and got to see that. I&#39;m very happy for you!
</p>
<p>
I have some questions about her in general if you don&#39;t mind me asking: What was it like consulting with her? How did you go about planning the surgery with her? What insurance does she accept, and did you have to pay out of pocket for the surgery? And how would you rate your pain 0-10? Guess that&#39;s all I can think off the top of my head.

I had Highmark BCBS with an employer funded plan that covered it all, and Anthem BCBS handled all the bills on the Ohio side of the border. Cleveland Clinic takes most insurance besides out of state Medicaid, here&#39;s a full list of providers they work with:
<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/patients/accepted-insurance" rel="nofollow">https://my.clevelandclinic.org/patients/accepted-insurance
</a>
</p>
<p>
The consult was great, by far the longest and most detailed consult of any of the three surgeons my wife and I have seen in the region. She took a bunch of measurements of my nose, the asymmetries in my cheeks and eyes, my 1.5 millimeter overbite (more than fine for what the orthodontist started with), etc. After that, they sent me to the photo studio down the hall for one of the techs to take my picture from a few different angles, and I went home with orders for blood tests and a CT scan of my head. After following up on that, we had another consult to talk about the results and what we&#39;d do with the way she likes to approach her cases, then I took a bit of time to make up my mind between her and the other surgeon I&#39;d consulted with (Dr Totonchi at Metrohealth across town, it was honestly a hard choice, I liked them both in different ways). I called back, set up one last consult for consent and scheduling, and a few weeks later we had a quick chat to go over the plan and set a surgery date. Dr Bassiri was great every step of the way and really put me at ease over some of my biggest fears.
</p>
<p>
Out of pocket: $0 because we&#39;d already hit our limit for the year, but my stage 2 next year will be $3k minus every other medical bill I accumulate between January 1st and then. That&#39;s just our insurance plan&#39;s limit - at least this part of planning gets a little simpler when you know you&#39;re just gonna max out for the year. Whatever they wind up charging I can put on a payment plan, at least it&#39;s 0% interest if you set something up and don&#39;t get sent to collections. The consult was $600 billed to insurance and cost me $150 out of pocket - that&#39;s steep but it included the professional photo shoot and artist services to sketch up my proposed nose and forehead before the second consult. I guess that&#39;s fair as these things go, and the old-school &#34;virtual FFS&#34; done with tracing paper and pencil was a nice touch.
</p>
<p>
Pain: 2-4, mostly the bottom end. Dull aches and pressure for the most part, sensation in my forehead is slowly coming back this week, and I&#39;m getting some brief pangs all over my forehead and inside my nose as things reconnect. I&#39;d braced myself for a lot more, but I&#39;ve felt worse than this. The aches and pains are more than a fair price for looking in the mirror and feeling the way I do now

Assuring, detailed, and caring every step of the way is everything a surgeon should be. Thank you for sharing. She is certainly an asset to the trans community along with the other amazing care she provides!

wow she did a great job I had FFS from dr spiegel in Boston but he did a horrible job I have scares and I still get misgenderd.  after my FFS surgery that I had with him I looked like a guy that just got out of a bar fight. so I have been living like this for about 6 years and  I can&#39;t afford to pay out of my pocket any more to get the other procedures that I still need and revisions done from my last surgery from dr. spiegel. so I have spent almost 5 years try to get a surgeons to take my medicare insurance but so far I can&#39;t find any surgeon that will take it. do you know if your FFS surgeon would take my medicare? if I can finally get FFS procedures and revisions done it would change my life it would be a dream after trying to find a good surgeon that I can trust to do my FFS. thank you.

Like I said, here&#39;s the clinic&#39;s insurance policy/accepted providers:
<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/patients/accepted-insurance" rel="nofollow">https://my.clevelandclinic.org/patients/accepted-insurance
</a>
<br>
Medicare or Medicaid is a huge difference; with medicaid, you&#39;re stuck within state lines where you have coverage with only emergency or special exceptions, but with Medicare you usually have more options, as long as the provider you&#39;re seeing takes whatever private assistance plan you might have to go along with it.

Apparently Spiegal runs a teaching business and his students operate on patients.

I went to a teaching hospital too, and I know I had residents working on me, but my surgeon was hands-on every step of the way and didn&#39;t let any of the junior surgeons in the room do anything she didn&#39;t already know they were capable of. Done right, many of the best surgeons do their best work while teaching, because they&#39;re explaining every step along the way. Where I draw the line with surgeons like Spiegel is where they won&#39;t give you a straight answer on who&#39;s doing what or where they seem to be running more than one operating table at a time (not completely sure and I know that&#39;s a very serious allegation in places, but based on his practice these days I&#39;m not sure how he could operate on all those patients himself even if he wanted to).

well what dr. spiegel did to my face it ruined the last 6 years of my life. after he took the bandaging off of my face a week after my FFS I was in shock and I cried I looked like a guy that just got out of a bar fight. it was horrible I didn&#39;t look feminine at all my hairline was so high and scared that I had to either wear a wig or hat. I have been trying to fined a good surgeon that would take my insurance it&#39;s been over six years since he did my FFS and I still can&#39;t find a FFS surgeon that will take my insurance. I don&#39;t know if anyone knows of a good FFS surgeon that I can trust that would take my medicare insurance. I spent all of the money that I had when I had my FFS with Dr spiegel.
