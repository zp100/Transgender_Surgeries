Hi! I had a partial FFS with FacialTeam about 4 years ago where forehead work was done through the coronal incision type. It left a scar (usually not visible unless I have my hair a certain way and hair dressers notice it) and I was at a consultation with them last year about it and they offered to help me with it. They said they could reclose the incision again or that I could use FUE-hair transplants to cover it. I&#39;m leaning more towards reclosing it as of now (together with a minor FUSS-strip hair transplant), but a risk with it is that the scar might re-appear. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Any advice on what approach is most suitable?

I had the whole package done with FT in 2020 summer. I lost all my hair around the coronal incision, it was a very visible bald patch going across my head. (I know you mentioned scar, not sure if it refers to the same thing, but this is what happened with me regarding hair loss.) I was offered the same solutions: either hair transplants, or re-closing it. I had a consultation with both surgeons, and after some consideration I opted to go with the latter.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon reopening the scar told me that this time it will be a non invasive surgery, with much lesser trauma. He didn&#39;t guarantee me perfect results, but told me chances of things improving were very high, and if even afterwards things weren&#39;t as good as they were supposed to be, I could still get hair transplant, covering lesser areas, thus making it cheaper and easier.
</p>
<p>
The hair transplant team on the other hand told me that their approach was the only sensible one, since recovery would very likely be just the exact same, so reopening made no sense, I would just end up with the same bald patch anyways.
</p>
<p>
I must admit I didn&#39;t spend too much time debating between these two, the argument for recovery being the same made very little sense to me, given the entirely different nature of operation, anaesthesia time, and so on. I understood that it might still be that I will require additional work, but I decided to take that risk.
</p>
<p>
The price difference was also a huge factor: 5k euros for the hair transplant, while 0 euros for the retouch +1k hospital fees.
</p>
<p>
I am now 8 months post revision surgery, my coronal incision healed
<strong>
perfectly
</strong>
this time, and it is impossible to even tell I ever had any issues around the incision.
</p>
<p>
It is my uneducated and somewhat biased opinion that opening the scar and closing it again was the much better option that I could go for.

Great to hear that it healed perfectly for you this time!
</p>
<p>
Reclosing the incision does seem like the natural choice, especially since it&#39;s about a smaller strip of tissue to be removed this time (less pressure on skin when reclosing than before, and apparently my skin is very elastic according to one of the doctors at FT, not sure if that might be related to the scar problem I got as a result of skin stretching).

Could you please make an update on this after you&#39;ve completed it. It&#39;s rarely discussed and I&#39;m sure it would help others in the future.

This is very interesting because I had a consultation with facial team and I asked about hair loss both permanent and temporary. And the doctor, a very very young doctor told me that this was ridiculous and this would not happen and had not happened to any of their patients. From that moment I knew I shouldn&#39;t go with them because I&#39;ve also seen here that there are many results that end and huge scarring and hair loss

Hi I’m waiting to get my coronal incision redone as it has gone huge, I feel like Frankenstein and it’s began to make me feel extremely depressed, I was just wondering if you had any luck after getting a revision?
