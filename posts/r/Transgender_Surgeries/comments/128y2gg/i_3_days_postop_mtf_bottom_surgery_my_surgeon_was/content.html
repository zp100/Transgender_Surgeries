It’s probably been the most painful experience of my life. However, Dr. Hanna and his care team have gone above and beyond to make the experience as positive and comfortable as it can be.

I&#39;m glad to hear that your care team is going above and beyond. I will be seeing the same surgeon later this month. I hope the pain becomes controllable soon!

Oh wow. I’m so excited for you. The entire process with him has been a dream come true. He was also super intentional about making my wife feel like part of the care team. Are you seeing him for a consult or your actual surgery date?

I was nervous too! Are you bringing someone?  The nurses are going to let you guide your pain meds, within obvious limits. Don’t be afraid to advocate or have the person with you advocate for meds. Also, make sure to keep your catheter line straight and without kinks!

I have a consultation with him in May and possible surgery date in July or August. I’m so excited but scared at the same time. I picked Dr. Hanna just from seeing some pictures of results that were posted on here and after speaking with the care team on the phone, I was sold on him. I’m going to be watching this thread for updates of your progress so good luck and hope you have a easier time in the next few days.

I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. The consult with him is what sold my wife and I on traveling from the Northeast to Texas for this procedure.

His results were all I needed to see. Absolutely stunning work on everyone who was kind enough to post their results on here. I was actually not going to do bottom surgery but seeing his work made me change my mind.

As far as how I saw results from his work, a few of his patients have posted pictures of their results from his work. I just happen to come across their post in the surgery post. Just look for post with Dr. Hanna and look for yourself.

We must have just passed each other. I am 18 days.  I am so happy with my results.  Did you get full depth or shallow? His team is fantastic.  I&#39;m so happy for you.  Hope your recovery is as smooth and as comfortable as possible.

We have been here since last Saturday. Everything has been perfect, from his staff down to the hotels that he contracts with. Today is my first day back at the hotel.
</p>
<p>
I’m still in a fair amount of pain, and am a bit scared about making the pain medicine last till I fly home. I also haven’t pooped yet and he has scared me away from trying. Lol I got a full depth. What did you get? How was your follow-up?

I got full depth. The follow-up went much easier then I feared. The packing and drains came out quite easily.  Do be careful to protect the stitches especially between your girl bits and the back door. That&#39;s were I have had some issues, but it&#39;s healing. I have started getting little zings from nerves waking up but nothing bad just enough to get my attention.  If you have a long flight, definitely use your doughnut.
<br>
Dilating has not been bad at all just feel pressure. Kind of feel like I need to go #2. When it&#39;s in far enough.

Is slight red/brown discharge when dilating normal at this point? It doesn&#39;t smell like poop, so I am not too concerned about a fistula.

That&#39;s probably still not unusual.  Osounds like old blood. Old blood, many times, will appear brown.
</p>
<p>
If it is a fistula, there would most likely be a fecal odor.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still best to check with the experts. I encourage you to email or call Hannah&#39;s office just to be sure.
</p>
<p>
Are you having any pain while dilating?  I know that dilating is a new thing and comes with a learning curve to what&#39;s the new &#34;normal&#34; sensations.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so happy for you. I know it&#39;s absolutely the best thing I ever did for myself.  Hope you&#39;re feeling just as euphoric and relieved to be complete, as I am.

I’ve taken pictures of the discharge on the dilators and I plan to ask my doctor about it this week. I also need to ask about some slight burning that happens when I pee. It smells but not like fecal matter.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is just awkward and uncomfortable in general, not so much in the way of painful. I feel gross in general but I’m hoping that goes away as I heal.
</p>
<p>
I’m still really satisfied with the results so far and what it has done to blast away dysphoria. I was also woefully under prepared with how tired the process of healing would make me and how mentally draining it would be. I’m hoping it as I heal, I get comfortable with myself, and things become more functional , I will be even more happy

I think you will. Recover is just as much mental as it is physical.  That&#39;s for almost all surgeries.  Post surgical depression is so common.  Feel free to message me if I can help. Happy to lend an ear and shoulder if you need sister.

OH, I suggest you see your D.C. soon, as some spinal work is likely to help speed the healing process. Acupuncture could help too. Maybe I&#39;ll add something. When you have a major injury (or surgery), the back will frequently respond with subluxation (what some Chiro&#39;s and Osteopaths call a &#34;somatic dysfunction&#34;). It&#39;s not unlike a thrown circuit-breaker (or blown fuse) in your home...and until it&#39;s corrected, things in the area &#34;fed&#34; by that part of the spinal cord will be &#34;out of whack.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m speaking as both a physician and patient. Three years ago, after an accident, I suffered from complete urinary retention (and loss of sexual function) (and MASSIVE pain!!). My urologist wanted me in the OR immediately. I held off, telling him I wanted to try something. Doing what I suggested above, I was much better after about five weeks, and recovered COMPLETELY after about six months. I&#39;ve been on HRT for two years now...and am about to get my chest augmentation. Dunno if I&#39;m gonna do the GRS.  BEST wishes, Girl!!
</p>
<p>
Oh, ONE more THING: Kegel exercises are easily done...and can be very helpful.

Try not to be too afread to poop. Do be careful cleaning yourself.  I caught a string from my packing. But noticed it before pulling more than an inch or 2 out. There is a lot of packing. Oh take a pad with you to the follow-up or disposable undies. You will have discharge. Not crazy like bleeding over but enough you will want to protect you clothes.

He offers rates at 3 different hotels that are right next to each other. We opted to stay at the Residence Inn and our total stay is 9 nights for around 1300 USD. We are really happy with the Residence Inn staff and facilities.

Did your insurance cover your FFS?

Yes it does. My company has a self funded insurance plan that is administered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield so my company actually makes the final decision on what to cover and what not to. I have spoken to the Human Resources Department and they told me that anything that I have letters from mental health professionals saying it’s medically necessary for my mental health, they will cover so I’m going for everything I can get out of them.

Hey, I hope your doing well and things are getting better every day for you. I have a question for you about any suggestions on what type of supplies I should get together for post op care at the hotel once I leave the hospital. Such as stuff you didn’t think about until you realized you needed it. Padding, cotton balls, KY, towels, wipes or whatever. If you could make a kit of things you used or needed, I would be grateful for the list of things I’ll need to have with me so my caregivers wouldn’t have to be leaving to go to the store. Thanks

Help, I have called and left messages with Dr. Hanna&#39;s clinic as no one answers the phone and unfortunately no one has bothered to return call from my left message request?  Any help greatly appreciated.  Welcome to DM if you prefer.

You must have the wrong number, they have always answered my calls on the third or fourth ring.

Hi!! I have a consultation with Dr. Hanna on Monday of next week. I am very excited but a little concerned about him having trained under Dr. Rumer but I also understand he did some studying overseas. I&#39;m nervous about just the consultation. I&#39;ve lost 120 lbs since last July and my BMI is 34.7 at 5&#39;11&#34; . I&#39;m nervous he will shut me down and not let me set a surgery date.
</p>
<p>
If he&#39;ll let me set one I know I&#39;ll get down to at least 220 lbs before the surgery. I&#39;m taking Mounjaro for my diabetes (its like Ozempic but better) and it makes eating less super easy. My sugar is perfect. It&#39;s basically impossible to not reach my goal weight eventually. I don&#39;t know if you are heavier or not, if so did he mention BMI requirements?
</p>
<p>
I just learned this last week that my insurance covers both SRS and top surgery. I&#39;m also interested in top surgery but that can wait a while.
</p>
<p>
What made you decide to go with him? How long did the whole surgery process take from intake to going home? I&#39;m trying to determine if I have enough PTO or not.

Dude trained with Rumer.  I can see the horrible technique anywhere.

I’m quite happy with my experience and I’m sure I’ll be happy with the outcome, whether I need a revision or not. It was the best healthcare experience of my life.
