Your doses may be adjusted but you wonâ€™t stop taking them.

After srs for mtf, you will need to be on estrogen for the rest of your life. Your body no longer is able to make any hormones. You will not need testosterone blockers anymore as the organ that makes testosterone has been removed.

You are wrong, testosterone is also produced by the adrenal glands.
</p>
<p>
So you can&#39;t completely stop producing it.
</p>
<p>
The body needs testosterone, whether you have surgery or not.
</p>
<p>
It is also produced by the female body.

Yeah, that is true, forgot to include that, but it isn&#39;t enough to create masculinizing effects. It&#39;s only at a level of 10-15 pg/ml. Thanks for the correction!

Also you&#39;ll have testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in circulation for a while post op. It doesn&#39;t all get magically metabolized the moment the surgeon snips the vessels. My endo suggested continuing my antiandrogen (bica) for a few months after the operation. He said to gradually decrease the days until my dosage was down to none.

After srs you should expect to take on an intensive regimen of photosynthesis. At least 30min of direct sunlight daily. If you don&#39;t live somewhere sunny, be sure to purchase a UV emitting lamp as part of your post operative treatment. /s
</p>
<p>
But really, if you needed them this long, where do you think hormones are going to come from? Many people maintain the same dose, but your doctor may have you lower your dosage. Continue to work with a physician and have blood work done to track your levels to ensure they&#39;re in an acceptable range.

Didn&#39;t have to stop E2. Stopped spiro. And taken off P4 for the time being.
</p>
<p>
After a lab test after SRS got prescribed T as it was gone completely. E2 dose didn&#39;t change initially, but now being revised towards an increase and moving to injections as my E2 levels are plummeting. Living without sex hormones is awful. Dr. tells me that in rare cases hormones after SRS may have massive shifts and I&#39;m one of those cases. If injections don&#39;t work, likely will be taken off E2 and possibly moving to T monotherapy with detransitioning.  I&#39;d rather be dead than doing that tbh.

Some doctors suggest lower E after surgery but I found my sex drive and motivation dropped off when I tried so I ended up going back to my old dose anyway.
