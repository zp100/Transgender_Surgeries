I had a ffs consultation with Dr. Zukowski who is in Illinois. During the consult I asked a lot of questions and he turned me away because I asked too many questions.
</p>
<p>
Some of the questions I asked since it is a private clinic and I was nervous about any issues that come up during such a long surgery were
</p>
<p>
&#34;what if there is an emergency&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;what if my heart stops&#34;
</p>
<p>
&#34;what if there is some complication where I need to be admitted to hospital&#34;
</p>
<p>
I felt he thought I was asking too many questions about the surgery itself. I asked these same questions to every other surgeon during consults and no one really had any issues
</p>
<p>
But after reading all the stories about this surgeon including ones where he tried to sue his patients??
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad he turned me away.

I went to his clinic for my first large volume electrolysis (meaning my whole face) about four years ago.  I never went back.  I am getting my electrolysis elsewhere.  He presented me a proposal for FFS.  I went elsewhere.  I do not regret it.

I understand I went through that with my experience at the other surgeon and thought I would never make it, it takes you to a low point that is hard to come back from, it really changes you. I talked with some girls and they were never able to make it out of the darkness sadly. I&#39;m glad you were able to make it and hopefully no one ever has to experience that.

I had FFS with Zukowski and was pleased with the result.
<br>
My best transgender friend is also a happy former Zukowski&#39;s patient.
<br>
In my personal case : I had a very masculine face. A first surgeon in Europe took a lot of my money and did a shy FFS that just didn&#39;t feminize my face. After the surgery, I still didn&#39;t pass. I was constantly misgendered ans even insulted in the street.
<br>
Then Zukowski took care of me. After 8 h of hard work, he gave me a feminine face. I could finally socialize as a woman and started attracting guys.

I have an absolute horror story working with him. I had his 7 hour electrolosis session done and during the procedure he stroked my inner thigh and told me I had pretty eyes under twilight anesthesia. At around hour 6 I asked to stop being injected in the face with lidocane as it was incredibly painful and he disregarded my request and ordered the nurse to do it anyway. The nurse replied &#34;Doctor... I cant do this without consent&#34; he took the needle and did it himself.

He fondled me during the breast exam for my BA consult with him. I’ve heard quite a few other stories like ours about him too. He’s a disgusting man, terrible surgeon, and I hate him.

Thanks for sharing. I’ve been through electrolysis with him three times and haven’t been a fan of him. The staff is ok. I have one more session and then I’m coming it quits with him.

Yeah, it&#39;s really too bad there are so few options for mass clearing sessions. I really feel like it can have a massive impact on mental health and dysphoria for some folks including myself.

It was a huuuuuuge help for me. I’ve done laser and hour long electrolysis sessions. Neither were effective for me.

I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s illegal, and its definitely unethical. Have you filed a complaint anywhere? How are you supposed to trust him to do surgery?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll add this to the wiki.

I haven&#39;t... I tried to just move on and advise my community to stay away and focus on my transition. I guess the process seemed like another hurdle and I don&#39;t have the funds or time to deal with being sued by him. I realize thats probably the chilling effect he&#39;s after but yeah...

I went to his clinic for lidocaine / mass clearing electrolysis and had a full blown panic attack while drugged up because..something just felt off.  It felt so informal in this way that had me feeling pretty paranoid and he would just walk up and stick lidocaine in my face without announcing what he was doing while I had goggle over my eyes.
</p>
<p>
While I was there he tried to sell me repeatedly on all the surgeries he can do.  It all felt so weird and quasi legal and all my red flags around men were triggered and blaring.
</p>
<p>
Like nothing off happened but it also was nothing like what a normal doctors office visit is like for a procedure.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I have to go back because there are no other mass electrolysis centers on the east coast and I&#39;m sick of burning all the commute time doing it piecemeal but like wow, I wish there was somewhere else.
