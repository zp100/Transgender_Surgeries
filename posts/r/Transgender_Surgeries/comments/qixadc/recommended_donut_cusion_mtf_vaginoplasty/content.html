Hello everyone,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen &#34;donut&#34; cushions recommended before, to relieve pressure on the sutures (MtF Vaginoplasty). So far I&#39;ve seen two styles:
</p>
<p>
The classic inflatable donut:

</a>
</p>
<p>
A wedge shape with a hole in the back:
<a href="https://seniorlife.se/sittdyna-med-hal.html">https://seniorlife.se/sittdyna-med-hal.html
</a>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also seen variants that are either inflatable, or are made with memoryfoam.
</p>
<p>
Can anybody recommend which kind worked best for them? Is memoryfoam going to be better than inflatable?
</p>

In my virtual pre-surgery (edit:) education webinar - for vaginoplasty surgery at NYU with Dr. Bluebond-Langner, I was told not to buy/bring/use an inflatable donut ring or anything of the sort. I was told the hospital would provide a waffle/eggshell pad for me to use. The explanation was the hole on the middle of the inflatable allows/exerts too much downward pressure on the surgery area, where the pad they provide maintains even support and relieves pressure across the buttocks and the vulva.

Will respond here for visibility since I cannot edit my original post.
</p>
<p>
I talked with my surgeon, and like yours I was told they&#39;ll provide a cushion; no need to get one myself.
</p>
<p>
So, it&#39;s interesting how the prevailing knowledge is to get one when the surgery team providing one seems to be the more popular experience! (judging by upvotes here)

That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told but to me the square seats were sooo uncomfortable. I ended up throwing mine away, the air would shoot out that I felt like I was sitting on a thin layer blanket. I&#39;m in search for a new one. I saw some girls bought their own seat post op. You&#39;ll only see rbl one time maybe two times if you&#39;re lucky.

I used an inflatable rubber donut cushion and it worked well for me because it was adjustable by inflating/deflating til it was just right, plus when it got dirty it was easy to clean. Throughout the recovery process, I adjusted the cushion as needed.
</p>
<p>
If you have any allergies, keep the material that the cushion is made of in mind, as the last thing you want during recovery is an allergic reaction across that entire area.

I used one like this:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MXNFBMK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MXNFBMK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
</a>
</p>
<p>
It worked well.  It was firmer and I didn&#39;t have to worry about it shifting oddly.  I just kept pressure from being applied to my surgical site.

Oh interesting! I&#39;ve heard nothing about supplies being provided (I&#39;ve got Gunnar Kratz / Link√∂ping, they gave me a packet 2 years ago but it said nothing about supplies ... I&#39;ll shoot a question over to them to ask...)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be at home for the most part, and I don&#39;t have a car (usually bike or bus everywhere) so my hubby will do shopping etc...But I guess if I&#39;m laying on the couch with a few pillows I&#39;ll be okay...
</p>
<p>
Either way, thanks, I&#39;ll look for something thick (and probably not so compressible) with a wide hole

I had surgery with Gunnar three weeks ago. I was given a ring cushion to take home. Shaped like a toilet seat actually.
</p>
<p>
Not sure what the other supplies that were mentioned on the deleted comment, but I also got the dilators. They gave me a small bottle of lube too, so I&#39;ve been buying the water based one by RFSU since and it works great for me (order it online, though, for some reason in costs almost twice buying it in person, even with the same pharmacy).

Came back to give that update, haha! Just got a response, they said the same thing. Congrats on your surgery! I hope you are healing well.
</p>
<p>
Sounds like you got a small bottle, which is probably why they recommended getting some anyway. You mean this one?

</a>
</p>
<p>
They also recommended getting Ibuprofin/paracetamol and wash pads. And would give me more info in a phone call the week before surgery? Haha, coordinating timelines has been a challenge, I&#39;m thankful my employer has been patient...
</p>
<p>
Could I PM you? Or I could throw more questions here...Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! I&#39;ve been challenged to find more info on experiences with him, here or on the Nordic one. I&#39;ve seen pictures from

Yes, that&#39;s the one.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s alright if you want to PM or ask here as you prefer. If you check my profile, yesterday I commented on another post here with some more advise.
</p>
<p>
Paracetamol has been useful for a few days. It&#39;s possible you may need to take it for longer.
</p>
<p>
They will call you a couple days before you go in, yes. It might be good to write down things you want to ask them.
