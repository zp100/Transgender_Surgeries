I had a glottoplasty with him, not the FemLar. If you see him in person, he will be very upfront with you that there is no guarantee with surgery. This is true whether you get a glottoplasty or anything. FemLar is much, much more dramatic and, I believe, feminizing than a glottoplasty is and if it does not work “enough” I don’t think you could do a glottoplasty later. On the other hand, I have heard many, many more failed glottoplasties and he told me he’s had to do FemLar on a number of people who previously had vocal webbing. Pitch is just one aspect of voice, and for some people just having a higher voice is not enough to make you sound feminine. I recommend checking out YouTube for people who have had a glottoplasty and were not happy with it; when you get away from the high profile websites that market the procedure, you will find the results can be great or they can be negligible.
</p>
<p>
I always tell people, I chose Dr. Thomas because he was honest. He told me upfront that I would probably get a good result but there were no guarantees and he played me examples of results that were great and some that did not turn out well at all due to complications. There aren’t many surgeons out there that will share poor results on their website, and I felt like I could trust somebody who would be that upfront. I had a combination of a web glottoplasty and laser vocal tuning. I would rate my results as good. If I could do it all over again, I would probably just have done the FemLar. I have lost weight since then, and while I did not have a visible Adam’s apple before I do now. I’m going back to see Dr. Thomas in a few weeks to see what can be done about that because I don’t trust anyone else to remove it out of fear of damaging my vocal surgery results.

Once you have surgery, you schedule all the follow ups in the office and it’s much easier to get that kind of stuff booked. I had to have a revision done because I developed a granuloma, and we just booked that at my follow up appointment. I’m going to be having another possible one done here in a few weeks but it’s not an emergency or anything so we just did that over the phone. He gives you his cell phone number after surgery so you can call if there’s an emergency or something. My revision was minor and done in the office under local anesthetic via a little laser.
</p>
<p>
One thing I want to emphasize is that I don’t think there’s any surgery anywhere where you can just never think about it and go “well, all the work is done for me.” The surgery completely took away all of my deep voice and there’s no chance of me ever again slipping and using the male tones or dropping my voice or shouting like I did, and my voice is certainly much higher and softer. However, no matter what you do you still need to think about inflection and choice of words and even the contents of what you say. Before surgery I was told I sounded like a woman who had smoked too much, but sometimes my voice would really drop and I was deeply disappointed when I heard recordings of my voice before surgery. After surgery I sometimes think my voice is still too low sometimes, but I do really well on the phone and no longer get misgendered and I don’t ever have to worry about “slipping” because I can’t.

It really, really is. I keep some old videos handy so when I ever feel bad or think surgery didn’t do “enough” I can pull them out and get a listen to what I sounded like before when I let my guard down and wasn’t even trying. Knowing I can never, ever sound like that ever again even if I tried to makes it all worth it. It really did get rid of a huge amount of the old male range.

Well, I think some people have unrealistic expectations. I saw somebody on here bashing him horribly after they had complications. Well, that does suck, but he tells you AHEAD OF TIME (as do all surgeons) that that is a risk. It doesn’t mean anyone was “botched” but no surgery even in the best hands always gives the results we want. He even has examples of complications on his website so there’s no way anybody can say we aren’t making an informed decision going into it. Another person insisted their surgery failed, they still sounded just like a man, it was a huge con and a rip off, etc. but when they finally posted before and after samples the change was massive and literally everybody thought they sounded cis. It was clearly a case of vocal BDD or something where they would never be happy no matter what and could never hear themselves as they actually were. I think the unhappy people would have been unhappy no matter who they went to, and probably even more unhappy had they gone to somebody less qualified.

There is also a HUGE problem with people carelessly tossing around the term “botched,” that’s for certain, and it’s incredibly frustrating. Every single complication from even the best surgeon gets labeled “botched” in here as though surgery is magic, this despite the fact that we all are told ahead of time and sign papers acknowledging that surgery may not result in perfection and that even the best doctor can’t promise an infection or a keloid won’t occur. And then, when Dr. X does a perfect penile inversion but the patient develops a wound separation due to unknown factors a week later, or somebody doesn’t like their nose two weeks after surgery even though healing takes a full year, everybody starts screaming that Dr. X “botched” it. It makes it very hard to weed out the genuine cases of genuine bad doctors, and believe me, they are out there.

Honestly I wish I was prepared to have 2 revisions... Too many people have voice revisions after Femlar and I still think it is because he does sometimes the surgery wrong. I had an awful result. Then I had co2 laser and it helped a lot but my voice is still very disappointing. I will try to have corticosteroids or steroid injections if the residual inflammation is the problem. After that if it steroids don&#39;t help and if ktp laser are indicated I will have one session.
</p>
<p>
And if it doesn&#39;t help I will go to a surgeon who performs glottopoasty to have a revision.
</p>
<p>
I just hope he didn&#39;t damage my larynx.

Well, my “revision” (I’ve had one so far) was due to a granuloma that formed on my vocal cord due to the healing process. I sounded good after I healed originally but then developed a rasp, so we did one season of KTP in the office under local anesthetic. I had to rest my voice for a few days but it was nothing like the original surgery. I don’t think my issues had anything to do with him doing anything wrong, at least in my case, and I had glottoplasty and not FemLar. Any time you put stitches into your body you risk a granuloma. The KTP totally resolved it and has kept me stable for years but after a bad bout of Covid I seen to be having issues with hoarseness again. I’m headed back to the office for the lovely “camera up the nose” to see if I’m having another one after being sick or if it’s unrelated. If the scope shows another polyp it’s likely they will zap it in the same way. I think it’s been 2 years since the last one. It’s not accurate at all to portray my experience as endless, invasive revisions when I’ve one in the office that took maybe 30 minutes and which totally fixed me. Until I get scope it’s not 100% sure that my current issue is related.
</p>
<p>
If the FemLar surgically shortened your vocal cords I just don’t know if you will find anyone willing to shorten them even more by webbing then. I can’t recall if you posted a before/after clip or not but I do hope it works out for you:

Yes dr Yung is doing revisions from femlar patients... Dr Thomas said he did an error of measure and didn&#39;t remove enough thickness so my voice was extremely hoarse and deep after the surgery but I don&#39;t know what really happened  Now my voice is very inconsistent, and not clear.  Thank you

Just be prepared to potentially NEED co2 laser révision (3800 dollars) or ktp laser sessions, or co2 laser révision and after that one or two ktp laser tune up revisions...

Yes we have 2 Ktp sessions for  free yes but not the co2 laser  And honestly I don&#39;t think even though it is a  stronger laser, that co2 is always better I chosed co2 because I lived far away and we have to wait 3 months between each ktp session

Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that you will get the desired pitch elevation with glottoplasty either. There are plenty of cases of people who have had vocal webbing who’ve had the full webbing and had either minimal results or also had serious complications. It’s very unlikely you’d get your money back in that case; if you then wanted to purse FemLar you’d not only need to raise the money all over again you’d probably need to find a new doctor to do it. Glottoplasty isn’t a magical, guaranteed result while FemLar a dangerous crapshoot: they both have their risks and while it’s true that FemLar is probably higher risk its probably more stable long term and addresses issues like resonance and the Adam’s Apple that the glottoplasty does not.
</p>
<p>
Personally, if I were you I’d wait and do nothing for a while. You can always have surgery later but you can’t take it back and I don’t think planning on multiple surgeries is necessarily practical. This may be your only chance to have FemLar with Dr. Thomas and I, personally, would take it. If you do cancel and have a glottoplasty elsewhere you will still risk complications and a result you aren’t happy with. Having said that, it does seem that you’re far from making up your mind and random Internet advice isn’t a good way to do so. I’d take more time go take think about it before you make a permanent decision that can’t be undone.

No he raised the prices of 3000. It was 12 500, now it is 15 500

<p>
Yes florida prices are crazy expensive I didn&#39;t know Galina was his wife (I called their office in November) She forgot to answer one of my email...
</p>
<p>
I need to save a lot of money too I want some other procedures such as hairline lowering (if possible after a coronal incision) hair transplants to feminize my hairline shape and lower my hairline, also the coronal incision raised it... zygomatic reduction, jaw reduction, maybe forehead and nose revision with Deschamps, and maybe fat grafting to the cheeks..
</p>
<p>
Maybe bbl to the hips only
</p>
<p>
Necklift to get rid of my huge sagging chin skin if HIFU doesn&#39;t help :(

I don&#39;t know how hard it is to get money back, did you write to Estelle or Jonica?

I had FemLar with him recently. My voice is still well within the recovery period and doesn&#39;t sound anything like what I want yet. but in a few weeks or maybe a little longer I should have a better idea of the final results. My experience with him has been good so far.
</p>
<p>
My impression is that if you are in your 20&#39;s or 30&#39;s and have voice trained, you will greatly increase your chances of good results. My starting comfortable pitch was around 150Hz. Having a higher starting pitch also seems to help.
</p>
<p>
I plan on posting more when I can start to hear my final results more. I hope that helps.

I struggled with voice training, so I&#39;m there with you in that I want VFS to do the bigger part of the work. I have noticed a change in my resonance which is great. That&#39;s the part I struggled with the most and why I chose FemLar. Dr Thomas even commented that I had a larger than normal larynx. I&#39;m still waiting for it to finish healing so I can hear the final results. I am optimistic.

Good luck! It’s a big deal and it’s rough not being able to talk. I recommend making some very, very candid “before” recordings so you can remember how far you’ve come because it’s easy to forget afterwards. I stocked up on notebooks for writing and a lot of non-irritating beverages and such for dry mouth after.

I notice you have been posting in an anti-trans hate sub. You&#39;d be better off posting in

I had FemLar with him in 2020 (and a minor KTP laser adjustment a year later). I’m generally really happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Here are some recordings I’ve done over the past few years of my voice progress / changes. It really takes about a year to hear final results.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer questions.

At 24 min 57 you can hear that she has a féminine voice and had a very deep voice before surgery
