Oh my god. That is so beautiful I could only hope for that outcome.  What are your favorite things about it? How does it feel just walking around with it?

Thank you so much ðŸ§š. To be honest, the vaginoplasty operation saved my life. The dysphoria was very strong, since the operation it&#39;s as if it had always been there.

How does everything feel? When did it stop being sore on the inside?

I feel superb ðŸ™‚, thank you. At the beginning, it was really complicated. I had urinary infection after urinary infection for 4 months where I had to sit on a buoy. I was in pain for about 8 months. The pain subsequently subsided. When I had vaginoplasty, I thought I was asexual and that my vagina wouldn&#39;t serve me. It took me 1 year after the operation for me to understand that I could have pleasure and I haven&#39;t gotten tired of it since.

It looks really good!  Which type of surgery did you get? Inversion, PPV, colon? What is your care regimen? Dilation, douching, etc?

Thank you ðŸ™‚. The vaginoplasty was performed by penile inversion. During the first 3 months I was advised to do 4 dilations per day and to disinfect the virginal cavity immediately afterwards with iso betadine. The 4th month 3 dilations per day. The 5th and 6th month, 2 dilations per day. After the 6th month until the 1 year of the operation, 1 dilation per day. After 1 year, 1 dilation per week. Being a lesbian, I had a lot of trouble doing the dilations every day, I was tired of being penetrated by a piece of plastic. I no longer followed the recommendations after 6 months post-operatively and I only lost a small centimeter deep in the virginal cavity.

Absolutely follow your inter. The dilation regimen is a guideline. Given ur preferences and leaving depth for your own discretion, what about clitoral development and responses? Share with us if you want Terrific look in total by the way

Iâ€™m going to go to the Genk with the gender team (stupid idea to be forced to see the gender team btw)... Iâ€™m so scared, to be honest.
