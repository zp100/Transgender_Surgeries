I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been only 4 months. It feels like forever.
</p>
<p>
Last month everything calmed down down there. The swelling has gone down and everything&#39;s healed up. I still don&#39;t have depth and due to pain from there being a sort of ring in my vagina I stopped dilating until I get my revision. I didn&#39;t have much left anyways. Everything else is functional, I can pee fine, orgasm, and everything down there is sensitive.
</p>
<p>
I talked with Gallagher and I&#39;m going to be getting my revision in October-December provided Covid doesn&#39;t completely lock everything down again by that time. That should keep me from having to deal with any more hospital fees and she isn&#39;t charging me for the revision.

At least she&#39;s still communicating with you. That&#39;s a good sign. Now don&#39;t get mad at me, you know how I feel about Gallagher. I even understand why you would return if she isn&#39;t charging you anything. Lucky you! With that said, I&#39;m curious what the revision entails? You said everything healed up, but you don&#39;t have any depth and you haven&#39;t been dilating due to pain.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like the revision is going to involve creating an entirely new vaginal canal. Is that the plan? Essentially you&#39;ll have to go through all the healing and recovery again. Given that scenario, what do you think will happen differently this time to increase your chances for a good outcome?
</p>
<p>
BTW -Congrats on your ability to urinate.

Sorry for taking so long to reply I didn&#39;t see this until now.
</p>
<p>
I have about an inch to 2 inches of depth at most. The hole isn&#39;t completely gone despite me not dilating, it&#39;s just not enough to actually dilate. I have to hold it in or it instantly falls out basically.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s going to remake the vaginal canal, first by going through the normal way and if there&#39;s scarred tissue going in through the back (another stomach incision) to make it. She won&#39;t be pulling peritoneal tissue again so she&#39;s just going to try to pull back what was there originally. There won&#39;t be a robot involved most likely so no extra pain.
</p>
<p>
She also talked about removing some of the extra skin from the clitoris and working on making the labia more like labia than what they are now. I have a lot of extra material so it&#39;s reasonable that&#39;s why it looks the way it looks.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s definitely going to be different is I&#39;m going to be able to move around and do things after this surgery. I won&#39;t be under as long as the first one and it&#39;s not going to go as far and be as invasive as the first one so not as much pain hopefully. I&#39;ll also not be stuck in a hotel afterwards so I&#39;ll be able to rest better and I have more experience with dilating and what could happen. I&#39;m also not going to be dealing with a breakup in the middle of healing so I&#39;ll be in a way better mental state.
