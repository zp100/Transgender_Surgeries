Dr. Mosser has such an impersonal and complicated process before ever getting a consult that he&#39;s just not worth it

And they don&#39;t respond to emails asking for clarification.  No way I would trust my body to a team that treats people like the DMV.

I used to go there for HRT. They had the worst operations and overall experience, though I liked my doctor.

I was not thrilled with my experience with Dr. Mosser’s team AT ALL.  He’s a nice enough guy, himself, but his team was very non-responsive and inept when it came to follow through.  They boasted about having an “insurance concierge” that would handle all the pre-auth stuff for you... but they totally didn’t.  Dropped the ball and didn’t help whatsoever when it was denied.  I had to handle that all myself and they cost me a year of delays and stress.

Yep.  I&#39;ve only received automated emails like all I&#39;m worth is spam.  A human has yet to contact me.
</p>
<p>
That won&#39;t cut it when I get call backs from all the other office&#39;s before noon.

When buying something expensive I always go in with the expectation that the sales process will represent the best service they have to offer, and the after sales support is going to be worse.
</p>
<p>
Got to wonder how they will treat you if/when you have complications.
