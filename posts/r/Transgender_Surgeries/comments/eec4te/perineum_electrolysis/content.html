So I&#39;ve seen a few surgeons recommend electrolysis around the perineum before SRS, I&#39;m just wondering where specifically they mean by this? I know where and what the perineum is, just that as an area that seems a bit vague as to how much I&#39;m doing there and what to ask for at the clinic/centre. Also for anyone who&#39;s had that done, how long did it take and odd question, but what kind of position are you in for it? Got my partner joking that you&#39;re on your back with your knees to your chest.

My surgeons require electrolosis prior to surgery because they don&#39;t scrape hair follicles off the inside.  IIRC it&#39;s because the scraping technique also scrapes off nerve endings.  Their goal is sensation inside the canal post op.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t do electrolosis (laser isn&#39;t permanent), and your surgeon doesn&#39;t scrape, you&#39;ll have hair growing inside your canal that is impossible to remove after the fact.
</p>
<p>
Attached is a diagram they gave me to show to my electrologist.

Typically it takes 9 months to a year to go through 4 full clearings.  You lay on your back for most of it up top, and spread your legs with your knees pointing outwards for the perenium.  They call it &#34;the frog position&#34;.

I hear the face is the most painful place.  I managed to get a norco prescription and use that along with two different creams for my downstairs.
</p>
<p>
I said this in a different post, but to me it seems like the biggest influence on amount of pain is the experience of the tech.  My first technician had &lt;1 year of experience and it was excrutiating, even with norco.  My new tech has 20+ year experience and I could probably fall asleep on the table if I wanted to
</p>
<p>
Another determining factor on pain is method.  To me, thermolosis hurts waaaaaay more than light-thermo blend or straight galvanic electrolosis, but YMMV.
</p>
<p>
If nothing else works, I hear some girls go to their dentists and get a novicaine shot just before the session, and that always works from what I hear.
</p>
<p>
Stay strong!  Let me know what ends up working!

I may depend on the cream.

Who is your surgeon? I’d like to add this to the wiki.

Aw cool!  My surgeons are Melissa Poh (plastic surgeon), and Polina Reyblat/Amanda Chi (urologists).  I&#39;m told the urologists do the dissection, and Dr. Poh does the reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;re the Kaiser SoCal team that was put together a couple years ago.  I&#39;ve been having trouble finding any photos of their results online, and they won&#39;t show me any because of internal patient privacy policies.  If anyone&#39;s had surgery with them, please tell me how it went.

I have Northern California kaiser and I was able to see pictures of three SRS photos in a slideshow they do for a class to teach us about SRS. I would ask about that

I mean if availability is an issue, then yes laser is better than nothing.  But I believe I&#39;m correct in saying that electrolosis is universally accepted as being the better hair removal technique.

I have a really chill electrolysist and she basically just leans over my splayed leg and puts her face right in there. I would say she is by far the exception than the rule though (i didnt even have to show her where to work, she already knew since she has a ton of trans patients)

The perineum is the area between the scrotum and the anus, and between the thighs. I had both laser and electrolysis there. For the electrolysis, I had to pull one knee to my chest and the other leg was abducted like in a frog leg position. It wasn’t comfortable to hold that position for an hour, but that’s what my surgeon wanted. Also, how long it takes depends on how much hair you have. I had 12 laser sessions to the Brazilian area and then another 3-4 hours to the same area (that includes the shaft and scrotum) so for me it was a rather extensive process

Here&#39;s a diagram:

</a>
</p>
<p>
As for positions, I&#39;m just on my back the whole time for the electrolysis, legs a bit spread out. For the laser down there though I did sometimes have to not lift my legs up or anything, but stick my knee out to the side with my foot kinda against my other knee to give better access.

I think it&#39;s YMMV on needing it. Mine favors using some perineum inclusion to increase ability to self-lubricate
