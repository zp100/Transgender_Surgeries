hello, i&#39;ve been dealing with some granulation tissue and while i&#39;ve made some progress on it i have some questions. i&#39;ve included a picture for reference.
</p>
<p>
when i showed my surgeon a few weeks ago they said to scrape away at it and it should be fine which i&#39;ve had success with but he&#39;s been non responsive the past few weeks understandably with covid and stuff.
</p>
<p>
one of avanessians patients has had some success with clobetasol cream as a preventative so im trying to get that to help with it, the shippping time is really slow, about a month, should i still try to get it?
</p>
<p>
Is there anything i can do if that doesnt work? Is there supposed to be skin below the clit or is it also granulation tissue? &#34;i&#39;m assuming it is, it&#39;s the redness&#34; Ive scraped away at it a bit and didn&#39;t for a few days and it looked like both sides were beginning to fuse?
</p>
<p>
Will it go away on its own if i leave it all alone? i want to get this taken care of already. it&#39;s the only issue i&#39;ve had with surgery and i want it to be over with.
</p>

Granulation can heal by itself eventually, but not always. I think I’d try to avoid treating it where it’s not causing a problem in the hope it goes away. Maybe up to a year.
</p>
<p>
I’d try to avoid treating near clit or urethra. With clit it could damage sensation and it’s possible for urethra to heal closed, which is bad... If you do make sure it’s someone who you can trust to do a good job.

You’re 3 months post op with Ting?

I was prescribed betnovate ointment from my GP which healed the granulation tissue. Maybe you could ask your GP if that would work?

Hey! I know it’s been over a year! Did your granulation go away? If so how/ when?
