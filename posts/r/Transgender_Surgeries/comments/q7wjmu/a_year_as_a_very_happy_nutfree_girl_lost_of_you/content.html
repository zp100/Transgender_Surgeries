Thank you for your article. As I am currently being tested for prostate cancer, and orchidectomy is one of the possible treatment methods, this was a lot of the information I was searching for in the event I have to make that decision ahead of schedule. It&#39;s the sort of information that the medical people don&#39;t tell you.
</p>
<p>
While it may be as far as I end up going, it does have promise as a procedure that could be a stepping stone to either vulvaplasty or vaginoplasty.

You could get the orchi, keep the skin and if you wanted a vagina there wouldnâ€™t be any problem sis.

The only problem is it turns into two separate surgeries :/ Iâ€™m scheduling a consultation soon to talk about all of my options(: I could get a PI vaginoplasty with  1.5years at Mass General in Boston, but I canâ€™t find ANY reviews or photos of people who went there?? I know itâ€™s relatively recent, so I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m comfy with going there :/

Even though it&#39;s two separate surgeries, orchiectomy itself is a very simple outpatient procedure with healing time ~1 week, and because you can get it from any urologist, wait times are only 1-2 months.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, you could get your orchi done as part of your vaginoplasty, making it 1 procedure.

A couple years ago I called four local urologists in a big city and they all refused to do an elective orchi. Just because they can doesn&#39;t mean they will ðŸ˜‹

How does it feel to be nutless? I think I&#39;m probably gonna end up going all the way but I did think about an orchi before.

Not OP but itâ€™s really nice not worrying about T somehow masculinizing you further. Plus tucking is effortless and I donâ€™t really have to think about it. Iâ€™m getting full SRS next year, and the orchi gave me some comfort in the meantime as I save up money.

Sweet. Though I don&#39;t think I have to worry about T masculinizing me but I understand that if something were to happen and you had to stop taking HRT then you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about T doing anything

Wow what a great journal - thank you so much for posting this. So informative and well written. I am now considering this as an option. I have a ZDV scheduled for January, and I&#39;ll need to do some more thought about the results I&#39;m expecting. My clinic (Align Surgical in San Fran) also offers the &#34;Futa&#34; penile-retention vaginoplasty, so decisions decisions ðŸ¤”

Also - I never knew what a Rafe was. Thanks for that!

Hi! Post orchi 4 years here, and just want to say I feel very much the same about...all of it! After reading the end of your article, I wanted to make sure you know that penile preserving vaginoplasty is a thing. It was unclear from the article if you knew that or not. In the US there are a few surgeons who do them. Not sure about anywhere else. â™¥
