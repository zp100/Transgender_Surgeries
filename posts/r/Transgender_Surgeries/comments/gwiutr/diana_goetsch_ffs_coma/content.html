Two sides to every story and hopefully the other one isnt as dramatic and sensationalised as this. Don&#39;t believe everything you read....

Below is a more recent reddit post regarding this experience (in support of another victim of van de Ven). I also refer to the thread in the FB FFS group, where I get quite specific and factual, and where van de Ven attempted to counter me (then stopped, when I kept posting photos of his handiwork). Please beware of this surgeon.
</p>
<p>

<p>
I’m Diana Goetsch, the person who wound up in a coma for eight days after being operated on by van de Ven on February 13, 2016. You can read a factual account of my ordeal, with photos, in the Facebook FFS group. That ordeal includes this surgeon’s numerous aesthetic mistakes, nerve damage, damage to my sinus cavity, and attempts to financially bully and manipulate me. To call this a botched surgery would be an understatement, and I&#39;m lucky to have escaped with my life. (I also reported the coma experience, though not the medical specifics—many of which I had yet to realize—in
<em>
The American Scholar
</em>
:
<a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/coma/%22%20%5Cl%20%22.XzQMUhNKjaY" rel="nofollow">https://theamericanscholar.org/coma/#.XzQMUhNKjaY</a>
)
</p>
<p>
What I’d like to say here is that tone and words matter. The way a surgeon characterizes his work, and characterizes you as a patient, after a botched or sub-standard procedure, can bully, gaslight, and further traumatize. (I too have “5 star” nerve damage.)
</p>
<p>
Van de Ven actually tried to blame me for the coma, claiming I had an “unknown blood disorder” that caused my neck to swell with blood, and not his incision. This was later proven false (and laughed at) by hematologists in the U.S. Van de Ven also wanted credit for “saving my life,” he who continued operating for hours (instead of saving my life) after observing my neck swelling with blood.
</p>
<p>
Also, let’s beware of “flying monkeys”—the surrogates that surgeons send out to swarm and attack any patient who dares to report a negative experience. When a trans woman posts photos, and gives a factual account of her experience with a surgeon—positive or negative—she is informing and protecting our community, and we owe her a debt of gratitude. Flying monkeys who attack, criticize, or mitigate the experiences of trans women are traitors to our community.
</p>
<p>
Hear me: There is never a reason to attack or criticize a report of a medical experience, positive or negative. No surgeon’s livelihood is more important than our LIVES.

That&#39;s horrible. Is there some kind of governing body of medical people you can report him to? He needs to not be practicing medicine of any kind anymore.

Diana was his patient. She says it is him on a FB thread and he replied without denying he caused this. He even had to pay her 10k hospital bill.
