Rashid, Bellringer, ... ?

I would not go into surgery with the same surgeon to attempt the &#34;easy fix&#34; again (3rd time). Instead I would first write a formal complaint, because yet another surgery with the same surgeon does not guarantee to &#34;easy fix&#34; the problem the surgeon was unable to fix, and instead just raise your complication score (potentially one surgery away from complications or worse outcome).
</p>
<p>
I would hope that through the complaints procedure up to the ombudsman, to get approval to seek revision with another surgeon eg in Europe, Germany eg Schaff (who prefer two stage method), which the NHS pays for. And not being ping ponged for yet another failed &#34;easy fix&#34; between the two NHS surgeons (no international patient pays privately for their skills &amp; outcome).
</p>
<p>
Edit: Ok, from another comment the surgery history is Thomas, Bellringer, Inglefield. I really recommend to write a formal complaint and to the ombudsman, and seek a consultation with a surgeon team which does two stage (eg. German Schaff, Morath)

<p>
The Technique
</p>
<p>
As said before, the technique carried out in this hospital is one of a kind. For the vulva, Schaff and Morath mostly work along the lines of Suporn and Chettawutt, thus using penile skin for the labia minora and pudendal cleft, and using the inner part of the foreskin to create a sensitive clitorial hood. However, they use the (homogue) scrotal tissue for the labia majora, instead of penile skin (as Suporn does). The urethra is sewed into the front part of the vaginal wall, which for the other part consists out of a non-meshed, hair-free scrotal skin graft. This means Schaff and Morath do not perform a penile-inversion technique, what they offer is their own unique take on Suporn&#39;s method. Other than the aesthetics, another benefit with their technique not being PI, is that there&#39;s much less tension on the penile skin, thus benefiting bloodflow and reducing the need of complications. Also, there&#39;s no need to construct a mons veneris afterwards.
</p>
<p>
And it shows! The results they produce are spectacular, visually and functionally on-par with the top Thai surgeons and fully lubricating with arousal, because the urethra is included into the vaginal wall. They urethra has lots of glands in them, called LittrÃ©&#39;s glands. These normally prepare the urethra for the coming ejaculation, lubricating it. With the urethra being placed in the vaginal wall, it keeps the vagina naturally clean and lubricated, providing enough moisture or penetrative sex. On top of that, Schaff and Morath also keep the Cowper&#39;s glands, which exit into the vulva, as their homologues do in cis-women. This means full natural lubrication while aroused, both inside and out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Schaff and Morath operate in two steps, they do this mainly to leave excess skin in the first go so they can allow for more swelling without damaging anything.
</strong>
The second step mostly revolves around your own personal wishes, it can involve a labiaplasty, clitoroplasty
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Swelling is always bad post-op for the healing process, because it can lead to ripped sutures and wound dehiscence (wound seperation), which quiet often gets posted here. Which makes the scarring worse.

I was trying to make the case for surgeon teams that actively practice two-stage surgery techniques, compared to NHS just one &#39;attempt&#39;[1], when looking for a surgeon team for your 4th revision surgery to remove erectile tissue.
</p>
<p>
See the
<a href="https://www.lubos-kliniken.de/fachbereiche/transgenderzentrum/mann-zu-frau/einzelschritte-der-op/" rel="nofollow">clinic website which mentions this about the 2nd stage surgery
</a>
, revision, where they remove any erectile tissue left or missed removing during the first stage operation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
2nd part of the gender reassignment surgery: Enlargement of the vaginal entrance Reconstruction of the pubic mound (mons pubis reconstruction) Application of a clitoral cap (preputium clitoridis) Correction of the large and small labia Possibly further corrections (e.g. removal of erectile tissue remnants, enlargement of the urethral opening)
</p>
<p>
[...]
</p>
<p>
More fixes
</p>
<p>
If problems have arisen by the time of the second part of the sex reassignment operation (e.g. narrowing of the urethral opening, excessively large and disturbing urethral cavernous remains, pronounced scarring), they can also be remedied during this second operation.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
[1] what is cut off is cut off, scars as is, mistakes or complications not corrected like scars from wound separation due to abnormal swelling or bleed clot, corrections are not planned for)

Basically its up to you ... if another surgery would not work and you would like to go out of pocket,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/wukrl6/continued_loss_of_depth/in14k9e/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
was a discussion about revisions.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise looking up a few things about leftover erectile tissue in the wiki to the right may also be a good idea. A number of people had revisions.
