I had GCS two weeks ago. They told me they were able to give me 6” of depth. When they went to show me how to dilate though we couldn’t get anywhere near that depth. Just about to the first dot on the dilators. The surgeon said my vaginal canal could be really swollen. It’s now been a week of me dilating and there have been no changes. I’ve not been able to get any depth back. Has this happened to anyone else? Cause for panic?

I did end up getting around and inch more after a couple of months once the swelling went down. Keep up with dilation and be sure to apply firm but gentle pressure while the dilator is in.

Well that’s good news. They seemed surprised by how little depth I had when they went to teach me how to dilate. I’m dilating longer and more often than recommended and doing whatever I can to get some depth back.

Hmmm I would look into a pelvic floor physical therapist. Like ASAP.
</p>
<p>
It could be a swelling issue, or it could be the muscles impeding you, wheather its by not relaxing or how your body is positioned.
</p>
<p>
Assuming it&#39;s mostly swelling, a pelvic floor physical therapist will help prevent you from developing bad habits that could lead to actual depth loss while things settle.

I was with the pelvic floor physical therapist learning how to dilate when we discovered my depth wasn’t what it should have been.

Oh well I&#39;m glad to hear you had one of those right away. Not all doctors express how important it is.
</p>
<p>
You may be fine as it&#39;s highly unlikely you&#39;d lose like 2 inches that fast even if you decided  otherwise to dilate at all.
