hi everyone :) im korean so i went to korea for my FFS.. they&#39;re known to be very aggressive. ive had ffs 3yrs ago and i keep having issue with insane pain below my chin. i remember the dr asking me if i want to have a v-pointed chin and that there could be some issues etc. but he never mentioned nerve damage. now since around 2years ive been to different doctors such as maxillofacial surgeons, ENT&#39;s, anestheologists, neurologists and now the shocker - ive been sent to a neurosurgeon and they basically diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia and said my only option would be neurosurgery and even then there could be other issues that are unpredictable, such as numbness, pain in other areas etc. i wanted to ask if any other girls have had such an issue and what they did?

Korean Vline surgery is extremely aggressive especially for western anatomy since their jaws tend to be bigger. More bone has to be cut off to achieve a small vline, risking cutting any nerves along with it .

i am korean, like fully korean haha. i just happened to be born &amp; live in germany. i wonder if the difference is, that biologically speaking, asian males have larger heads than biological females. and if that maybe could be the issue, since FFS =&gt; put everything into female ranges. aesthetically im very pleased with my result, but the nerve pain really makes me want to unalive myself. i struggle a lot day to day :(

well, i spoke to Dr. Park Jong Chul from the Wonjin Plastic Surgery Clinic (who should&#39;ve been my surgeon) but theres an issue with dr&#39;s sending in other less experienced ones to perform the surgery. i wonder if that happened...

omg oh wow i didnt even know all of this! but it doesnt help me knowing that others got botched, what i need to know is what to do with my pain. the trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis doesnt make any sense, since theres no nerve compression. and i cant keep living with this pain, its unbearable ðŸ˜£

I donâ€™t know the answer. I guess consult some other surgeons. Facial Team in Spain have free consults.

I am so sorry for the pain you are experiencing. Please reach out to Facialteam. They are on holiday until the 7th of January. I know they do revisions. Also, IM Gender Clinic in Barcelona. Cost is reasonable for FFS and structural changes. Calling them or emailing would not hurt to tey

My friend has trigeminal nerve pain, and there are medications she takes  that are very effective in keeping her pain-free.

the thing is, is that the trigeminal neuralgia diagnosis doesn&#39;t make any sense to me and couldnt even be explained by a professional! i told them that if theres no compression (2 MRI&#39;s have been done), how come that they say its trigeminal neuralgia? the neurologists couldnt answer me. i just feel like they gave up on me and want me to shut up or even worse, experiment.

It may not make sense, but your pain is real, and there are drugs now that can alleviate the pain. I had a coworker many years ago. Her mother had trigeminal nerve pain. This was well before the currently available medications, and she took her own life. I&#39;m glad you like your result. I can ask my friend for the name of her medication. It really has been a life-saver for her. I wish you all the best.

I had a long Messenger exchange with my friend. Iâ€™ll tell you what she said, but sheâ€™s also willing to chat with you on Facebook messenger. Send me a DM and Iâ€™ll send you her contact. My friend Susan said she was on gabapentib for a while, then they added oxcarbazepine. That worked for her for a few years, the side effects were weight gain and some dizziness. It also lowered her sodium, which became a problem for her. So then they put her on Vimpat, which was a newer drug used for seizures, and she said it really worked for her (she wrote that sentence using an exclamation point, so it must be good!) Vimpat (Lacosamide) dose for her is 150, twice a day. (The oxcarbazepine worked really well for her controlling her pain but the side effects affecting her sodium levels were too great for her. She was in her late 60s at the time.) She also recommends a Facebook page called End TN. Folks discuss treatments and results and support each other.

LISTEN!! You may have an answer...with Acupunture. I once had a cut (no, not a serious one but...) across my lips, which left my lips numb (and I was thinking how bad this&#39;d be if I played trumpet, say). A little Acu...and the sensation returned in a few days. I(t often helps with pain too!!)
