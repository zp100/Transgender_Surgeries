hii all wanted to post my results here because when I was choosing my surgeon I could only find 1 or 2 pics from Tina so I hope this helps anyone 🤍 I am an NHS patient and had my surgery on the 8th December 2021 with no complications
</p>
<p>
first of all I just want to say my surgeon did an amazing job I had doubts at my consultation but she is really really good I have been on testosterone blockers since I was 14 (now 20) and I barely developed down there so there wasn’t alot to work with but she did it anyways 🥰 I didn’t need hair removal and haven’t had any problems with that i’m really satisfied with the appearance/aesthetics even though its still swolen and healing I think it looks really pretty
</p>
<p>
My Recovery:
</p>
<p>
Recovery for me has been actually kind of easy the most pain I experienced was the first few days after surgery in the hospital I was in hell but it got easier and easier
</p>
<p>
After that I was taking ibuprofen and paracetamol the first 2 weeks being back home but now I dont need to take them anymore they dont really help me anymore just make me feel sick
</p>
<p>
I still have pain and its bad sometimes but I can handle it it’s mostly in my labia or my clitoris randomly starts hurting really bad for a while and then goes away
</p>
<p>
Dilating:
</p>
<p>
I’m having issues dilating because the purple dilator is just too big for me personally and it’s uncomfortable my vagina is really tight and it’s not adjusting to the purple it wont go all the way in (seen in the pictures)
</p>
<p>
I’ve ordered the P2 orange smaller dilator and it should be coming today or sooner this week
</p>
<p>
Other than that dilation isnt all that hard I was sick of it mentally the first 2 weeks back home but i’ve accepted that I have to do it mentally and just watch netflix while i’m doing it
</p>
<p>
It gets really uncomfortable the last 5 minutes sitting/lying up im bed with my head against my wall to keep me up but I haven’t really experienced any pain from dilating even when I did it in hospital 🤷🏻‍♀️
</p>
<p>
Depth:
</p>
<p>
I don’t think I got much depth from being underdeveloped i’m getting up to the 3rd dot on the purple dilator so i’m not sure with the smaller P2 orange one I hope i’m still able to get it in up to the 5th dot i’m not too stressed about it anyways since i’m with a girl not a guy
</p>
<p>
All that being said I really recommend Tina to anyone she did an amazing job and I have 0 complications 🤍

ah thank youu 😊
</p>
<p>
dilating is needed to keep the vaginal canal open when its healing so it wont close

<p>
it was probably my pics that you saw about Tina Rashid. I could only get up to the 3rd dot early on but over time as the swelling went down I was able to get the dilator further in.

Hello, you. Congratulations on what seems to have been a very successful surgery. I was also on puberty blockers from a very young age, and so I recognise how daunting it can be going into surgery with slightly different donor material to most.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery with Chettawut when I was 19, am am now 24. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have about the journey ahead for someone in a similar position

hi &amp; thank youu &lt;3
</p>
<p>
yeah i was worrying all the time about hair removal and not having enough skin i couldn’t tell if my surgeon was right about me not needing it since consultations are always rushed and there wasnt enough explanation i had a breakdown over it and everything i contacted them and got another appointment after that and my surgeon showed me why i didnt need it and explained everything and i was finally at peace and got my surgery date
</p>
<p>
when did the pain and bleeding finally stop for you?? im still going i hate wearing pads all day they are so uncomfy

i gave up about 2nd of jan coz no bleeding (3 weeks after surgery) seem to be more comfortable after ditching pads
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
i was lucky i got away with just using paracetamol and ibruprofen since day 1 took co-codamol a couple of times coz stitches was uncomfortable so i could sleep
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>

I think it&#39;s the taking blockers starting at 14! Still, it&#39;s kind of amazing.

I&#39;m at parkside next week. How bad was bad those first few days of pain. Did the morphine help when you had that. Also did they offer anything else to help control. My biggest concern about parkside and pain control. By way results look great.

thank youuu &lt;3

<p>
i won’t lie to you the pain the first few days was so bad i had a morphine pump that you can control yourself after surgery and i was using it all the time i ran out on day 2 or 3 from using it so much it really helped cause after it ran out i couldn’t use it anymore so the pain from then was horrible i was being given paracetamol and ibuprofen from then it didn’t really help me much the pain was still there but thats just me with you it could be totally different so don’t worry
</p>
<p>
i was given a really strong painkiller 2/3 times nothing was working on me i was also given sleeping pills cause it was so hard to get to sleep but again this is just me it will be different for you just don’t be afraid to ask the nurses

This seems to be a major difference between Bellringer and Tina. I was in absolute agony and the nurses just kept saying I couldn&#39;t have anything other than ibuprofen and paracetamol due to Bellringer instructions. I had to scream at one of the night nurses and they finally called the on call GP who prescribed sleeping pills... Better then nothing. It&#39;s making me really angry thinking about it REALLY FUC*+NG ANGRY. The fact that Tina let you have pain killers makes it even worse to know I was needlessly suffering.
</p>
<p>
Look at my previous posts for the details. Now I&#39;m bloody crying again. It&#39;s not effin right 😥
</p>
<p>
I swear it&#39;s proper messed me up, I can&#39;t deal with this

Hopefully those of us who are waiting for our turn learn from you. You’re not the only person I’ve seen who has said they only received those pain meds meant for mild to moderate pain. Sometimes I see it listed as a hospital policy, which may also be a good things to look into.
</p>
<p>
We need to ask the surgeon during our initial visit “what is your strategy to control pain post op ?” And if you don’t already know, “which hospital would my surgery and care be in?”
</p>
<p>
Then.
</p>
<p>
Go to that hospital. Ask for the patient experience department (it may be called something else, that’s what it’s called at the hospital I work at) and tell them you’re CONSIDERING having a surgery there. And that you would like to get a copy of their pain control policy. Also get their phone number so you can report any bad experiences. In my hospital there is a weekly meeting between patient experience and the CEO.
</p>
<p>
There’s an announcement once a week of both good and bad experiences to the nurse leaders. Departments are called out or congratulated depending if it’s a great experience or a bad one.
</p>
<p>
I can see a couple of outcomes
</p>
<p>
1) they refuse and won’t even discuss it. To me this is a no go. But obviously know that acetaminophen may be all you get.
</p>
<p>
2) they won’t give you a copy but will discuss. From here make your decisions on the information you receive.
</p>
<p>
3) you receive a copy. Again make your decision on your information. Consider bringing it with you. Picture on your phone may be useful.
</p>
<p>
Also Ask what can you do if you run into staff who won’t follow the policy.
</p>
<p>
Use the chain of command.
</p>
<p>
If the nurse won’t act. Ask for the charge nurse. If the charge won’t act, ask to see the nurse manager in the morning. When your provider comes tell them. Call the experience line. If they don’t have one, ask for the C suite (CEO, CFO CMO CNO…) chief medical officer chief nursing officer… make it known.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully someone is with you who can handle this for you,
</p>
<p>
But even more…hopefully the prep work prevents anyone else from having this experience.

Can you describe the kind of pain I should expect. Is it aching or thrombin or burning. That kind of thing?

I&#39;m at parkside next week. How bad was bad those first few days of pain. Did the morphine help when you had that. Also did they offer anything else to help control. My biggest concern about parkside and pain control. By way results look great.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Everyone&#39;s experience of pain afterwards is different. I had Tina Rashid at Parkside and hardly felt any pain. The way I reacted you wouldn&#39;t have known I had a major surgery. I was given the option of having Morphine which I could give myself by pressing a button if I needed it and was given pain killers every few hours.  Pain was never really an issue for me. I felt going to the dentist was worse than SRS

Wow looks really good !
</p>
<p>
I am amazed at how well your stitches have healed ! I&#39;m at 8 weeks and mine are still really red, using bio oil on them but it doesn&#39;t seem to be helping :(
</p>
<p>
Are you using anything on them?

I notice from your post history you’re posting in what’s basically a anti trans hate sub. It’s really messed some people up. Try this one instead

I’m just saying the sub is not what you think it is. Try other one. It was set up by trans people because of the problems with the one you’ve been visiting.

Reddit is a mix of good and bad, and some of it is very bad. The owners of the site don&#39;t care unless it makes them look bad in the mainstream media, and much of the time not even then. Try to watch out for yourself and be aware of the context of what you are seeing.

Yeah, I get that. It&#39;s a big decision, so everyone worries about choosing the wrong one.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting penile inversion in March so I was hoping to find some results to know what to expect. Honestly I&#39;ll be thrilled if mine turns out even remotely like this
