I am aware of the pain and swelling of the second week of surgery after the wound vac was removed. But I have a wound separation on my labia majora that is just so bad, all you can see is tissue, so raw and liquidy bloody thing oozing from it. It will never heal because urine passes on it whenever I pee. I literally scream whenever I pee. I need to drink a lot of water for healing but at the same time I dread peeing because I know the wound will get peed on. Itâ€™s like squeezing lemon juice on a raw wound or cut. I was told not to use cream or whatsoever on the area. I am in terrible pain and its not gonna get better because of the location of the wound separation. If there is just a way to stay dry I know it will heal but that is impossible because of its location.
</p>
<p>
I have been in communication with my surgeon on hale and I have been told that it is not an infection. She suggested that I see a therapist for my anxiety instead.
</p>
<p>
I will be really, really grateful if you can give me advise on how to deal with it. Again, please donâ€™t say talk to my doctor because I did and I do. She thinks itâ€™s all in my head. I can send you a picture of my surgical site only if youâ€™re not squeamish. I canâ€™t even stand looking at my own vagina, it terrifies me ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢

Hey, I had wound separation below my vaginal canal (perennial tear) and ran into a similar issue. My surgeon recommend using a douche or spray bottle to lightly rinse the area with saline to prevent infection and aid healing. I did this once a day just before bed and it helped a lot, it&#39;ll take a while to heal the area since a lot of your body&#39;s resources are already being used for healing the whole area. The pain with urinating will go away after a few days (mine was 3 days after the tear opened).

Thank you very much for this advice. It works like magic. I feel a lot better. The wound dehiscence seems to be responding well. I had a good night sleep and thereâ€™s minimal pain in the area. I can walk better though my only walking activity is going to the bathroom. I minimize walking to avoid tearing or aggravating the wound separation. Again, thank you very much for the advice on saline solution.

Thank you for this. I have been spraying it with hydrogen peroxide solution. It seems itâ€™s not helping

I donâ€™t think your supposed to use hydrogen peroxide on wounds and I think it may also damage dissolvable sutures.

Thatâ€™s what my doctor has been telling her patients. What is a saline solution? Can I do this at home or buy it at pharmacy stores?

Saline is a salt water solution, it&#39;s balanced properly so it doesn&#39;t sting wounds like seawater and is a good long term natural disinfectant. You can make it at home the ratio is 2 teaspoons of natural salt to one litre of water. From what I&#39;ve read hydrogen peroxide can slow down healing in the long term so I&#39;d recommend switching or reducing how much you use.

Also use boiled and cooled water for the mix. Also piercing shops sell it too. I must be sterile which tap water is not.

To clarify, the hydrogen peroxide solution being recommended by the OP&#39;s doctor is supposed to be 1 tbsp hydrogen peroxide to 1 cup water, so it&#39;s pretty dilute.  However, I would still expect a saline solution to be more gentle (but maybe not as good at disinfecting?).  A lot of ear piercing sites recommend boiling water, then adding between 1/8 to 1/2 tbsp salt (amount depends on the site you look at) to 1 cup water.
</p>
<p>
When I had FFS the doctor recommended aquaphor over the sutures and they healed really well.  But when I asked Dr. Wittenberg about aquaphor she said no.  Yet I see
<a href="http://www.atlskincancer.com/skin-healthcare/open-wound-care.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlskincancer.com/skin-healthcare/open-wound-care.aspx
</a>
recommending aquaphor to heal an open wound.  I feel like every doc comes up with somewhat arbitrary recommendations based on whatever they&#39;ve found seems to work or whatever they were told in medical school.  I suspect if you clean it well and then apply aquaphor it would stop your pain while peeing.

Thank you for responding to this. Itâ€™s past midnight and couldnâ€™t sleep because of pain and  discomfort. I shall try the aquaphor tomorrow. Praying for your healing.

I had some wound separation as well. It definitely looked bad, but my surgeon said it was fine and would heal on its own. He said it didnâ€™t require surgical intervention unless it got worse. I had to go back into the OR at three weeks for some bleeding from the canal and since I was already under he put some sutures in the separations.

Are you able to upload a photo? Wound separation is common but it may not actually be infected

Did you send your surgeon a picture before she gave you that feedback about anxiety? Wound dehiscence can run the gamut, but it&#39;s never fun. Typically it happens 10 to 14 days out. Other than seeing your therapist did she give you any useful tips on what you might do?

I sent her pictures. She just me itâ€™s not an infection. If you google wound infection, youâ€™ll see pictures of wound similar with mine. Plus I am not a total stupid. Iâ€™m well-read, have a good education and well-researched. Iâ€™m seen doctors with big egos. Itâ€™s pointless to argue. And Iâ€™ve seen so many times that after theyâ€™re done with their job, thatâ€™s it.

Oh, I get what your saying better than anyone, I&#39;ve dealt with it a lot. It fucks my who surgery up. I guess I was just trying to ascertain how she might be reading the severity of the problem.

Look at my profile under wound dehesence.  You can see what I mean. Is it to that level?

well let me tell you that problem was the basis of a lot of the other problems to come. It&#39;s called healing through second intention. My surgeon didn&#39;t intervene and resuture calling it a rookie mistake. Oh, the irony. There are people who have had similar issues where they went right back in and repaired.

OP&#39;s doctor says they don&#39;t re-suture because it can trap an infection in the area.  Seems different docs have different opinions.

Hi, I also had wound separation on my labia and pee would come out from it as well. I totally understand how you feel. Although mine never burned or hurt. It takes a long time to heal since it has to heal by second intention. My doctor told me to keep it as dry and clean as possible and prescribed me collagen wound dressings which works wonders. Maybe ask your doctor about it. Be patient it will slowly heal.
