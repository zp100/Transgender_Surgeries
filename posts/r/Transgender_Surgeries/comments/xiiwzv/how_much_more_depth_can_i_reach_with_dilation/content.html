Hey!
</p>
<p>
I had my MTF bottom surgery three weeks ago, and I am feeling a bit let down by my depth. It is &#34;only&#34; about 4 inches, which is I think on the low side of what is possible. How much more can I gain with a good dilation routine? (I am right now at three times every day) Is that enough for penetrative sex?
</p>

Please correct me if l am wrong and advise me but I heard that applying constant gentle pressure while dilating might give more depth but if you do it too much and it gets painful it might cause rapture, l will have my surgery soon and I will try this method very carefully, l will also get additional graft from groin, abdomen because I lack material.

Regular dilating and learning to control your pelvic muscles can probably give you half an inch.  I had a revision for my depth and I’m in a similar situation because I didn’t have much depth to begin with. If you’re talking about it working for penetrative penile sex, it really depends on your partner’s size.

Not completely correct. Some people have managed it.

I was 4.5inches after surgery and with dilating 3x a day and applying a little bit of pressure I managed to get to 5 inches. It is possible but take it slow and release the pressure when it hurts and try again slowly

You might be able to get a bit more, but regular dilation alone is not sufficient.

Would you mind naming your surgeon?

My surgeon was Schöll, from Munich.
</p>
<p>
I am otherwise very pleased with my result, it is of course not fully healed yet, but the things I can see look and feel really good.
</p>
<p>
I am also the only person I am aware of with not that long of a depth by him, and it confuses me a little.. before the surgery, my penis has been kinda small non-erect, but it had a very average length when erect, so nothing out of the ordinary.
</p>
<p>
But I have been very looking forward to penetrative sex once everything was healed, and this might become a bit more difficult now..
