Hello, because very few people talk about this and because I&#39;m quite sure not many are aware this is possible, I&#39;m talking about it.
</p>
<p>
I have undergone an orchiectomy and a labiaplasty without destroying my penis.  Basically it&#39;s an orchiectomy where the surgeon folds the scrotum into labia and leaves everything else as it is.  It is an out-patient procedure. My operation took 60 minutes.  I was home the same evening.  I paid 5300€ out of pocket.
</p>
<p>
I opted for this surgery because I&#39;m principally non-op but I was planning on an orchie anyway so I thought it couldn&#39;t hurt to ask my surgeon for this request.
</p>
<p>
I had to provide 1 letter from a psychiatrist and 1 letter stating that I was on HRT for at least 1 year.  The operation took place in Croatia.
</p>
<p>
They remove the testicles and they fold the scrotum into labia majora.  They do not create labia minora and they do not alter the urethra. They do not touch the penis to destroy it.  The end result is a penis without testicles and with labia.
</p>
<p>
As vaginoplasty is not wished for in my case, this was a very logical surgery for me.  I&#39;m very pleased with the results.  I didn&#39;t want a penile preserving vaginoplasty because I didn&#39;t want to dilate and I didn&#39;t want to donate peritoneal tissue for it and I didn&#39;t feel a need for it.  Just an orchie with a step extra.
</p>
<p>
My labia were packed for two days.  Third day he removed the bandage.  Pain was at all times under 3 on 10. Sitting was only uncomfortable during the first three days.  A few Tylenol pills took care of the minimal discomfort I felt at times.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 6 weeks post-op now. Everything healed well. It really looks like labia majora. I&#39;m pleased with the end result.  My penis shrank a tiny little bit but not much.  I had hot flashes during the first few weeks because my hormone doses had to be adjusted.
</p>
<p>
This is probably the safest and easiest gender confirmation surgery (that isn&#39;t just an orchiectomy) currently available.
</p>
<p>
Not every plastic surgeon will be willing to perform it.  You have to ask whether they want to do it or not.  Croatia has a few surgeons willing to do it.  I didn&#39;t want to fly to Thailand for such a simple procedure.  It&#39;s like a permanent tuck but much more comfortable.

Maybe later but not now as this sub is brigaded by TERFs recently. I don&#39;t want my body to be made into a mockery show by them.

I&#39;m very curious as well - although this I would not be interested in because my worst bit of dysphoria is all that and then some anyhow...  but quite intriguing!

My surgery was performed by Mladen Zagor in Dubrovnik, Croatia. In the US there is at least 1 surgeon who is also willing to perform it.  A trans woman on Reddit had this surgery before me last year.

I’ve considered something like this too. Thinking I want an orchiectomy, but don’t want an empty scrotum and labia is a nice idea to do with the skin.
</p>
<p>
How is this different than a penile preservation zero-depth vagnioplasty?

Because no vaginal opening is created at all. Just the the labia folds. Which is super simple and even could be preserve most of the skin if a indented fold were made.
</p>
<p>
Personally I would go for both labial folds, attempting to create a strong vulva, while preserving a small inner vaginal fold (when this heals it will just be a small spot, as skin retracts slowly,) but this would leave later options for vaginoplasty without exponential risk.

Have a really simple question. Would a later vaginoplasty be possible with this procedure?
</p>
<p>
I really hate current vaginoplasty methods, I&#39;m holding out for better options. But the rest speaks to exactly what I need/desire for now.

I had often thought that something like this could be done, but this is the first time I heard of it being done.

It is not often performed. I believe I&#39;m one of a handful of trans people in the world who have had this surgery done. First time I saw it done was last year here on Reddit. I contacted the person, asked her about details and shopped around for a surgeon who was competent and willing to perform the surgery. Some flat out refused because of ethical concerns. I had it done in Croatia. Surgery was 5300 euro out of pocket. Recovery was same as for an orchiectomy. If one doesn&#39;t have too much genital dysphoria, this can be an excellent solution.

Would you mind saying who your surgeon was.

Is there any way I can get in touch with this surgeon? This sounds like my holy grail surgery.

So you have labia but no vaginal cavity? This feels much like my zero depth SRS then. I have labia and a clitoris but no real vaginal cavity apart from an indent of 1 inch. The big difference between your surgery and my surgery seems to be that I have labia minora aside of labia majora and that I have a clitoris whereas with you they preserved the penis? My surgery took 90 minutes. My urethra was rerouted.
</p>
<p>
Do you plan on further GRS or is this your end destination? Can they convert it to a vaginoplasty if you ever wish to do so?
