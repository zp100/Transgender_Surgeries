Here lately I‚Äôve been wanting wider hips. I thought my hips would widen more slightly, with weight gain five months post op orchiectomy and after about 4 years of HRT, and nothings really happened. So now I‚Äôm considering hip implants. Has anyone that‚Äôs had them here been able to have a decent size implant put in, and still been able to maintain an active lifestyle. By active I mean, running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Also do these implants feel as natural as breast implants?

Hi
<a href="/u/Lola-popz" rel="nofollow">u/Lola-popz
</a>
, I had hip implants or &#34;pelvic plasty&#34; to be precise in Seoul, South Korea at
<a href="http://ysbarochuk.com/en/" rel="nofollow">Yonsei Baro Chuk hospital with Dr Won
</a>
. The result turned out to be really amazing and natural. So they attach a titanium implant on your pelvic bone (+ silicone implant underneath to smoothen out the result if you&#39;re skinny).
</p>
<p>
They are quite permanent I would say and I feel like the titanium implants become just like my own pelvic bones, though I always get careful not to sleep on the side just in case if anything happen - despite the xray result showing all the healing went well, and implants well-attached.
</p>
<p>
However, I&#39;m feeling excruciating &#34;stretching&#34; pain 3-month post op from the silicone implant on one side - which might be a nerve or muscle issue I guess. It comes and goes. Though I realize not everyone has this issue. I&#39;ll be visiting them again to see what they could do.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m not encouraging you to do the same. But personally, I love the result - especially when you&#39;re looking for a more dramatic and permanent change. I&#39;ll create a post to tell about my experience in detail when I have time. You could also checkout Meja&#39;s review,

. She did it way earlier than me.

I paid 27,083,000 KRW (19,701 USD at the time). And they adjusted (lowered the price) to 14,500 USD just a few weeks after I had the surgery! XD
</p>
<p>
Though they mentioned they wanted to make it more accessible to everyone, which is amazing.

Motiva ergo implants are designed to immunize chance of capitulation. Experience you mean anecdotal evidence? I see from my limit unscientific case so it must be logic is a very low form of logic and what uneducated folk do. I‚Äôll trust science and mathematics and my PhD and research over I see evidence. That mentality is horrible and partially why trans folk are hated so much and why so many assume transwomen must look like cross dressers with big bone frames. There is actually scientific evidence and rational why motiva ergos are more natural and safer than other implants. Sure something say come out saying otherwise but with the info currently available they are the best. The only reason why the US doesn‚Äôt allow them is due to regulation but the EU has stricter safety regulations.

May I ask if you have had breast implants put in. ? If so I&#39;m assuming you had motiva ?? .... BTW I&#39;m not saying motiva isn&#39;t a good option. I&#39;m just saying they are not the only realistic breast implants available. Like you were suggesting. Any implant can look and feel natural with a good base tissue and good surgeon.

Thank you. I&#39;ve enjoyed this discussion. Also I won&#39;t be going to Korea for FFS .... I have a friend who is going over there and I&#39;ve tried to warn her about the same thing you just mentioned but she won&#39;t listen and so I thought if I got some feedback from here maybe I could relay to her. . I personally don&#39;t think I need FFS  at this stage . My main focus is SRS in august. Then I&#39;ll get a BBL a year later.

Yes, I understand, but I was curious about the specific reason why you&#39;ve had multiple BAs in the past (I&#39;ve never done it and I&#39;m always interested in hearing specific/unique experiences in this stage of my pre-surgical research).
