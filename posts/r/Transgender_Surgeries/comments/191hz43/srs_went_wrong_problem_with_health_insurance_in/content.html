I didn&#39;t think about crowdfunding before, thanks :) I don&#39;t want to take a loan, so I want to try everything. But seriously, do you think crowdfunding is possible?  It is hard to believe for me people will donate something like this

I mean I could give a little bit, but would you get enough would be dependent on how many saw it. It&#39;s a volume = success proposition.

from time to time I have seen crowdfunding for ppl shared on queer and trans facebook tho, I hope I am not mistaken and it was CZ/SK facebook, memory hard, but I am not sure if it worked for them
</p>
<p>
I dunno, honestly, I hope it is viable bc I am poor as fuck myself and insurence is going to pay only part of the costs if I am lucky convincing them that is
</p>
<p>
maybe there can be something done regarding this in irl based queer scenes too, I dunno

If you can, Thailand may be a better option for revision.

I was amazed by results from the Dr. Markovsky team because they also do some revisions. They told me this will be no little revision but a whole remake (so the price will also be counted as the whole SRS surgery). They even plan a skin transplantation to achieve some normal vaginal depth.
</p>
<p>
But maybe I should reconsider if in Thailand the result I would get will be better and maybe even cheaper.
</p>
<p>
But I also saw some not good result from Thailand (but mine looks alwas worse). So there are some srugeons I should avoid.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask where should I a go and where I should not?

<p>
there is a policy and law that the insurance will not pay you the costs of surgery abroad if the surgery can be done in your country
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah, the UK is the same way wrt funding surgery in the EU (we are still a part of the S2 scheme despite leaving the EU). Which makes it practically impossible to get trans surgeries abroad via S2 because &#34;we have trans surgeons at home!&#34; etc.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not familiar with the Czech healthcare system. Do you get one single health insurance from the government, or do you buy private health insurance like in the US? If you have the option of different health insurances it may be worth asking them to see if they will cover you going anywhere in the EU.

I would go to Thailand straight away because Germany is too expensive and the options are also very limited.

The good news is I think you are in great shape for a beautiful revision, seriously. Lots of available skin to work on the labia with. Nothing really looks bad here.

I am no expert in czech health- and insurance laws... but did you try to ask the clinic for advise or help? Another way to find help or answers would be to ask in czech specific subreddits and forums regarding health insurance, because this rule applies not only to srs but to all medical procedures.
<br>
The other way around would be much easiert...
</p>
<p>
I really do hope you find aworking solution

A lawyer told me clinques protect themselves by a document you have to sign before every surgery. In the document you agree you are aware of every post surgery complications bla bla blah.
</p>
<p>
So my case was thrown out from the table at the beginning

That&#39;s not a complication, though?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s clearly a bad job done. But... I guess the best thing you can do is legally defame them by sharing your experiences of them on Google reviews or reviews in general! Make fewer people want to go to this doctor... and have that doctor then lose clients!

How is it a complication if they fail to do what the surgery was meant to do?  It looks like they repositioned your penis and took out your testes.  They were supposed to remove the majority of your phallus, turn the erectile remnant into a clitoris, create labia, and create a vagina.  They did none of that.  The fact that it took 3 surgeries to create your current situation is horrific.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry you have gone through this.  At the very least, have you asked a lawyer to help you get an exception to the rule of available-domestically-therefore-no-paying-for-international-services?  Hopefully the bar to sue for malpractice is higher than the bar for getting an exception.

Hmm, everybody thanks for your comments :) you maybe gave me a strenght to try it again. I will try more LGBT friendly lawyer (I have met a lots of people which I believe could help me but they hurt me becasue still there are lots of conservative people who do not have the understanding and empathy). I believe there is some transgender international organization (I can&#39;t remember the name) in Europe so I will write them and told them what is happening. I will write to the clinique where I had the surgery. Today I have written to the Dr. Lubos Kliniken, it seems they are able to write for me some anamnesis and examination of my current nonstandard state , so the document can be also used in thid process

Dear, I&#39;m so sorry for this. It&#39;s totally unfair you have to deal with this. Try Dr. Theerapong in Thailand, his work is amazing on results like your. Good luck.

Just want to say this looks like it can definitely be fixed and will be beautiful in the end. It’s good that you have lots of tissue to work with. The clitoral glans is very well-shaped.

Oh please, don&#39;t offend trans men :)
</p>
<p>
If there is something I learnt from my mistake it is you should be always very picky when choosing a surgeon or anyone who will do something with your body (especially doctors). If there will be at least one red flag I will avoid these people. I hope other trans people will do not make the same mistake in believe there is no other option.
</p>
<p>
If I was able to turn back the time I would get an orchi first so I can change my name and legal sex. After that I would get the GRS abroad. So there was an option.
</p>
<p>
Another problem is there is really no info about these surgeries in my country (no photos etc). So another reason to avoid the surgeon.

I&#39;m allowed to offend other trans men to be fair. They enjoy it.
</p>
<p>
My point is that you are getting closer even if you deserved better.
</p>
<p>
I fully agree, many people don&#39;t realize the likelihood that these people are sociopaths, because they would never promise something and deliver something significantly different otherwise. Yeah no photo, no good.
