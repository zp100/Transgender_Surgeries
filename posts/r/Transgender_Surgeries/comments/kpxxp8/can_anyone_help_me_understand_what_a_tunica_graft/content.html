I have started to hear in a few places about tunica grafts in the context of vaginoplasty. but I am unsure what exactly these are.. I
<em>
think
</em>
that its a graft that goes inside the vagina in order to more naturally recreate the lining of a cis-vagina. is that right?
</p>
<p>
are there limitations on when they are appropriate? what are the advantages/disadvantages of getting a graft? and are there particular surgeons who are/are not willing to perform this?
</p>
<p>
sorry for all the questions and thank you in advance for any guidance!

The vagina (not the vulva) is typically made up of two pieces of skin.  The outermost section is made up of the shaft of the penis.  Typically the innermost section is made up of scrotal skin.
</p>
<p>
The tunica vaginalis peritoneum tissue is a sack that surrounds each testicle.  During an orchiectomy, this tissue is normally thrown away.  Rather than using the scrotal skin for the inside and end of the vagina, this skin is used.
</p>
<p>
This is performed by very few surgeons right now, Ting and Avanessian are the main two I am aware of, but there is more.
</p>
<h2>
Upsides
</h2>
<p>
There is zero possibility of hair because that tissue doesn&#39;t have hair stem cells.   And like the inner lining of your mouth it is always moist.  It will probably be always &#34;wet&#34;.  It doesn&#39;t get more or less wet depending on if you are aroused.  And you will still need lubricant for sex, if only for the entrance which can be not wet, but also potentially because there isn&#39;t enough on the inside.  Also this peritoneum tissue you can access without robots poking holes in your abdomen.  Your tunica tissue might be enough to give you more depth than the standard PI.  About 7&#34; v.s. 6&#34; from what I can gather.
</p>
<h2>
Downsides
</h2>
<p>
The main downside is the there is pretty much no long term data on using this tissue, at all.  It might be like the peritoneum tissue that is used for PPT, but we don&#39;t know.  Honestly, it is experimenting.  It might get wet enough to cause you to have to wear a liner all of the time.  Something to think about is you can only choose one, scrotal skin or tunica tissue.  The other one gets tossed out in the surgery.  The other can&#39;t be used in a revision.
</p>
<p>
Lastly and this is what for me is the killer downside: not all surgeons do this so if you want to go with say McGinn who has one of the most consistent results she won&#39;t do it.
</p>
<h2>
Neutral
</h2>
<p>
You don&#39;t have to remove hair on the scrotal graft, but you
<em>
still
</em>
need to do 12-18 months of hair removal on the shaft, etc.  So less area to clear, but not less start-finish time.  This type of tissue
<strong>
does not
</strong>
change the amount of dilation you will or will not have to do.

Commenting separately from the other post so that you see it - the other important thing to learn here is the distinction between a graft and a flap. A graft is the movement of tissue from one source area to another, wherein the blood supply is &#39;reattached&#39;, while a flap ensures that the tissue is never disconnected from the source area, leaving the blood supply intact.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m targeting a Tunica Vaginalis flap procedure through Dr Purohit, and it seems really interesting to me, because of the ability to use a flap.

A tunica graft is a surgery that some of the doctors in Thailand use (suporn is one) and is a speciality of the team under Jess Ting at Mt Sinai.  It is a modified penile inversion vaginoplasty, where the very end of the neo-vaginal canal is made with this tissue.  This tissue is what encases the individual testes and is like peritoneal tissue, so it is mucosal and lubricating.  As with all such tissues, they are constantly lubricating, not based on arousal, and none of these options are potentially enough to obviate the use of lube.
</p>
<p>
I have variously read though without seeing any scientific basis that this tissue gradually grows to cover the rest of the vaginal canal.  It is definitely, however, the tissue that would have become the vaginal lining had an AMAB been born AFAB...so in that sense it &#34;knows&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The main advantage I can see with this method is that 1. it adds a wee bit of depth with tissue that would have been otherwise discarded to a penile inversion, and 2. it is less invasive than the peritoneal pull-through method which involves abdominal surgery.  That said, there is not a lot of history with this type of operation, so it underlines that trans women are a vast experiment.
