Good results. It’s a shame that it took a threat of class action lawsuit against him to stop destroying people’s live.

Lol yeah for sure. He knows we are building a class action lawsuit against him.  Do you think it’s a coincidence that all those post of beautiful vulvas are showing up with all the bad ones in the wiki pages with links not working anymore? Except mine because I am the one filing the class action against him.
</p>
<p>
I will be sharing in the following weeks a call between me and their lawyers in which one of them state to the judge that the reason why they are not responding to my questions is because it would incriminate themselves.
</p>
<p>
Brassard is a fraud. He has been for years.  Don’t get me wrong those are good results but they are not representative of the majority.
</p>
<p>
Destroying lives  for years and trying to cover it up later when he’s in hot water doesn’t make him a good person.
</p>
<p>
Clearly he has the talent to make nice one. He just choose $ instead of the care of trans girl. hundreds if not thousands have lost sensation, desire to live because of him.
</p>
<p>
Now we are returning the favour to him. It’s time for other surgeons not tie to him to be able to do surgeries in Canada.
</p>
<p>
Canadian trans girl deserve the right to choose their surgeon based on valid and trustworthy reviews, experiences and results. Not from a guy that controls everything trans related surgeries(GRS) in Canada.

It&#39;s incredibly nervewracking to me as a trans guy in Quebec. If I want bottom surgery ONLY GRS Montreal is covered, and they don&#39;t even offer the majority of options for phalloplasty (there&#39;s a bunch out there... Brassard et al just don&#39;t do them)
</p>
<p>
Sensation is my main concern, so it&#39;s terrifying, especially since there&#39;s very little info (good or bad) on his team&#39;s transmasc bottom surgery. And if there&#39;s so many bad experiences on the transfem side, I can only imagine...

Unfortunately I don’t know a lot of trans men and from what I know Maude is the one doing the surgeries and she has a way better reputation then Brassard. I mean I’ve never heard a lot of complaints about Maude.
</p>
<p>
That being said there is a general bad rep when we are talking about post up care, follow up, etc coming from there’s Not sure if again it applies to Men.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for bringing this up as  I will try to gather info on it.
</p>
<p>
It goes back to Brassard being like the Canadian “king pin” of trans surgeries deciding for everyone what is good.  Which really to me shows a huge problem knowing that there is multiple trust and honesty issues.
</p>
<p>
Is what being offered for trans men the best for them or best for GRS Montreal vs how much they can pocket per surgery.
</p>
<p>
Even more alarming is where are the studies or documentations explaining why the other type of surgeries are not offered.
</p>
<p>
When I reached out to provincials government I received all the same response. GRS Montreal is responsible of establishing everything.
</p>
<p>
Thanks:)

Phalloplasty has various donor sites - forearm for Radial Forearm Flap (RFF), thigh for Anterolateral Thigh (ALT), and back muscle for Musculocutaneous Latissimus Dorsi Flap (MLD). Despite multiple techniques with different pros and cons, it seems GRS Montreal only does RFF.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, a lot of surgeons in the US offer phalloplasty without vaginectomy (which is what I want, for a multitude of reasons). According to their site, GRS Montreal won&#39;t do it, even if you opt not to get urethral lengthening (which is the main concern with phallo without vaginectomy - higher complication rate). I did see a post in a Facebook group from someone who apparently went there and got phallo without vaginectomy, but it&#39;s the only case I could find.
</p>
<p>
From the research I&#39;ve done, I totally agree with you that Brassard&#39;s attitude - and by extension his clinic - is very firm on doing things a certain way, and has nobody to really challenge them on that in Canada. It&#39;s like we&#39;re so behind the times here on surgery options, because GRS Montreal can just say &#34;we only do surgery this way&#34; and there&#39;s literally no other options. Kingpin is a good way to put it.
</p>
<p>
The reviews I&#39;ve seen of their metaiodoplasty (non-phalloplasty transmasc bottom surgery, it&#39;s a clitoral release and sometimes placement change, often with urethral lengthening) and the occasional phallo on transbucket also don&#39;t rate them great on sensation, which is
<em>
extremely
</em>
concerning for me as someone who has sensation as a top priority.
</p>
<p>
It really sucks how few options there are. It&#39;s like they don&#39;t have to try to update techniques because pretty much every trans person in Canada has to go there, unless you want to pay a fortune.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!! I appreciate your documentation and spreading awareness.

If you live in BC, you have another team as an option now that serves only BC.
</p>
<p>
Starting Sept 2019, BC has their own gender surgery program based out of Vancouver that is covered by MSP. The surgeons are Dr. Genoway and Dr. Kavanagh. They are up and running, though they had a slow start due to the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Results are still yet to come. I know a number of trans masc folks who got surgery, including myself, but haven&#39;t seen anything on the femme side.
</p>
<p>
By the time you pursue bottom surgery, you will probably have a better chance of seeing some results. Currently folks can choose Montreal or Vancouver for surgery now so you do have a choice if you stay in BC.

Thanks I’ll check it out. I know the Ontario surgeon was trained by Brassard. Do you know who is their mentor?
</p>
<p>
Also do you know anyone who got their surgeries there. Ask them is they wouldn’t mind chatting me.  In private, don’t mention them here.
</p>
<p>
Would have  some question in regards of their experiences, surgery time. Etc
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your comment. Much useful info.

I believe the team did a lot of training in the US. My experience is moreso with masculinizing procedures, and I know they studied metoidioplasty and phalloplasty with Dr. Chen and his team, but I am sure there are others.
</p>
<p>
The team is only working with referrals in BC and no one has been vocal with me about anything but meta and phallo, sorry. I know the team has told a friend of mine as of last month they had done 4-5 vaginoplasty so far.
</p>
<p>
My personal experience with the team so far has been very positive. They are careful not to insult the team in Montreal, but for metoidioplasty at least, have made it clear they do things quite differently.

Ok so pretty much people are still going to Montreal. In 3-4 in 2 years is nothing.
</p>
<p>
No I get that. I had another surgeon tell me that about mtl surgeries that they are the quick and out surgeons.
</p>
<p>
So even in their community some thinks we are being served the cheap stuff.
</p>
<p>
Thanks :)

The impression I get is that they opened for referrals in Sept of 2019, but started surgery in Jan 2020, primarily with metoidioplasty and repairs of other procedures. The pandemic stopped surgery from March until around June, and things have picked back up from there.
</p>
<p>
The lack of surgery is also related to the team requiring hair removal for most procures. Hair removal is covered by MSP if folks are referred to it, but they need to do a consult to get the referral. You can&#39;t really rush hair removal. Add that to the low OR hours they are allotted and it is quite slow. The intent is to likely pick up the pace, but both surgeons also do other procedures so things are taking a lot of time to move forward. Folks are certainly still going to Montreal at this point but there are options.

Oh no that I know.I remember is support groups early on some guy where talking about it. I know they were all doing it on their forearms to eventually get the surgery. Like laser was not recommended even though some actually kill hair when it goes deep enough.  So it’s was electro.

Omg I hope for you that the peritoneal surgery is available and practice by trustworthy doctors. Tho this is just based on some reviews I keep reading about. I’m a few years maybe things will be even better.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the real thing haha. Like what they do with cloning vagina’s maybe in a couple year it will be offered:)

...do you honestly think that your threats to him is what has made your perceived difference in results?...he has performed well over 7500 gender surgeries and of course we usually hear so much more about someones poor result but how many are actually the surgeons fault in ANY treatment?...there are things well beyond the surgeons control once a patient leaves the operating room...Brassard has shown time and time again that he produces above average results and is held in high regard by his peers in gender surgery...Marci Bowers puts him in a list of surgeons she considers as good alternatives to herself, the list includes the likes of Jess Ting, Bella Avanessian, Suporn and Toby Meltzer...all of which are great surgeons in their own right...bashing Brassard is doing nothing and certainly not helping anyone who may be considering him for their own surgery, yes YOU had a bad experience and youre not happy and for that i am sorry, but no one here knows what it is that he did wrong, if anything, only that you are not happy with the result...good luck with your lawsuit...

Omg there  is a lot more than my bad results. Do your research. Hundreds of complaints. Brassard does not do all surgeries.
</p>
<p>
People that took their lives. People that end up in ER because bad work.
</p>
<p>
No response from clinic.
</p>
<p>
Lies
</p>
<p>
Withholding information
</p>
<p>
Bunch of girls suffering
</p>
<p>
Charging provincial governments 5k in corrections when barely nothing was done. And after doing surgeries in 1:30minutes.
</p>
<p>
Bunch of girls with no feeling. Dead clitoris.
</p>
<p>
Charging full aftercare fee to provincial government while shipping girls in hotel to fend for themselves post up with no after care.
</p>
<p>
Having standard of care that changes from province to province. As if trans girls need were actually different across the river.
</p>
<p>
Making girls signs bunch of legal forms 30 minutes prior to surgery but asking them 3 times if they are aware why they are here. Demonstrating that yes girls prior to surgery might be in shock and anxious. Therefore should not have to sign legal documents.
</p>
<p>
You know I actually care about others. Because I KNOW how it destroys someone to be played with. Mistreated. Taking away their chances to the life they’ve always wanted.
</p>
<p>
So no I won’t stop exposing a surgeon that fails tons of article of his own deontology code and has a complete Monopoly over everything trans related in Canada.
</p>
<p>
As long as Brassard has girls defending him based of couple reviews and not actually look at the global picture. Canadian girls will continue to be force to play Russian roulette with probably the most important surgery of their lives.
</p>
<p>
So no I won’t stop until the monopoly is gone and that Brassard is under quality and standard controls.
</p>
<p>
And not the carte blanche that he has. Because  yes I did an ATIP to provinces and he decided what’s best for us without any structure , quality control or standard of care other than the general medical fields one.
</p>
<p>
So continuing like this is like stating that the only place human should eat is McDonald’s and that McDonald decide the menu, what you should eat, how much and when.

Just as I felt secure in feeling like I finally found a surgeon I can trust to go through the hassle of travelling from the UK for, bloody hell. The selfishness of humanity in the face of corporate gain is forever the bane of my existence. What a bother.

Honestly the results that were posted are good. Like I said people are like pissed at me cuz I call him out. But I can tell you that when a surgeon is     being watched it’s probably when he makes his best works. Like go in my profile and grab the pic of my terrible vulva and ask for someone here same thing with one you like and show him.  You have my permission to use my pics as you see fit.  Like I want this and not that. If he cannot guarantee we’ll then it’s better that you don’t go to him.
</p>
<p>
Have them is an email what standard of care you will received post OP. How long your surgery will be. Like make him accountable.
</p>
<p>
My wish is for surgeons to be competent and respectful towards us. But what Montreal is doing is having other surgeons practicing cheap surgeries and fooling patient that Brassard did them.
</p>
<p>
Bring a freaking little batterie recorder underneath your robe.
</p>
<p>
Like the guy can do a good job. He just doesn’t do them all. And skip on them.
</p>
<p>
If you get him to buy an actual respectif amount of surgery time. ( not 1:30) you’ll probably have great results.
</p>
<p>
Like all trans girl need to make him accountable. If he doesn’t like it than he can just retire.

Dr. Krakowsky at WCH in Toronto is another available option. So is going out of country (potentially, I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s been affected now that WCH is online albeit with a significant waitlist.)

Hope your recovery has been going well in all aspects :3

The result is still very early on and theres probably still a lot of swelling, theres likely some decent detailing in there, but the swelling early on makes it difficult to spot.
</p>
<p>
At least thats how it was with mine
