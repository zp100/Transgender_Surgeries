<p>
&#34;The [World Professional Association for Transgender Health] Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People are international clinical protocols outlining the recommended assessment and treatment for gender non-conforming individuals across the lifespan or transgender or transsexual people who wish to undergo social, hormonal or surgical transition to the other sex. Clinicians&#39; decisions regarding patients&#39; treatment are often influenced by this standard of care (SOC). They are most widespread SOC used by professionals working with transsexual, transgender, or gender variant people.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Also, the WPATH SoC is what insurance companies look to when they&#39;re deciding what care is actually &#34;medically necessary&#34;
</p>
<p>
The draft of the next version of the SoC is now available for public comments at the link above. Anyone who has a stake in transgender medicine should at least read though the sections applicable to themselves, and consider commenting.
</p>
<p>
The public comment window closes on 12/16/2021

I&#39;ve read through the surgery section (starts on page 263) and skimmed a few other sections. One thing that stands out to me is a lack of discussion of hair removal procedures and their benefits.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a brief mention of it for surgical sites but facial and body hair removal is not explicitly mentioned anywhere except for a section about non-binary folks in the context of them not wanting the HRT effects of growing facial hair when on T.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s quite a disappointing omission considering the medical necessity of hair removal for a lot of TGNC people. It&#39;s going to give insurance companies another out for not covering it and leave us paying a fortune for electrolysis and laser treatments.

Fully agreed. I was appalled to see that there was no section about it, let alone that it was barely mentioned at all in tangentially-relevant sections. I think the lack of a dedicated section for it also undermines their goal of hearing feedback from the community, considering the feedback format is very compartmentalised. I imagine they would find that a significant portion of trans individuals, especially trans women, would benefit greatly from hair removal.

Did it only just open up for comments? Because if it did then two weeks is clearly not long enough and they are likely not interested in public comments.
</p>
<p>
And they plan on releasing the final document by the end of the year? Two weeks after comments close. What’s the point?
</p>
<p>
<em>
Edit: it looks like they are delaying the release date of the final document. Too many complaints maybe.

They sent the email out at 12:34 MST today (edit: today was 12/2). On Tuesday 11/30 they said &#34;This is a note to advise you that WPATH will be sending out the SOC8 draft for public comment by the end of this week. There will be a two-week comment period, which will not be extended.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t necessarily think they don&#39;t want comments, but rather that they&#39;re still trying to get the new SoC out by the end of the year. If they made the comment period any longer, they probably couldn&#39;t achieve that goal. Not sure why they&#39;re tryna rush it, but IMHO they are

They are obviously rushing it so they don’t get comments. It’s been years in the making already, another few months or even another year wouldn’t  make any difference.
</p>
<p>
I’ve not read it yet, hopefully this is not because there’s something bad in there.

I&#39;ve glanced through most of it, seems better in general (e.g. only 1 assessment for everything, 6 months HRT for genital surgery) though might be slightly more gatekeepy outside surgical contexts due to suggesting that one assessment.

I mean perhaps you&#39;re correct and someone what&#39;s to suppress something in the SoC. I didn&#39;t get that feeling from the little bit of the USPATH 2021 symposium I was able to attend, but it&#39;s possible. Perhaps there&#39;s fear about what Dr. Bowers could try with the SoC if she had major control over it&#39;s development?
</p>
<p>
Either way the best thing to do is read carefully and make our thoughts known

I think it means distribution as if it is a final document and copying because it is intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
For example building codes and scientific testing are not to be distributed or copied because they are the property of the governing body and need to be purchased. Draft versions especially aren’t supposed to be distributed because when context is taken away they could be put forward as final and in current use. Like if someone begins using this document and snips a portion of the page, it is not necessarily the final version but no one would know that without fine detail review.

anybody thats actually involved in local city government have seen rushed and nearly impossible to access for the most marginalized and affected communities. if you feel stressed or that nothing youd do would matter right, im here to tell you that on purpose and that&#39;s the point. Yes wpath helps us and yes its still apart of the medical industrial complex and that is informed by colonial white supremacy as most institutions in the world are. Otherwise the most marginalized trans people would be running this shit.
</p>
<p>
The language use in this document is so condescending and shows more medical dominance then actually fostering community autonomy or the idea that people closest to and the issue are closest to the answer. Not to mention there are trans doctors and i havent even heard of a committee of them as part of the WPATH at the very least. but i could be wrong and its still not the point. This needs to be centered around trans voices and we should atleast make our comments know so they cant tell us we wanted this.

I think that&#39;s correct, but its worth following what they do. Its trans people who are quite unhappy with WPATH. They have a Facebook group with some interesting and informed discussion.

&#34;Requiring that TGD patients/clients undertake objectifying or unjustified mental health treatment,  especially for protracted lengths of time, in order to access gender-affirming care creates a  power imbalance between mental health professionals and their patients/clients.&#34;
</p>
<p>
This is from the Ethics section under Beneficence. Its  well intentioned but shouldn&#39;t &#34;protracted lengths of time&#34; be specifically defined? Otherwise its left up to the judgement of individual doctors many of whom will have bias.

As another poster pointed out too, they are tailoring their recommendations based purely on physical health, not recommending progesterone because of the possibility that risks outweigh benefits. Totally ignoring the psychological aspect to not get care.
</p>
<p>
Imo this is what happens when you want to depathologize gender dysphoria and take it out of the mental health field. Gender dysphoria is in no way comparable to being gay and &#34;allies&#34; need to stop saying it should be removed just like homosexuality. There very much is a psychological component to this that can lead to suicide.

To be clear I don&#39;t support pathologizing transness. I think hrt and other medical care should be provided on an informed consent basis and shouldn&#39;t require mental health evaluations at all. A big part of the ethical section of these new guidelines is moving away from treating transness as a mental condition which the quote I used points out if you look at in context. Thats a good thing. But if mental health evaluations are going to be required (which I believe is wrong) the least WPATH can do is set clear and specific limits on how long they can be used to stop someone from getting medical care. Right now they just use the phrase &#34;protracted lengths of time&#34; which is vague and ill-defined. That was my point, not the transmedicalism you&#39;re spouting

But they legitimately aren&#39;t taking suicide rates into account with their standards of care. It&#39;s insane to try to take the mental health component out of this. I&#39;m not even suggesting any mandates or specific timelines here so you can cool it with the transmed stuff. I&#39;m talking about how they aren&#39;t taking mental health into account with things aside from the surgery. Sure their are risks to some of the interventions and medicines, but to not recommend them purely on a basis of physical health is insane considering how it saves lives.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m arguing for increased access to medications here, not restrictions. I would think you would be in support of it. Progesterone had a profoundly positive effect on my girlfriend&#39;s mental health and these standards say it&#39;s not recommended because of physical health only.
</p>
<p>
How can you want to remove mental health from this when our suicide rates are so high? Maybe you don&#39;t struggle with bad enough dysphoria but many of us do.
</p>
<p>
I also didn&#39;t say pathologists transness, I said pathologizing gender dysphoria. I&#39;m pretty sure the consensus is you don&#39;t need dysphoria to be trans so I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s pathologizing being trans.

Lots of populations have a higher risk of suicide. That doesn&#39;t mean their existence is a mental health issue. Correlation does not equal causation. Cis men are more likely to die by suicide than women but considering being a cis man a mental illness is obsurd. I think trans people deserve the same consideration.
</p>
<p>
I actually did struggle with being suicidal when I was younger. But I found that doctors pathologizing transness made it harder for me to get care, not easier. They&#39;d assume all of my mental health issues were rooted in me being trans which wasn&#39;t the case for me. Almost every psychiatrist I ever saw assumed my self harm was because of dysphoria but it was really more to do with regulating my emotions. Most doctors wouldn&#39;t accept that as an answer and it made their treatment ineffective. In my experience pathologizing transness leads to doctors into a mental health version of Trans Broken Arm Syndrome. They see transness as the only cause of a person&#39;s mental illness and treat us as a diagnosis but not a patient.
</p>
<p>
In terms of Progrestrone I totally agree with you. I think it should be provided through informed consent just like all other hrt.

Omg how many times do I need to say that pathologizing GENDER DYSPHORIA is NOT pathologizing being trans. Being trans does not require dysphoria. PLEASE do not push to remove gender dysphoria from the DSM. For Christ sake even the DSM itself says it isn&#39;t required.

Okay but I have gender dysphoria. I was diagnosed with it and everything. But it has nothing to do with my mental health issues. What I&#39;m saying is that having GD categorized as a mental illness leads doctors to treat it as the cause of all of their trans patients symptoms. Thats whats happened to me with 90% of psychiatrists I&#39;ve seen. You getting angry online will not change my experience. I&#39;m against pathologizing transness, including the categorization of GD, because its led to me getting substandard care. The DSM adding a single line about GD not being required to be trans doesn&#39;t change that. Getting rid of the categorization might so thats what I&#39;m in favor of.

So because you are lucky enough to not have any mental health issues connected to your GD then absolutely nobody does or even could have their experience be that GD is related? Please try to have some empathy here your experience is not universal.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a problem of shitty doctors not GD being in the DSM. Have you never heard of trans broken arm syndrome? It&#39;s not even about GD being in the DSM or not, if you are trans they will just assume that&#39;s why you broke your arm.

I think the confusion between you and the other replies is that there are multiple kinds of dysphoria and everyone&#39;s talking about different ones. Would it be right to say that you are referring to hormonal/chemical dysphoria? The feeling of being on the right or wrong hormones? Because that I would say does have a direct link to mental health which considering how
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1534582305277152" rel="nofollow">well known</a>
the effects of sex hormones on mental health are it is indeed incredibly important that we modulate care with this in mind, firstly in how beneficial it can be and therefore more reason why it should be given, and how regimes can be optimised with this in mind. Because yeah, I might get dysphoric looking at my reflection and not like what I can see, but at least I can go about my day.

Stop this. There is absolutely no link between pathologising being trans and preventing suicide. Both have improved simultaneously: we&#39;ve stopped getting pathologised
<em>
and
</em>
care has improved. Preventing suicide is achieved by increasing access, not stigmatizing our identities.

What would that have to do with requiring mental health care for all trans people, who by definition don&#39;t need gender dysphoria? What does the DSM have to do with this at all?

Holy fuck please actually read my comments I addressed all this this.
</p>
<p>
First I&#39;m not supporting any mandates do you can stfu about &#34;requiring&#34; mental health care. I support 0 requirements.
</p>
<p>
Second the DSM literally fucking agrees with you and says in it that you don&#39;t need dysphoria to be trans, so the DSM isn&#39;t relevant for all trans people, ONLY trans people with gender dysphoria who fell it causes mental distress and want therapy to help them navigate transition and life as a trans person. You see to get insurance to cover therapy therapists have to say you have
<em>
some
</em>
condition literally
<em>
any
</em>
condition to bill to therapy and I can absolutely believe there are trans people that don&#39;t want a condition they don&#39;t have being billed so that they can get therapy covered. Also know the opposite is also true, people can have GD and NOT be trans and those people deserve support living with their GD too.
</p>
<p>
Third the WPATH did not take mental health effects into account AT ALL for anything outside therapy.
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1534582305277152" rel="nofollow">There is a well established link between hormone levels and mental health and functioning</a>
yet these WPATH standards for example say that progesterone is not recommended purely because they don&#39;t know if the physical health benefits outweigh the physical health risks. Totally fucking ignoring how progesterone can be an important addiction for a trans woman mental health.
</p>
<p>
So if you don&#39;t like people with GD taking progesterone or being able to go to therapy WHEN THEY WANT TO then I guess you don&#39;t like my position.
</p>
<p>
I literally just want people with GD to have the option to go to therapy to get help figuring it out, navigating it, and coping with fucked up hormones levels and their effects pre transition. I also want people with GD to get the meds that will stop them from literally fucking killing themselves, even if the meds aren&#39;t proven to do something in transition yet.
</p>
<p>
Why the hell do you hate people with gender dysphoria that have their own experience be that it comes along with plenty of mental health challenges. You don&#39;t have that struggle? Fucking awesome, I&#39;m really happy you don&#39;t have to deal with this. But if that&#39;s the case your experience is not universal and some people would like to talk about their GD in therapy and not lie and have it billed under another condition. I myself wouldn&#39;t care and would just get it billed under something else but there are lots of people who care exactly what diagnoses they carry.

This entire thread was in response to you talking about people wanting &#34;GD removed from the DSM&#34; (is this even a thing?) after someone quoted from wpath that trans people shouldn&#39;t have to go through
<em>
unnecessary
</em>
psychological assessments. Unsurprisingly, every single person that responded to you thought you were suggesting that trans folks had somehow shot ourselves in the foot by demanding the depathologisation of trans-ness.
</p>
<p>
If you weren&#39;t talking about that and just wanted to talk about progesterone being covered by insurance in the US (note, not the only country that the wpath guidelines impact), then I guess fine? Why you would bring it up here I have no idea.
</p>
<p>
On that topic though, not pathologising trans folks and letting them do informed consent treatments is not only how you get more access and less suicide, but also how you get access to a wider range of treatments, including progesterone. My informed consent doctor is willing to prescribe it
<em>
if I want it
</em>
, regardless of the foot dragging of wpath and certainly regardless of the DSM. No mental health diagnosis necessary, just &#34;oh, you are an adult who has goals? Then you can take this medication if you understand the risks&#34;. That&#39;s the goal, and the barrier is medical gatekeeping, not some randos wanting GD removed from the DSM.

First there are people in this very thread arguing to take GD out of the DSM so it&#39;s not some fringe shit. It got taught to all 200 some students who will be therapists, who may someday be working on WPATH, as the right thing to do in my Masters in social work program. So this push not only exists but it exists in the circles of power.
</p>
<p>
For your entire last paragraph having GD in the DSM has nothing to do with any of that. How many times do I have to say that I don&#39;t support mandating therapy for anything. If you just want to go IC and never even look at a therapist more power to you I support you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m talking about progesterone here because these WPATH standards say it isn&#39;t recommended to be prescribed to ANYONE trans because they only looked at information on physical health. Anecdotally progesterone had a profoundly positive impact on my girlfriend&#39;s mental health. It&#39;s incredibly irresponsible of WPATH to not take the mental health effect into account and in turn will be causing transfeminine people more problems in accessing progesterone because &#34;well I&#39;m not really comfortable prescribing it, the WPATH doesn&#39;t recommend it&#34;
</p>
<p>
Your such a great example of the propaganda that&#39;s been working to 100% completely untie GD from mental health.
</p>
<p>
You do know it&#39;s possible to live in a world where there isn&#39;t gatekeeping to transition or to call yourself trans but still let people with GD talk to a therapist about GD.
</p>
<p>
I have my MSW. I work next to psychiatrists, fellows, med students, LCSWs. I worked my ass off to get into this field to have conversations with these people that hey, don&#39;t lock transition up behind mental health care, not all trans people need therapy, some do want therapy to talk through their shit, no not all problems a trans person has stems from being trans, that people with severe GD and trans people without GD can have very different experiences as a trans person.
</p>
<p>
People want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Yeah the mental health field has been very shitty to people with GD and trans people historically. We don&#39;t have to burn it to the ground though and pretend there is no mental health component for even a single trans person or person with GD. We can fight to stop gatekeeping but to keep access open to therapy FOR THOSE WHO WANT IT.

What the fuck do you know about my position on GD? I haven&#39;t given it to you. You have made a whole heap of unfounded (and completely incorrect) assumptions here.
</p>
<p>
On topic: Wpath have made these proposed guidelines
<em>
with GD in the DSM!
</em>
That is all you need to know to completely disprove your whole fucking thesis here. Having it in the DSM doesn&#39;t stop the problem you are complaining about! No trans rights organisation I have ever heard of has suggested trans people shouldn&#39;t have access to mental health care. This is a total straw person.
</p>
<p>
If all you are arguing is the wpath is a bullshit organisation I&#39;m with you all the way. They make shit guidelines that hurt trans people. Nothing to do with DSM or whatever weird shit is going on at your workplace, or apparently in this thread (I can&#39;t see it, so if you want to convince me that there are a significant amount of trans people wanting to redefine distress or dissociation related to gender incongruence as something other than a mental health problem, you are gonna have to show me. All I see is you assuming things about every single person you talk to that are completely untrue).

I&#39;m arguing on behalf of real fucking people, open your damn eyes to the diversity of the world. You&#39;re right that no trans rights org is explicitly saying &#34;trans people shouldn&#39;t be able to access healthcare&#34; but a lot of trans rights orgs also don&#39;t have a fucking clue how the internal workings of the mental health field and the responsibility we have to our clients. Trans rights orgs are saying take GD out of the DSM, just Google it you&#39;ll hit a fucking wall of it. The code of ethics of the NASW requires me to advocate on behalf of my clients. I have seen real life people who want therapy and have had it offered to be billed under different conditions as right now the diagnosis of GD
<em>
could
</em>
lead to discrimination by insurance companies going forward, but specifically want their time in treatment billed under GD as they don&#39;t morally feel ok receiving a service for one reason but then reporting they went for it for a different reason, even if it would protect them from discrimination.
</p>
<p>
It also doesn&#39;t matter how large or small of a problem this is, I&#39;m required to advocate for my clients regardless. And it wasn&#39;t my workplace, it was my University that pushed to get it removed. A top 20 program for getting your master&#39;s in social work. Social workers make up ~40% of therapists. It&#39;s very very concerning to have a part of their education be &#34;hey GD needs to be taken out of the DSM just like homosexuality was.&#34; The things cis &#34;allies&#34; do in the field can be pretty terrifying for truscum and tucutes simultaneously.

just wanted to let you know, Salmacian isn&#39;t really nonbinary. even cisgender people can be Salmacian.

I&#39;m not really well informed on terminology, but I&#39;d have thought Salmacian is by definition nonbinary. How can it be otherwise? I specific subset of nonbinary I can understand.

Salmacian just means that you desire a mixed genital set or sex traits, it doesn&#39;t have any implications as to your gender identity.
</p>
<p>
People can be cisgender and Salmacian. A lot of people have binary gender identities and are Salmacian.
</p>
<p>
Sex isn&#39;t binary to begin with, it&#39;s bimodal. There is a lot of variations within and outside of the norm inherently.

Can&#39;t say I understand that, but are you aware of any accepted definitions of these terms?

<p>
Have you looked though this document to see if/where they discuss Salmacian?

for HRT they&#39;ve just ctrl+c / ctrl+v the guidelines from Hembree 2017. Which.... whatever. Those guidelines are the most thoroughly researched and most widely accepted currently (even though I have major fucking problems with them)

<p>
100-200 pg/mL is standard. Lots of clinicians go higher. Fighting this right now is pointless

injections are mentioned in table 4

This kind of sums it up for me
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Although there are anecdotal reports of progesterone use for breast development and mood management, there is currently insufficient evidence that potential benefits of progesterone administration outweighs the potential risks
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There&#39;s no good research so you&#39;re not having it. They could have just as easily gone the other way and said
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<em>
potential risks
</em>
of progesterone administration outweighs the
<em>

</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Its the same thing.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s no good research for just about everything HRT related, and could at least acknowledge that and give doctors more freedom to fit HRT to the individual which is what many are doing anyway.

Agree. They are the same thing. Medicine as a field tends to be very cautious and conservative, especially with shit that theoretically might end up in textbooks. On the other hand, most physicians (at least the ones I&#39;ve worked with in my career, which is mostly radiologists, neurosurgeons, can&#39;t speak on endocrinologists) understand this, and are willing to go &#34;off label&#34; if they think it will benefit the patient.

That&#39;s under Parenteral, though it only lists IM and not SC.

It seems to be largely copied from the 2017 Endocrine Society guidelines though with less cypro and more spiro.

to be fair EV and EC are &#34;for intramuscular injection only&#34; so they definitely can&#39;t recommend SC and then claim to be &#34;evidence based&#34;

AAAAND once agian nothing explicit on injectables outside of a table with a recommended weekly IM dose, no mention of subcutaneous injections anywhere. I really feel like the people doing studies, reviewing the studies, and making recommendations are incredibly disconnected from the community. I genuinely wonder if alot of people who work in this area give a shit or if they are just doing it for the professional clout/because it&#39;s trendy.
</p>
<p>
There really needs to be some work done looking at the intersection that having access to a reasonable, preferred method of hormone administration plays in mental health. It&#39;s really hard to feel healthy and in control when you have no say over the method of hormone administration. I think there&#39;s alot of people doing DIY because their doctor solely uses a standards book as an absolute rule over actually listening to their patients.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s so many valid reasons for preference aswell, maybe they just don&#39;t want to deal with patches and their tendency to get gross or fall off. Maybe taking pills daily is an annoying dysphoria trigger which could be mitigated by only being reminded of the hormones once a week. Maybe it&#39;s easier for someone to stay on track with their dosing. Maybe IM are frightening and have too high perceived risk for some people but subcutaneous would be totally doable. There&#39;s so many reasons and it&#39;s quite annoying hearing these things trivialized when brought up, the doctor needs to remember their patient is the one who has to deal with the administration and there&#39;s alot more that happens after you write the prescription.

Hormone research is competently missing the psychological side of things. Keep the levels low so we don&#39;t risk breast cancer, totally missing the suicide instead.

if it were trendy, wouldn&#39;t hospital and university administrators be pushing for these studies? Because they&#39;re not. Clinicians, students, and professors have to fight extraordinary hard to get the ball rolling on

Why is there a whole section for “eunuch” identified individuals?  Does anyone know someone who identifies as a Eunuch, in this century?
</p>
<p>
I like the non-binary section.  I like that it points out how a “real-life” test is ridiculous, especially for enby folks.

I know close to 20 eunuchs....

Actually, it was because of a eunuch sub that I found this post...

I am AMAB &gt; enby. There are plenty within my community who identify as eunuchs.

yep they announced the enunch section sometime back this summer and I&#39;ve been fuming ever since. No disrespect to people who identify that way, but &#34;eunich&#34; is not a gender role the way  &#34;woman&#34; or &#34;enby&#34; or &#34;man&#34; is. Seriously, I don&#39;t want to be uncompassionate, but it&#39;s the world professional association for TRANSGENDER health and that&#39;s what they should be focusing on. If eunuchs need a SoC, they can go found their own equivalent of WPATH to make that SoC
</del>
</p>
<p>
<del>
big edit:
</del>
</p>
<p>
<del>
1. Go actually read the draft, because it&#39;s fairly nuanced and balanced in my opinion. The section on eunuchs is here:
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jsD-MA5qdyPbC0Xmdpq56n359PcLFb3e/view?usp=drivesdk">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jsD-MA5qdyPbC0Xmdpq56n359PcLFb3e/view?usp=drivesdk</a>
</del>
</p>
<p>
<del>
2. I&#39;m NOT saying that enunchs don&#39;t deserve care, or shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously. I&#39;m saying I think the care of that population is, by and large, beyond the scope of WPATH
</del>
</p>
<p>
<del>
To the best of my knowledge most enunchs don&#39;t identity as trans and don&#39;t consider themselves NB. Arguments on if &#34;enuch&#34; is a gender could probably go on for days. While some of them identity as asexual or aromantic, most of them are not really part of the LGBTQ+ community. My point is that the SoC for MtE individuals should be written by a group that actually understands their needs, not a group that understands what trans people need and then shoehorns enunchs into some pseudo-transgender diagnosis
</del>
</p>
<p>
okay, another edit: I&#39;m more and more sure that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about here. Apparently the discourse has moved on significantly since the last time I knew anything, and I&#39;m going to just stop posting and listen

It&#39;s really, really not.
</p>
<p>
I have had friends die or be hospitalized trying to get their care through less than savory means. Recently, with surgeons like Dr. Crane and Dr. Davis, and with the help of Judy Van Maasdam (who was instrumental in getting WPATH to recognize AMAB individuals with genital dysphoria) more and more of us are being able to reach our goals safely and affordably - WPATH did that. I, and many within my community, identify within the enby/trans umbrella. Many of us do not identify as men, though some still do. Some do identify as eunuchs, gomers, nullos, and some are even intersex.

The biggest take away from my comment is that people AMABwGD identify in many different ways - including as trans or enby. Hell, I have even met those within my community who identify as trans women and eunuchs!
</p>
<p>
Many eunuchs (as well as gomers and nullos) identify as non-binary or trans. From my experience, few identify as cis men - but it is not unheard of.

Presume the Eunuch bit has been added because the surgeons who perform trans female/5transfemme genital surgeries are getting approached by eunuch-identifying men requesting orchiectomy/penectomy surgeries?  And said surgeons are wanting to make some cash from this market but it’s not clear where they stand legally, so a set of WPATH standards of care for M-t-castrate (MtX?) will likely lead to a similar pathway to the existing one for trans people (ie the therapist letter/psych sign off that is required for surgeries in most countries - not sure what’ll happen re: the hormonal suppression for a year though!)
</p>
<p>
The vast majority of WPATH exec members are doctors and the incoming president is a surgeon, so unsurprisingly they are looking out for the interests of surgeons performing these kinds of ops (mostly urologists and plastics specialists, with the occasional OB/GYNAE).
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if WPATH have had a ‘stakeholder’ consultation process before the public comment but if not, they should probably be aiming for that going forward - it’s normal in other areas of specialist healthcare to have focus groups/scrutiny panels from a patient perspective.

MtE is what is in the draft, though I&#39;ve not come across it anywhere before.

From the draft this seems to be both about harm reduction, and allowing them to meet their gender goals.

<p>
Yes, but also because when Eunuchs get turned down by physicians they occasionally turn to &#34;cutters&#34; or attempt self-surgery, which is bad for everyone involved. Overall, the Pt is better off getting his orchi in an OR than a back alley somewhere.

No, just no. Money isn&#39;t an adequate motivation to stay in medicine. You don&#39;t make it through 4 years of med school (which is brutal) and 4+ years of residency (which is also brutal - seriously, try being on call, it&#39;s awful) just so you can earn a relatively big paycheck. You make it through med school, residency, fellowship, etc. because of your care and compassion for your patients
</p>
<p>
Especially in 2021 the healthcare system is in no need of new patients, trans or cis. Everyone is up to their eyeballs, taking extra shifts for minimal compensation, just trying to keep things functional. Manipulating standards of care just to bring a few more patients in the door.... definitely not happening

I’m sure the vast majority of HCP aren’t particularly motivated by money (although obviously medical school results in a lot of student debt) but there absolutely are surgeons in the plastics/cosmetic/aesthetics field who actively advertise for patients and seek to maximise their income stream by identifying demand and becoming supply.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t take much time on the trans surgeries subreddit to see that like the general cosmetic/aesthetic surgery sector, not everyone who has chosen to work in this field is doing so with patient satisfaction as their primary motivator. Sadly.
</p>
<p>
And yes, while most primary and secondary care clinicians have been working like superheroes to get us through covid, and many tertiary clinicians have temporarily redeployed to help them, some quaternary clinicians have been able to work as usual between lockdowns, and some have been stuck unable to work much at all due to resources being commandeered for covid.
</p>
<p>
Pointing out that some surgeons are motivated by factors beyond pure patient satisfaction is not a slight on all HCPs globally, nor all surgeons globally, it’s not even a slight on all surgeons performing genital reconstruction surgery!
</p>
<p>
I’m sad that you assumed it was.

right, but from what I understand most enunchs aren&#39;t after plastic, reconstructive, aesthetic or cosmetic procedures. They&#39;re after an orchi and maybe a penectomy. Neither are a lucrative procedure, and both are being performed in tiny numbers. I don&#39;t think it matters how inclusive the WPATH SoC is, nobody stands to get rich by adding a chapter on caring for enunchs.
</p>
<p>
(and yes I know about scumbags like Dr. Kathy Rumer, and I think my point still stands)

oh come on ffs! WPATH and a good socket wrench both occupy the same space in my heart - they&#39;re useful tools to help accomplish bigger goals. If you leave the socket wrench outside in the rain it&#39;ll rust and no longer do it&#39;s job well; the same it true for WPATH
</p>
<p>
sorry I have room in my head to both dislike the way WPATH has been run in the past, and also think that they can make better decisions in the future - especially with input from the community

The WPATH doesn&#39;t mandate insurance to do anything. If anything these changes make it seem more eclectic and will likely make insurance not want to cover it

it doesn&#39;t mandate anything but it&#39;s what they look to in order to determine what they actually have to cover. The reason most insurance companies now cover vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, and metoidioplasty is because of V7 of the SoC. V8 is really a chance to get more insurance to cover FFS and BA, etc.

I was really hoping that this could help push for coverage for FFS but I&#39;m not sure that the surgery chapter looks like much help here?
</p>
<p>
They definitely acknowledge FFS and the benefits but I was hoping to hear something like &#34;for many individuals FFS is a necessary procedure in order to reduce dysphoria to manageable levels&#34; or something.
</p>
<p>
I really want someone to back me up. I need people to understand that I&#39;m not trying to look like Kim Kardashian, this is not for fun, and this is not cosmetic. I just want to undo the damage testosterone has done to me and alleviate my dysphoria, which is triggered by specifically my face basically every time I look in a mirror.
</p>
<p>
I just started learning about all this stuff over the last year. I&#39;ve learned a lot about the current state of things, but the WPATH&#39;s influence in prior versions is not something I&#39;m familiar with.

yes, this. This is my plan, and the more people do similarly the better the chance it succeeds is

Idk, this literally reports a higher regret rate for something like vaginoplasty than in the past. If anything insurance will not take that as a good sign

If I worked at an insurance company I would use that argue to reconsider covering it to save the company money

that certainly gets tried, but what&#39;s been happening is that somebody else counters with &#34;but the leading professional organization has seen that stat too and STILL says that sex reassignment is medically necessary for GD, so we have to cover it or NCQA will ding our rating&#34;
