Basically wondering if anyone else has had this issue or a similar one. I have an appointment with my docs in 3 days but im wondering if is should call them to try and get in earlier if this can become an issue. Also due to having Crohn&#39;s disease im at higher risk for infection ðŸ™ƒ edit: PS the picture is upside down

What does that quiet voice inside tell you to do? If you are concerned, call the office. That is what they are there for. They gave you post-op instructions, right? If you call and it turns out there is a problem, you did the right thing. If you call and it turns out to be nothing to worry about, you still did the right thing.

Very much agreed with
<a href="/u/ashleyjm" rel="nofollow">u/ashleyjm</a>
, it&#39;s much better to ask and find out that you&#39;re okay than to not ask and wish that you had asked earlier.

This this this!  And many offices have online portals where you can send a picture.  At the very minimum, Contact them, send them the photo and describe whatâ€™s going on.

Good point. NYU does have a MyChart portal and in our last vaginoplasty surgery webinar earlier this month, they provided a slide with nearly this exact information.

Try medihoney. Its nedical manuka honey meant to be applied topically. Heals dehiscence.

I suspect local infection vs early dehiscense. Apply antibiotic ointment, keep very clean, and keep pressure off of the suture line.  Warm sitz baths may help if not too long.  Pat dry well and antibiotic ointment.

I suffer from keloids since age 26, I know any surgery/trauma to the skin can cause keloids, if you are predisposed.  Dermatologist can tell you for sure &amp; can give injections to make swelling go down.  From experience, after years of patience, most my keloids have gone flat on their own making the keloids invisible, but some are still there after 20 years, so prevention is best.  Mauling keloids does absolutely no good.  They&#39;ll come back good as new, maybe even bigger.  I&#39;ve done it.  Keloids are not like acne.  Nothing but blood is going to come out &amp; mauling can damage your surgeon&#39;s work. Best thing to do is leave keloids alone, just keep your clothes on.  Thank God keloids are rare on the face.

I can&#39;t remember what I tried, but the dermatologist did give me injections to reduce swelling.
