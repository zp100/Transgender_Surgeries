I am more than happy with Dr Rossi, and honestly if I was from Argentina I wouldn’t think twice about selecting him.

Sure and then do what I did and go read this thread that gives additional context to that whole situation.

Did I nominate Dr. Rossi for sainthood?  No.
</p>
<p>
Do I deny that the initial issue happened with him?  No.
</p>
<p>
But there was a LOT more to that story than was initially told, and people deserve to hear all the information and decide for themselves, like I did.  I knew about the issue. I was concerned about it. But based on discussions with many of his clients including one I know personally, I decided to go with him.  And I didn&#39;t regret it.
</p>
<p>
All surgeons have problems. Complications are an unfortunate aspect to getting surgery. But to raise this particular issue about Dr. Rossi WITHOUT also giving the extenuating circumstances is lying by omission.
</p>
<p>
I have no comment about Dr. DiMaggio because I know nothing about him. He wasn&#39;t in my shortlist.  But I did my due diligence with Dr. Rossi and made my decision on the whole of the information available, not just one story.

I had FFS with Di Maggio last year, I would definitely not recommend him. I&#39;ve been left with scarred deformed ears on which I had a revision last month back in Australia, the surgeon said the surgical technique used was not good. The revision did slightly improve things but still my ears look ridiculously out of proportion and my ear lobes still deformed.
</p>
<p>
I had a facelift as part of the FFS due to being in my late 40&#39;s and one of my ears ended up as a pixie ear (google it and you&#39;ll see) and my other earlobe was deformed out at a 45 degree angle. As well as that me ears were stretched in length but significantly reduced in width so that they are now no longer in proportion. So I know sometimes things don&#39;t always come out 100% when it comes to surgery but that&#39;s three things just with my ears, so that&#39;s not bad luck it&#39;s just awful surgical technique and it makes me sad to look at me ears or to touch them as the scarring and ridiculousness of them is just what I&#39;m stuck with for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
I had my ears repierced a couple of weeks ago as the holes had closed and I didn&#39;t want to get them pierced again till after I tried to have my ears fixed. The guy who did the piercing said I basically don&#39;t have proper ear lobes.
</p>
<p>
When the bandages come off a few days after the surgery I could see Di Maggio wince when he saw my ears as they were obviously not good but at no point did he ever mention the issue. I find this entirely disappointing that he wasn&#39;t willing to say oh I&#39;ve messed up your ears but let&#39;s come up with a solution. He just ignored it hoping I wouldn&#39;t notice.
</p>
<p>
Di Maggio also tried to pressure me into carrying most of the US $40000 in cash with me to Argentina (he said no one usually checks at the airport) and when I refused and said I&#39;d bring only $10000 (which I was not happy about doing) he tried adding on money to the bill stating some BS about tax that also needed to be paid. Which I guess would be true if the original invoice was going to be essentially cash in hand let&#39;s not tell the Argentinian tax people.
</p>
<p>
When I had my initial skype consultation with him I told him one of things I really didn&#39;t like about my face was my chin dimple. It certainly wasn&#39;t as prominent as Kirk Douglas&#39; dimple but still I didn&#39;t like it and wanted it gone. So the morning after the surgery just before I was discharged (I was promised two nights in hospital which became one without anyone explaining why, presumably to save Di Maggio money) one of the lovely women who act as Di Maggio&#39;s patient coordinators got a mirror to show me what I looked like and guess what the dimple was still there. A week or so later when I saw him I asked about the dimple and he was very vague and wouldn&#39;t say why it was still there but did admit it now looked worse but he&#39;d bring me into the clinic and inject some filler to even things out. I asked if this was permanent and he said no it&#39;d only last months not years. At no point did he ever contact me to arrange this before I left Argentina.
</p>
<p>
Another annoyance was after the initial removal of the bandages (it could have been in the check up a few days after this) I was told I&#39;d need to go to a pharmacy and get a facial compression garment. He wrote down what I needed in Spanish and said show them that. I was still really really tired and weak after the surgery (and on my own) but I walked to the specific pharmacy I was told to go to and ended up there for a over an hour as it was so busy and got shouted at by one of the staff as I was in the wrong queue who was annoyed I didn&#39;t understand what she was saying. As I recall it ended up costing about US $15 now why can&#39;t Di Maggio just provide this even if he wants to charge me an additional $15 over the $40000 I&#39;d already paid him. It&#39;s just really unfair and cheap to expect your weak patients to go and buy it especially when I was self conscious about how swollen and bruised my face was.
</p>
<p>
Ignoring the ears and chin dimple issues I don&#39;t feel I got $40000 worth of value from my FFS, I saw a friend a few months later and she said she couldn&#39;t really see any significant change in my face and if she didn&#39;t know I&#39;d had surgery she probably wouldn&#39;t even have noticed. Which is something as we&#39;re both emergency nurses so really quite observant in noticing changes.
</p>
<p>
Before the surgery the quote I was given listed a number of things he was going to do and being a nurse I know that what is planned often isn&#39;t what is done on the actual day. When I asked Di Maggio after what he&#39;d done he was really quite vague so I&#39;m guessing he skipped things that he said he&#39;d do and that I&#39;d paid for.
</p>
<p>
Overall my impression of Di Maggio is that money is more important than patient satisfaction and he&#39;s more than willing to ignore surgical issues presumably as it&#39;s less hassle and saves him time and money in having to fix things. It also concerns me that my Australian surgeon said the technique he used was amateurish.

Well the quality I got was at the bottom of the hill not just downhill. And yeah I paid a lot and the US $40000 didn&#39;t even include flights from Australia, accommodation etc.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t realise him not doing things he&#39;s been paid to do is something that he&#39;s famous for, it doesn&#39;t surprise me as based on my experience he is pretty dodgy.
</p>
<p>
Nor had I heard he&#39;s shitty towards older non passing girls, I am in my late 40&#39;s but had no issues passing before the surgery. Which is just as well as if I was really relying on the FFS then I&#39;d be screwed and with no money to go elsewhere for a second FFS.

You know if I&#39;d just lost $40000 for a FFS that didn&#39;t do much then I&#39;d be annoyed but it&#39;s the fact he ruined my ears, there&#39;s no way they&#39;ll ever look normal again and for that I&#39;m way more than annoyed.
</p>
<p>
I could never recommend him as he&#39;s dodgy on so many levels not just when it came to what he did to me surgically.
</p>
<p>
And yeah if he was charging $10000 and that&#39;s all I had maybe it&#39;d be worth the risk but obviously he&#39;s not charging cheap prices anymore.

Are you seriously asking if I&#39;m mistaking that I travelled all the way from Australia to Argentina and had surgery with a different surgeon cos somehow I&#39;m a bit dumb.
</p>
<p>
I paid 40K with Di Maggio, if you think he only charges 18K then that&#39;s not my issue.
</p>
<p>
And stating any surgeon will do FFS for 18K makes no sense, that means nothing as it totally depends on what they&#39;re doing.

Perhaps there’s some confusion over USD vs AUD?

I don&#39;t think so, I&#39;m pretty sure in every post I&#39;ve written US $40000 then just 40K or $40000 as I&#39;ve already established the currency.
</p>
<p>
I didnt write it in Aussie dollars as most people have no clue what that&#39;d be worth. And anyway it was US $40000 I paid as that&#39;s the currency the quote was in and the amount I transferred into Di Maggio&#39;s American bank account.
</p>
<p>
In Aussie dollars I think it was about $65000 at the time.

I’ve no idea. I’d thought he was a lot cheaper, but I can’t say I pay too much attention.
