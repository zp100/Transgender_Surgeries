I
<em>
really

love the definition of the clitoral hood and labia minora that I&#39;ve seen across Sutin patients, it&#39;s very naturalistic. I&#39;ve scheduled myself for him soon!

Glad to hear that, Dr.Sutin has had the best hands down results I&#39;ve seen anywhere I&#39;ve researched , i looked everywhere in the world and their results, and Thailand PAI was the best aswell as very affordable. and to learn early that PAI taught everyone else in Thailand, the choice after seeing results was very easy. Very glad i did. ill be coming back for other things in the future.Also if ur booking a hotel use the Oakwood Thonglor the staff is really great and a very short walk to a American type grocery store. i used residence at Thonglor 1st but changed hotels because i tested positive for covid and they wanted a additional 3000thbt per night to clean. we said no way and went to the Oakwood Thonglor very glad we did.

Hi I’ve got a few questions 1. Does suttin use the same method as dr Suporn 2. How long did you have to wait from putting the deposit to get the actual surgery  3. How much does he charge in Thai bait ?  Thanks so much in advance love your result x

i believe Dr. Sutin uses a better method based on the results i have seen, the other Drs, like Suporn and Chettawit Kamol etc were taught by Preecha where i found Sutin. who handles out of the foreigner&#39;s i believe that Sutins technique is better but thats what my research lead me to see. urs may be different, i had my surgery in 3 weeks from the time i put my deposit to the scheduled date of surgery and the people are SOOO nice,  paid 10230 dollars USD for my surgery, im slightly overweight by their standards, in Thai baht it was about 355k Thai baht roughly. hope that helps. ill be doing a whole right up coming shortly

This is her wife. I just wanted to say that you can have a full kitchen at Oakwood, which makes things much easier with the grocery store. You can actually cook. Everything to cook with is included. There is a fridge and microwave in the hospital room. If I had known, I would have brought groceries with us.

The Clinic has certain hotels they use depending on where u are coming from. I&#39;m at the Oakwood in little America , it&#39;s geared towards us westerners but there are other places. I do not recommend Residence at Thonglor at ALL.. Hope this helps

I hope u get everything u want , he&#39;s a great man. I cannot wait to see him in again on a few days. PAI as far as I&#39;m concerned is the e best. Not only results but affordability.

They had a couple they recommended. We started in Residence of Thonglor, but moved to Oakwood. Much more convenient! Having an entire western-style shopping mall has made life so more convenient. There is also an equivalent to Dollar tree right here. Places for pampering (hair, nails), restaurants, computer store and grocery. Even a McDonald&#39;s around the corner. It&#39;s all within a short walk. We were relying on 7-eleven, but now we can cook. Oakwood has full kitchens in the rooms. If coffee is important to you then they have real coffee makers in Oakwood too. That&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll get a real cup of coffee here.
