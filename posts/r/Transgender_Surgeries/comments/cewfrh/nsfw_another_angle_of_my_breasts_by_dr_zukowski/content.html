Thank you for this. I&#39;m going for my BA in two weeks and nervous as fucking hell. They look amazing!
</p>
<p>
What was your first week home like? Pain level wise. Did you go under the muscle?

Omg I was very nervous bc last time I went under it was early in transition and I broke both arms in CO and had to deal with transphobic asshole doctors misgendering me and not trying to comfort me, once I got to the hospital tho the nurse who was taking care of me was so nice and caring tho ðŸ’– but yeah my pain post op and for 5 hours after surgery was worse than my two completely broken arms.. it was the worst pain in my life, I went under the muscle with the implants too but Dr. Zukowski said I was in so much pain is because of how fit and muscular my chest wall was, so if you arenâ€™t rather muscular in the chest then Iâ€™m sure the pain level will be very manageable, mine tho was at a 9 and I was balling for hours.. and I consider myself to have quite a high pain tolerance. Again tho my pain level was very unusual for a breast augmentation. Some people only need over the counter ibuprofen and some need heavy narcotics and muscle relaxers like me.

It still depends on each individual! ðŸ’– and trust me the pain may have been bad, (like worse ever) but nothing compares to seeing my boobs this morning for the first time and seeing undoubtably a females chest ðŸ’– and I was mega jacked before transition, not nearly as much anymore but that may also have impacted the pain. But just make sure your doc is giving you narcotics and muscle relaxers like Valium or else sleeping is probs near impossible especially if u donâ€™t like sleeping at a 45Â° - 70Â° angle on ur back. and trust me it brought the pain down from a 9 to a 1 -2 level but u just have to stay on top of dosing them because the pain can come back quick, especially waking up in the middle of the night, itâ€™s good to maybe set an alarm and wake yourself up to dose rather than to wake up a couple hours too late with a shock of pain. The worse of the pain really doesnâ€™t last long tho only the day of surgery, night of and most of the next day. Hope this info helps :) also make sure your doc (if theyâ€™re not super experienced with trans breast augmentations) that the pain levels on average are worse than cis females because of our thicker chest walls!!

I&#39;m specifically seeing a trans doctor for this, so I think I&#39;m good on that front. I will show them this message however and ask them to give me a bit more than I need just in case.

Iâ€™m excited for u! And awesome I think for breast augs it is important to have a trans experienced surgeon especially if the individual has abnormal width or extra muscle on their breasts.
