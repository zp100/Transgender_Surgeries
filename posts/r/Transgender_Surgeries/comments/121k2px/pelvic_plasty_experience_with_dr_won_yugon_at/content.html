</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been about 5 months since I had my pelvic plasty in Seoul, South Korea - so I think it&#39;s a good time to share with you my experience (good and bad) living with my new hips. Excuse me if it takes quite some time to read, I tried to make it short.
</p>
<p>
Now, I&#39;m sure many of you can relate; as a transwoman who started HRT after puberty, there just isn&#39;t enough curve around the hip area. That&#39;s why I decided to get the surgery - to &#34;pass&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I had the procedure with
<a href="https://ostymeditech.com/" rel="nofollow">Dr Won ( 원유건 )
</a>
last October 2022, who is an orthopedic surgeon who invented the procedure. So what they do is they attach a pair of
<strong>
titanium implants
</strong>
(I got the 35mm ones, yes, you can choose the size) on your iliac crests, and
<strong>
silicone implants
</strong>
underneath to smoothen out the new protruding hip bone which is especially the case if you have low to average body fat percentage.
</p>
<p>
(If you&#39;re wondering how to get to the hospital, they actually pick you and send you back to the airport - at least for the main initial surgery in my experience (not sure about revisions, or the next time you visit). I had a difficult time looking for the driver and almost gave up waiting actually, but we eventually met after a couple of hours. He was a very nice, friendly old man.)
</p>
<p>
Before the surgery, they had me do x-rays and medical examinations to see if I was ready to not only go through the procedure but also to see if I had no problem being put under general anesthesia. It was so crowded, and it did take some time waiting in line to get checked - I&#39;d recommend going earlier.
</p>
<p>
Then I had to wait until around 2 in the afternoon for the surgery. (Like any other surgery that requires general anesthesia, you have to fast before surgery.)
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself was easy. But once I woke up from general anesthesia, I noticed I was shivering and my legs were shaking heavily (maybe it was cold in the operating room). And when I completely woke up I started feeling a little bit of pain, but more on discomfort because they had attached a urinary catheter, too, aside from the fresh stitches on both sides of my hips.
</p>
<p>
That night post-surgery, it was hard to move and I could only sleep. Most likely that the anesthesia had not wear off completely, I felt sleepy.
</p>
<p>
The next day, it felt very uncomfortable. The areas around the stitches felt tight and swollen. I was also feeling very weak.
</p>
<p>
But at that time, I had my FFS and BA scheduled the next week so I forced myself to get up and move my legs with walkers. My legs felt super heavy, but I managed to walk. They said that patients usually take 3 days before they can try walking assisted, but I guess being younger/fit do make a difference.
</p>
<p>
Also, I brought whey protein shakes and quercetin with bromelain supplements to help with my recovery. It seemed that it helped a lot, so I&#39;d highly recommend them if you&#39;re getting the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The pain was highly manageable, and I did not have to press the pain killer pump attached on the needle that many times. I think I did press it 3-4 times only, mostly after and during the first day post-surgery.
</p>
<p>
On the second day, it felt way better. So I continued to practice walking around the small private room with walker.
</p>
<p>
I forgot which day, I believe it was day 3 (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, if you also had it) that they start asking you to head to the physiotherapy room twice a day for treatment. I remember one of the treatment was they blow cold air on the incision area, it was quite cozy.
</p>
<p>
Oh, they also allowed me to remove the urinary catheter before I could easily visit the physiotherapy room. BUT I did not know how and it was the first time that I had that thing on me. So I asked the nurse to pull it out, it was a bad idea. I was quite surprised and got a little tense, so it hurt a little bit. And I freaked out when I realised I had some bleeding (lasted a few days, though it was nothing serious). I&#39;d highly suggest anyone to remove it yourself - just let go and don&#39;t tense up.
</p>
<p>
They also changed my incision dressings once every few days, it felt quite refreshing and reassuring that it&#39;s cleaned and healing.
</p>
<p>
On day 5 (or 6), I can start walking without the walker. Even though I could not walk too fast, it was easy enough to roam around the hospital. But my legs did get tired easily, walking for long distances was definitely impossible. It was either at day 7 or 8 post-op that I got discharged because I need to prepare for my FFS and BA. But to summerise, I had to wait 2 weeks to be able to walk at least 5,000 steps in one go comfortably.
</p>
<p>
Now, I must say that I&#39;m very satisfied with the result. You can refer to the photos attached,
<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuWvzrapeuhMjmIzkNCCQwQQYE4I" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
. Though it may not seem clear because I had to take the selfies myself, the result is actually quite dramatic if you see them in person (I was like a bamboo stick and now I got curves!). Though I have close family members who said that they are not wide enough, maybe because I currently have a 0.755 waist-to-hip ratio (0.7 would be best to look femininely hourglass).
</p>
<p>
However, sadly, as you can see I have quite obvious hip dips due to the new and wider titanium implants on my pelvic bones despite having the silicone implants placed.
</p>
<p>
At first Dr Won wanted to inject some fillers on my 2nd visit to the hospital (after 2 months post-surgery). But he insisted that I replace the soft silicone implants that I have right now, with a pair of custom hard silicone implants because I&#39;m quite skinny to begin with. So I will need to make my third visit soon, and hoping to get better and smoother result with less hip dips.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I&#39;m having excruciating pain that comes and goes since 1-month post-surgery, which has not gone away - it&#39;s already been 5 months post-op now and I still have it. I&#39;m known to have high pain tolerance, but this one is just too painful sometimes that I&#39;m limping from time to time. I still don&#39;t know why, and last time I visited they checked that everything was alright. I assume it has to do with the nerves or muscles. The pain mostly comes from my left hips (silicone implant area), and there are times where it hurts too on the right side though seldom (silicone implant area too). It&#39;s frustrating that I cannot run and do my legs in the gym due to the pain that comes.
</p>
<p>
Good thing is the titanium implants are perfectly placed - healing well, no pain.
</p>
<p>
Since you&#39;ve read this long, I&#39;m sure you you&#39;ve got a better picture about the procedure. But please note that everyone will have different experiences. Because I know not everyone have the same issue as I have right now, and all surgeries come with a risk. Personally, I&#39;d still do the surgery again despite knowing the possible risks.
</p>
<p>
(And I really do hope replacing the silicone implants with the new hard ones will help eliminate the pain. I will make an update later in the middle of the year after the revision surgery.)
</p>
<p>
And if any of you are wondering, at that time, the procedure cost me 27,083,000 Korean Won after they offer me before/after photo discount (I asked to pay in KRW at that time, which was equivalent to 19,701 USD). And that&#39;s before deducting tax refund you can claim in the airport (around 9%). The price includes airport pickup, hospitalisation, medicines, and the silicone implants.
</p>
<p>
And I have people (and closed ones) ask me good questions recently that I also want to share here:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Currently, they lower the price to 16,000 USD + VAT, including the new hard silicone implants - with Dr Won. And 13,000 USD + VAT with Dr Choi (his colleague who is a plastic surgeon). They told me since the beginning that they are trying to make the surgery more accessible, and it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s true. (Yes, still as expensive as getting SRS!)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The revision that I will have later to replace the silicone implants (from soft to hard) cost 2K USD (EDIT: now they mention it&#39;s around 3K USD, including general hospital fees) for a pair of implants*, while surgery and hospitalisation are free. I hope you&#39;ll find it helpful if you had the surgery in 2022 or way before. But if you are a new patient, you will most likely get the new hard ones - so you don&#39;t have to worry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
IF you ever consider to get wider titanium* implants (a full revision required), it will be 10K USD. Why? Because initially they cannot put too wide of titanium implants on the pelvic bone (mine are 35mm) since your skin will be stretched, so you will need a second surgery to get... let&#39;s say a pair of 50mm titanium implants.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So with the new hard silicone implants (smaller and custom made), they see patients recover much faster than it was with the soft silicone implants (bigger and not as effective in eliminating hip dips) I currently have.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
And you don&#39;t have to worry about not being able to speak Korean. The staff and nurses can speak a little bit of English - I&#39;d recommend installing Papago for easier communication. While Dr Won (and other doctors you will meet) can speak English very well.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
(I would like to really thank
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MejaFoss/" rel="nofollow">Meja
</a>
who shared her experiences with me since she had her surgery way before me. You want to checkout her post if you have not.
</p>
<p>
And also William, the English coordinator, who has been there with me before and after the surgery - though we mostly communicate via email and chat, he responds even at night and always very helpful to answer any questions I have.)
</p>
<p>
P.S. I&#39;m getting my revision in May 25th 2023.
</p>
<p>
Update [20/04/2023]: I&#39;ve been experiencing the mentioned intense &#34;stretching/tearing&#34; pain on my left hip for the past 3 days and doesn&#39;t seem to stop any moment - worse than before. I haven&#39;t been able to sleep comfortably, let alone walk properly. And I have to press the area while I walk as it seems to help with the pain. At the moment, I suggest you to think twice before getting the surgery - don&#39;t want anyone experiencing this. Now I can only hope it gets better after revision.
</p>
<p>
Update [03/06/2023]: Got my silicone revision on the 25th of May, and also neuroplasty for herniated disc (found through MRI) on my arrival (24th) - quite stressful and a surprise because I really didn&#39;t expect to enter the operation room twice. Fortunately, everything seems to have gone well, though I still feel pain from time to time on my left hip (significantly a lot less often now). So the real cause of pain should be caused either by the herniated disc or the bigger pair of old silicone implants that stretched the nerve - the pain was still there after neuroplasty, but felt better post silicone revision the next day. And as of now 3rd of June, it still feels very tight on the right, since post silicone revision. So I&#39;ve been taking my time resting and recovering. Other than that, if you&#39;re wondering; the result of the revision seem to look far superior than before! Even though I still have my suture dressing on, I can see a smooth hip line - 100% big difference. As mentioned, I will write a new post on this in detail and attach some photos for you who are interested.

Thanks so much for this amazingly detailed post! I remember reading this doctor’s first article on this surgery a few years ago and being intrigued. Hearing a first hand account of the experience is a treat!
</p>
<p>
May I ask a few questions?
</p>
<p>
What, if any, are the long term risks/complications of the current surgery model?
</p>
<p>
Did you consider fat transfer, and if so, why did you choose implants?

Hi Elsierror, glad you find this helpful :)
</p>
<p>
They told me the main (titanium) implants could last forever, and I have my local orthopedic surgeon do an x-ray and was quite surprised by the procedure and how well it&#39;s placed - so I believe they are right.
</p>
<p>
But they did not mention anything about the old soft silicone implants when I had them, though the new ones which are custom-made, hard* silicone implants are way more durable and won&#39;t burst/rupture like the old ones - suitable for the hips and overcoming hip dips. (I&#39;ll 100% give an update after the revision.)
</p>
<p>
And yes I did consider BBL or fat transfer before, but I heard most of the fat transferred will be reabsorbed by the body - so it may look good at first but smaller a few months after. I got facial fat grafts, and it seems to work similarly.
</p>
<p>
Buttt the main reason would be because I want wider hips, just wider hourglass looking body from the front and back view - for butt thickness, we can work it out I guess XD

Thank you so much for reviewing ❤️❤️❤️ May I ask did the doctor told you the necessity to may change the types of silicon because of the hips dips or the filler to have more rounded shape of curvy hips before the initial surgery?
</p>
<p>
I mean I am wondering if they did told you the possibility to cause hipdips?

Np ❤️ Yes Dr Won told me the possibility of hip dips especially when patients are too skinny and choose too wide of titanium implants - and showed me pictures of before/after a few hours before my initial surgery. (Despite that, skinnier/ideal BMI patients benefit more from the surgery because the result will look more noticeable.)
</p>
<p>
So I went with his recommendations as I&#39;m sure he knows best - he told me he&#39;d inject fillers the next time I visit to smoothen out the result.
</p>
<p>
However, I assume he realized fillers weren&#39;t effective, so on my second visit (3 months post-op) he looked at my hips and adviced me to change the silicones to the new hard ones almost immediately.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a new procedure, personally I can understand why they want me to have a revision.
</p>
<p>
But on the other hand, it could also be due to the pain that I have been experiencing since 1 month post-op - the big old soft silicones might just not be for everyone. And they believe replacing them will solve the problems I have right now - which I hope so too.

Ohhh I wish if the Dr implants the hard one at the first surgery and not to do it again
</p>
<p>
I am sorry😭😭😭 I would say a bit of word about the happenings that  makes you to do revisions despite of the following Dr recommendation.  😭
</p>
<p>
Would you mind me to asking you if you considered shortening surgery for shoulders? and ribcage?

I know you aren&#39;t that long out but how do you feel about your ability to do daily functions like walking or going up and down stairs.
</p>
<p>
Did they mention anything about gym time and stretching?
</p>
<p>
Also do you have any lingering issues with nerve activity

The only issue I have personally is the pain that comes and goes mentioned, more often on the left side around the silicone implant area D:
</p>
<p>
(I did not have any lingering nerve or other issue before the surgery.)
</p>
<p>
When I&#39;m in pain, any leg movement becomes hard. And I&#39;d even be careful whenever I sit.
</p>
<p>
The pain could last a week or two. I could be fine the next week, but in pain again after. And it hasn&#39;t stopped. Stretching did seem to start the pain when I tried, so I have been avoiding any stretching especially on that area.
</p>
<p>
But the first month after surgery when I had not experienced this pain, or *even now when it doesn&#39;t hurt - I have no problem at all walking or going on stairs.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it&#39;s really nerve or muscle problem, but I&#39;m not sure - I hope the revision will fix it because I haven&#39;t heard other patients with similar situation other than normal inflamations.
</p>
<p>
They didn&#39;t mention gym time or stretching specifically. But they did recommend me to do a lot of exercises 2 months post-op.

Thank you for the super detailed answer. I had sciatica triggered by butt implants and I was debating on hip work. I hope the pain gets better for you.

Thank you, I wish you the same! Sciatica seems more serious than what I have, but sounds like they are similar kind of pain. I wish the best for you 🙏
</p>
<p>
If you ever decide to get this hip work, you could go without the silicone implants if you&#39;re worried - which I had really considered removing before. Unless you have lower bmi, the silicone implants would be needed to smoothen out the dips.

The initial results look a little funny but wow the revision looks incredible! Would you say it’s worth it? Did you stick with the 35mm plates? I can see how this would work perfectly with lipo+fat graft

Do you have a photo of what your hips looked like with the silicone implants in?

All the &#34;after&#34; photos I uploaded are with the silicone implants :) I think it&#39;s because they are big (and soft), they need them placed more to the back not directly under the new hips. That&#39;s why there are hip dips.
</p>
<p>
The new silicones I&#39;ll get later will be hard, and smaller in size. They said they eliminate the hip dips better (even better since they are custom-made), which I assume will be placed nearer below the titanium implants. So I&#39;m really looking forward to get them replaced.

Thank you for making this post.I&#39;ve been looking for this however there aren&#39;t a lot of pics which can make things look rather sketchy.
</p>
<p>
And how was it getting home with the implants were they detected at the airport if so how did you go about it?

Glad you find it helpful :)
</p>
<p>
I had no problem going home, though there was one time in the airport that the detector kept beeping and I had to tell them that I have a pair of implants inside. And they said &#34;ah, okay&#34; - that&#39;s it.

Are you feeling better now with the pain? And why is it that they put catheter in you?

Hi, thanks for asking. Sadly, the pain has gotten worse now as time went by and it hurts every time I move - can&#39;t go exercise and limping most of the time. Carrying things a little bit heavy like 5kg is a no go.
</p>
<p>
I went to one of the best renowned local hip-and-leg orthopedic surgeon twice and they mentioned there is really nothing wrong from their perspective, no spine/bone problem and titanium implants are well placed.
</p>
<p>
So the issue is really with the silicone implant - most probably the placement imo which causes nerve/muscle pain. I can&#39;t wait to get over with the pain - completely paid for the revision, though still feeling very concerned 😭
</p>
<p>
__ For the initial surgery, they put catheter in me because they need to put me under general anesthesia + walking on first day was incredibly difficult - legs felt very weak and heavy - though still possible with walkers.
</p>
<p>
Later for the revision, they said catheter is unnecessary (thank God🥹).
</p>
<p>
I will give you an update with a new post after my revision. They mentioned it will have shorter recovery time and help eliminate the hip dips much better.
</p>
<p>
And I don&#39;t want anyone going through the same pain as I have right now, which is very important if you&#39;re considering for the surgery - especially since it cost as much, or even more, as having SRS.

So sorry to hear that 😔
</p>
<p>
I hope it gets over really soon, I can’t imagine how would it feel like. I’m planning for this surgery this summer, I have pretty deep hip dips that bother me so much, I have tried exercising and it did not help, I also don’t have much fat to transfer there so I can’t think of anything else than implants there. But when I was in contact with William, he gave the impression that all the implants are the same size (100cc) but I might need more than that if it’s customized.

Owh, that&#39;s new to me, Dr Won and William mentioned the new hard silicone implants are custom-made so I also thought they have different sizes. I hope they can minimize or get rid of your hip dips. I&#39;m really curious how it&#39;ll turn out though.
</p>
<p>
When in summer are you planning to visit them? Maybe we could be surgery buddy XD  I&#39;m flying back on the 8th of June.

Hi Starrytouch!
</p>
<p>
I have recently come across yours and Meja’s post regarding Pelvic Plasty in South Korea. I am interested in getting this  done hence my research. You’ll be returning to S. Korea soon for your revision. I just wanted to wish you GOOD LUCK and I hope everything goes smoothly. All the best!

Hi Starrytouch,
</p>
<p>
I have just noticed your most recent update on your revision of the silicone implants. I kept coming back here every so often for the past three months to see if you had posted any updates but nothing! I didn’t receive any new notifications and today I just happened to notice the update on your revision (surgery) as you added it on to your original post. Thank you for the update! It’s August the 18th today, how are the pain levels in you left and right hip? Have they improved? Could you upload some photos for us to see? Also, did they actually show you the MRI scan of your ‘herniated disc’? I mean, could they have just said this to get more  money out of you by saying you needed the additional surgery?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it was good to hear from you :)

Hi Mysterious_Music1492 :)
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the late reply - I&#39;ve been wanting to write new updated post, but has been really busy with work and family related things.
</p>
<p>
Right now, there is no pain and I can do all the things I normally do just like pre-pelvic plasty.
</p>
<p>
However, I did experience fluid retention on my left hip implant area around 2 months after the revision (it was so big and swollen) but they told me it&#39;s normal for patients who&#39;ve had revision and it did went back to normal after 2 days. Plus I happened to stretch too much and experienced severe pain on my left hip again - though it&#39;s nothing serious, I took more rest and around a week and a half the pain went away. So it&#39;s all good now, happy with the result, and grateful I can go back to my daily routine :D
</p>
<p>
For the herniated disc, yes, Dr Won showed me the MRI result.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, I did doubt them since my 2 local orthopedics said I don&#39;t have it (seeing only X-ray scan). BUT after the herniated disc surgery, I still felt pain (though much better compared to before) - it was only after they replaced the implants that the pain was gone. So I believe the kind of silicone implants used do matter, which no one has to worry for future surgery.
</p>
<p>
Now, you&#39;re 100% right about them trying to get more money from patients, specifically the hospital. NOT William or Dr Won, but the &#34;legal/sales/consultant&#34; doctor there. I&#39;ll write more about this later and why it&#39;s better to only ask William for pricing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll make sure to write a new post by this week, with the result photos.

Hi Starrytouch!
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the late reply.
</p>
<p>
It’s good to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
So it’s been four months since your revision now. How is everything going? Are you still pain free?
</p>
<p>
Please could you upload a new photo/s of the results of your revision :)
</p>
<p>
Btw, about the new silicone implants that were used on you, the firmer (harder) ones, do you know where they are made??
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope all is well with you and that you are still satisfied with the results of your revision.
</p>
<p>
Take care :)

Hi im really interested in updated pictures after the revision. esp because hip dips and the slope at the top are my 2 biggest concerns (and seeing the pictures on the website for trans people this seems to be way worse often) so id like to know if there&#39;s a big difference now.
</p>
<p>
Also do you maybe know or have they talked about the transition from the waist to the hips why for some its more jarring than others and what could help that?

Hi, hopefully I can post an updated post by this weekend - with photos.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re looking to have a more hourglass figure, it&#39;s best to have 0.7 waist to hip ratio - mine is 0.765 to 0.787 depending on time of day for reference. If you want a more prominent hourglass result you can request for wider titanium implants from Dr Won.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the reason they can&#39;t put too wide of titanium implants is that they can&#39;t stretch our skin too much (so a revision is required later in the future, they asked 10k USD for *titanium implant* revision). Personally, I think it&#39;s not worth the investment for me since I have other priorities right now - and staying alone in the hospital getting cut up and stitched again is really NOT fun - unless you have lots of cash on hand ;)
</p>
<p>
Plus, last I asked they only have 1 size for the new silicone implant to smoothen out the hips which may likely worsen hip dips if you opt for wider titanium implants.
</p>
<p>
So it&#39;s best to discuss it with Dr Won so he can recommend you which size is best and look more &#34;natural&#34; or &#34;dramatic&#34;.

ah i think you misunderstood me. often the transition from the waist to the hips can be very jarring. like you have ur waist and suddenly a near 90 degree angle out or a very steep angle like you just put something under it without thinking about the transition being smooth and natural looking. this I noticed is more common in the mtf pictures. so yes a bigger one would make this worse. i am looking for a way to make the transition from waist to hiips more natural and smooth. and wondered after the revision and or after some time after the surgery if it gets better. and or if there&#39;s ways to improve it and or avoid it. and or how to know if your particular case will be like that. if I knew how to upload pictures on redditt id attach a example of both extremes (one where its done well IMO and one where its very obvious and done badly)
</p>
<p>
this as well as the hip dips. which is actually even rn my biggest concern as I think my hips are decent but I have big dips
