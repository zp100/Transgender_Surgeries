Hey, I&#39;m writing today for your support and connection. Around 3 weeks ago I had surgery (Peritoneal pull through).
</p>
<p>
Originally the operation went well, i was surprised at how good healing was going, very happy with my aesthetics as well. One night after dilation I started to bleed pretty heavily, and after that I started to pass gas through my vagina. Shortly after my discharge started to change color and what do you know-I have feces coming from my vagina. This was a lot to handle, mentally and physically.
</p>
<p>
Cut to 2 days, I am told to visit a stomach doctor here. He performed a small exam and confirmed I have a fistula about 2 cm into my vagina, and 2 mm wide. The next day I was admitted to the hospital to undergo surgery to try to repair the fistula. I woke up that night in immense pain, oscillating between shitting and throwing up while sweating, something I would describe as similar to an exorcism. 3 days in the hospital past and I slowly got better, no longer having extreme nausea, able to eat although still shitting blood. I am writing this about 10 days out from that surgery. 2 days ago I had a checkup with the doctors and they said everything looked extremely good, everyone was pleased. I was told today I should come in to get the packing and catheter out (for the second time).
</p>
<p>
Well..last night in my sleep I started to pass gas through my vagina. Now I am bleeding again, and the stool is present as well. The fistula repair did not work. I feel really devastated, my mental health feels shook. I don&#39;t know how my body could handle more surgeries, more time spent in the hospital and more pain. I don&#39;t want this to be the reason I am unable to continue, but I&#39;d be lying if I said it wasn&#39;t incredibly hard. The thought of having an ilestomy is terrfying.

I&#39;m so sorry that you have to go through this ðŸ˜¢ I&#39;m going through this too. I have two fistulas after my surgery ðŸ˜¢ Most likely they will have to make stoma. Then you will wait for several months for fistula to stop inflammating and repeat the surgery to close fistula. With stoma it has a lot more chances to heal properly. Don&#39;t worry tho, stoma isn&#39;t painful or anything, just a bit annoying. I&#39;m waiting for mine to stop inflammating and hopefully I&#39;ll get my surgery soon and will be able to get rid of stoma. We will get through this. I wish you the quick and easy recovery.

thanks for your response. It&#39;s nice to hear from someone who is facing similar complications but I&#39;m sorry to hear it.
</p>
<p>
The stoma surgery wasn&#39;t  painful? how long have you had yours? Are you able to dilate?
</p>
<p>
I heard another girl saying she had to permenantly have a stoma, im worried about this

It wasn&#39;t painful for me. I&#39;m having mine for almost three months already. I was told that we will try to close fistula in few weeks. It&#39;s up to the surgeon to decide when to attempt the second surgery and remove stoma.
<br>
I was allowed to dilate, but again it&#39;s up to the surgeon to decide. From what I read, in most cases fistulas can be treated and then stomas removed
