I had minimum depth GCS on Thursday, September 30th at Temple Health, Dr Laura Douglas.  Came out of surgery that afternoon with no pain, just discomfort from dressing, drains, etc due to restricted movement.  On Saturday I walked around the hospital floor with drains and catheter bag attached to my gown. On Sunday drains and catheter removed - she is beautiful! - and did further walking.  On Monday I went home. Medication was basically stool softeners and some non pain medication. Started walking around the neighborhood, 1 mile at first and then increased to 1.5 miles at 3 weeks when I was cleared for driving and increased walking. Also started going back to where I exercise and besides walking on treadmill added in steps, planks, push ups, dips, rowing, etc. No pain continued, just swelling and limited movement, both which improved over time. The care in the hospital was excellent from the doctors and nursing staff. And, most importantly, I seem to be in a continued state of euphoria as I just feel better about myself.  Needless to say, the whole experience has been extremely, extremely positive!

My ONLY question is on a scale of 1 to 10, how much pain did you experience with the surgery?  Thank you in advance.

Initially I said 1-2/10 but I never needed pain killers. It really was limited mobility and discomfort from stitches, dressing, drains, catheter, etc. And that diminished over time. So I&#39;d say I had no pain. I&#39;m not insensitive to pain - passing a kidney stone - was horrible, it just wasn&#39;t there.

People vary widely on how much pain they experience so it’s not very useful knowing what someone else has. What is useful is knowing if the surgeon who’s prepared to give you proper painkillers or not, as some don’t.

Hey congrats! This is very helpful, as I get mine in January. I was wondering how much was &#34;minimal&#34; depth for you? I&#39;ve heard it varies depending on how much skin is available. Any dilation required at all?

It&#39;s a dimple of about half an inch. No dilation required.

Is minimal depth considered less painful than full depth vaginoplasty?

I have not seen that mentioned as a difference. I have read of people that have had pain with both. In the end my experience is a combination of my tolerance and the skill of the surgeon.
