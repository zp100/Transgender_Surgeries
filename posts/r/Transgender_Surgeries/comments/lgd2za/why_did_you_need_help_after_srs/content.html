Lol! How about just standing up? Making food, fetching medication, helping you get in and out of the shower or tub. Dealing with post-surgery clean ups. Cheering you up, Keeping you company, double-checking your bandages and wounds, helping you get dressed and undressed. Being there in case you have an medical emergency or fall. God forbid your dog chews through your catheter tube.
</p>
<p>
The wise thing to do is have someone to help and then taper them off as needed. You can&#39;t anticipate every post-op issue you might run into and there are a lot of them. Don&#39;t even think of doing this alone.

Well you wonâ€™t be very mobile, you will be in pain, you will be medicated, and you will be weak as a kitten with almost no energy. Sure it is POSSIBLE to get by alone but if there is a complication? Dishes, laundry, cooking will all be massive challenges as it is and if anything was wrong you would not be able to drive yourself

Havenâ€™t had it yet but I am on the waiting list now (had my second opinion today) and Iâ€™ve been advised that there are two main reasons: - strenuous tasks like cooking and cleaning when lifting so much as a mug could be too much - emotional support. This is a difficult period for many and having someone there to support you through goes a long way.

Looking forward to reading more specific replies as well!

I could have survived if I&#39;d been on my own, but someone to bring food, drink, or fetch a blanket makes life much easier. X

Standing and moving around are exhausting after SRS. Anything that requires mobility will be harder than usual and you will appreciate the help you can get. There are lots of small things someone can help with that will let you focus on healing and gaining your independence again. I also found having someone around helped with my mood and kept me on track and motivated.

Iâ€™m nine weeks post op and am back to working, and when I get home I am exhausted.  My work is not too intense, but itâ€™s still a lot of movement throughout the day.

I was able to get up and walk around enough to make myself dinner and that sort of thing (as long as they were fairly basic. I did meal prep before surgery, so I had a lot of frozen stuff that just needed to be reheated.) I never really experienced any post-surgical exhaustion, although a fair number of folks do. What I mostly needed help with were things that required lifting, like cleaning the litter box, taking out the trash, vacuuming, and getting groceries. I had a friend who would stop by every couple days to help out with this stuff for the first month or so, but otherwise I got along by myself just fine. YMMV though.
