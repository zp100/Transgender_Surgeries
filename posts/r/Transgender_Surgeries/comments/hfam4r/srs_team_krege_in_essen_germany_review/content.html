I write this because I think it is helpfull for other who want to under go the surgery to have as many information as possible.
</p>
<p>
This is based on my experience and might differ from others.
</p>
<p>
Team Krege consists of 3 surgeons: Prof dr Krege 20+ years of experience Dr Bohr 10+ years of experience Dr Lang 2 years of experience
</p>
<p>
Why chose Krege? Krege is known for fixing failed neovaginas. What I mean with this is that a lot of people who had srs and are now suffering from complications some from the surgery some from not dilating etc. Come to Krege to fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
Important imformation: Krege herself does not do standart srs anymore. The surgeries are performed by Lang and Bohr. While Lang does the bulk if the work Bohr only does the difficult parts like clitoris, skingraft, urinal trackt. This information is not given by the team. At least all I talked to did not know that.
</p>
<p>
When I had my surgery I was told it was going to be done by Krege and only days after surgery I was informed that Lang and Bohr did it. So keep that in mind.
</p>
<p>
In my case Bohr failed everthing she did and I had to undergo 3 more surgeries with Krege herself to fix the mess. Since I had 4 surgeries the result is not as good as hoped but still exceptable and funktionell. This showes the skill difference in the team and highlight Kreges skill compared to Bohr. Others had the surgery with Bohr and everything went well.
</p>
<p>
How are you treated? Krege is very experienced and you feel it. She speaks her mind and does not hold back. She has zero empathy but you feel safe in her hands.
</p>
<p>
Bohr is arrogant and incompetent.
</p>
<p>
Lang is still a bit inexpirienced but has a lot of emphathy and I have high hopes that she will become a great surgeon in the near futur.
</p>
<p>
I can recommend team Krege if Krege does the surgery.
</p>
<p>
All of this is based on my personal experience with each surgeon and might differ from others.

Oof that&#39;s quite a blow. I have my consultation with Dr Krege next month as I generally heard good things about HER results. Knowing that the main task get offloaded to severely less experienced colleagues is quite a bummer and is definitely going to make me reconsider. I am sorry you needed so many additional surgeries :(

Thanks for posting. I&#39;ll put this in the wiki here, but I&#39;ve a few questions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How much did it cost?
</li>
<li>
How long was the wait list?
</li>
<li>
How much depth did you get?
</li>
<li>
How was pain?
</li>
<li>
Did you see any post-op results before having surgery?
</li>
<li>
How are they allowed to change the surgeon without telling you, and how can someone make sure they do not do that?
</li>
<li>
Do you have any links to information on any of these surgeons or other reviews?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Are these the 3 surgeons
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Susanne Krege
</li>
<li>
Julia Bohr
</li>
<li>
Cordula Lang
</li>
</ul>

Costs: my insurance covered it, therefore I only had to pay 10€ per day spend in hospital. Including all 4 surgeries I had spend 37 days in hospital which costs 370€. This also includes all the medications I had to take during my time in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Waiting list: I had to wait for 2 years.
</p>
<p>
Depth: my original skingraft failed and I switched to a sigmoid colon vaginoplastic. Which resulted in a depth of 25cm.
</p>
<p>
Pain: I generally do not feel much pain so I took pain killer for around 4 days after the first surgery and no pain killers after the others.
</p>
<p>
Post op pictures before the surgery: I was shown puctures when I had my first colsultation.
</p>
<p>
How are they allowed to change the surgeon withou telling me: the are not. The argue that picking a surgeon is not feasable and the surgeries are done by the team. And you pick the team for the surgery. In contrast to that I demanded strongly that only Krege herself would perform the following surgeries due to the fact that I lost all trust in Bohr. If they would have rejected it, I would have left the hospital. But Krege was very helpfull and performed all the correction surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Other informations: All other informations about them are in german from documents and even a short tv documentation. 90% of my information came from other trans people who went to Krege.
</p>
<p>
Are those the surgeon: yes those are the surgeon
