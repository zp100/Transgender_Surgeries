This is a reposting from back in November of 2022. I&#39;m primarily doing this as I wanted to separate my other account from surgery related things. Thanks!

Hai! &lt;3
</p>
<p>
This first week has definitely been challenging and difficult, one of the hardest weeks of my life for sure. However, I feel like I&#39;ve made it through the worst of it to be honest. I&#39;m sure I have some more hurdles to get through, but I feel much better physically and am really optimistic about my recovery.
</p>
<p>
I had my catheter and packing removed yesterday with Dr. Hyer, and then my dilation teaching directly after that.
</p>
<p>
At my appointment, as I was undressing to get everything removed, Dr. Hyer immediately exclaimed that my swelling looked phenomenal for only a week. She was very happy :) I was a bit concerned about it, so I&#39;m glad she immediately reassured me before I could even ask about it. She started with removing my packing which... was the most bizarre and odd feeling ever. Describing it is almost impossible. It was similar to the feeling of pooping, in a way, but obviously different as it was not the same area. There was a total of 15ft of packing on my vaginal canal. It wasnt very saturated either meaning the inside was healing really well. Getting this out relieved SO much pressure.
</p>
<p>
Next was the catheter, and OWIE that hurt coming out. She didnt even tell me she was about to do it which honestly was a good thing. It was akin to getting a piercing in a way. Immediate sharp pain, but it didnt last for more than like 3 seconds, then it was just relief. She had me pee on my own for the first time, which went really well. No issues outside of it coming out only on my left side because of the swelling haha. Everything went really well and I left that appointment feeling really good and a lot of relief from having them removed.
</p>
<p>
Dilation teaching went well, but oof it was painful at first. She was able to get me to the 5th dot initially on her own, and then had me do it as well. It was really scary and she had to help me a bit, but I ended up being able to do it as well. Dilating on my own has been even scarier without the help, but ive done it twice now and I already feel much more confident than before. I&#39;m learning how to best relax my pelvic floor, as well as the angles in which allow easiest entry. The only weird thing I&#39;ve noticed for myself, is that it goes in at a slight angle as you can see in the photos, instead of just going straight in. I imagine this is just because of swelling, and will get better over time.
</p>
<p>
I feel great about everything currently, dilating 3x a day is going to suck for a while, but I&#39;ve already created a good schedule and a comfy environment to make it less tedious.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any!! :)
