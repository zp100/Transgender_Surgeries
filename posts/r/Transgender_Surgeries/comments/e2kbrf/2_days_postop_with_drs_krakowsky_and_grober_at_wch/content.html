Following up on my day 1 thread, and doing so a bit earlier in the day this time...
</p>
<p>
Emery and Dr. Krakowsky removed the dressing over my vulva this morning, which was exciting, kind of painful, and interesting in terms of sensation mapping.
</p>
<p>
The packing and catheter are still in place, my incisions are mostly covered in steri strips and bloody, and the whole area is swollen, but it is unmistakably mine. It feels like, after 36 years, I finally have the right equipment down there as opposed to this thing stuck to the front of me (that, admittedly, felt pretty good to use.)
</p>
<p>
Compared to the day 0 photo Dr. Krakowsky showed me in recovery, my clitoris has disappeared into its hood, which has also gotten less prominent. The majora are more swollen, and I can&#39;t really see my minora at all below the hood.
</p>
<p>
I also got to get out of bed this morning.  Emery and Celeste (the physiotherapist working with the team) got me standing up, and sitting back down again. Trying to sit up without really engaging the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles is a challenge, and I definitely felt some pressure from the packing. Standing up after a day and a half in bed was a huge relief, it felt fantastic not having pressure on my lower back and pelvis. My calf decided to make things a bit more challenging by not letting me flex my ankle fully, but it wasn&#39;t a show stopper. Standing also put some downwards pressure on the area, which wasn&#39;t terribly comfortable, but I understand that it&#39;s a temporary state of affairs. Trying to sit down in a chair didn&#39;t entirely work out, I felt too much of a pull around my vagina to be comfortable putting my entire weight on my butt.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was pretty non-descript, but I actually felt like I was hungry again, as opposed to just eating because I should.
</p>
<p>
I get to try walking around later this afternoon, which should be fun. I no longer have a solid pelvic floor, so I&#39;m guessing it will feel slightly different, especially with the packing in place. We shall see.

I was right, walking was a bit different, and with the packing in place I was definitely taking slow and deliberate steps.
</p>
<p>
I also felt some gentle tugging in my vulva, but I couldn&#39;t localize it accurately, it felt like it was coming from the inside of the shaft of my former penis, so my guess is that it was the catheter tugging gently at my urethra.
</p>
<p>
Remapping sensations is a novel experience, feeling an isolated sensation in a structure that no longer exists and trying to place it in your new anatomy.  I had the novel sensation on day 0 of feeling the outline of my clitoris in exquisitely painful detail as what felt like all of the nerve endings in it fired at once. It felt completely isolated in space without any surrounding sensation. When I had the dressing removed this morning, the same nerves fired again, but with context around them from the rest of my hood and minora, and it felt like it was solidly part of my body instead of a disembodied cluster of nerves.

You&#39;re welcome. I both want to share my experiences for others to benefit from, and to have a reference that I can turn to in the future.
</p>
<p>
And, thank you. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Having the right genitals is a very comforting feeling. My vulva may be swollen and beaten up, but it is unmistakably mine. Something I could never really have said about the penis that used to be attached to the front of my pelvis.

The recovery process is both fascinating and painful. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d remember most of the little details if I weren&#39;t journaling like this.  I was just woken up by the pain from gas in my bowel and rectum. Waiting for painkillers to kick in so I can get back to sleep.  And trying to avoid tensing up my muscles.
