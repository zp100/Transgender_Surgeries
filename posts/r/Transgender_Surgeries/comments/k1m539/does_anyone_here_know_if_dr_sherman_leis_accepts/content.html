this is my last question topic I apologize. I am just trying to see what my options here are. I am nervous about rumer and I think he is another option I have had long standing communication with this doctor and his staff and feel comfortable here he is just really expensive. I also sent an email to him but as we are going through Thanksgiving weekend I don&#39;t expect a reply possibly not until Monday. Does anyone know if he does. I live in Philadelphia I am also open to getting insurance he will take if anyone knows any but currently I have Keystone First. Thank you guys you have been wonderfully helpful to me.

They don’t participate in insurance.  He’s considered out of network.

Well I consulted with him two years ago that’s what I was told.  They were considered out of network and not much help we all due to contracted rates.

you are probably correct I think t he insurance stuff is pretty recent. I will try to find the reddit thread but the master list on the subreddit here has a link to the post if you find it before me.

Just make sure you do your research if you’re thinking about him. Every surgeon has their bad outcomes, but I know someone who had a botched surgery with him and have heard anecdotally from multiple, unrelated other people to stay away. Good luck!
