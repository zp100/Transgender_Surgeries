After two years of fighting, I finally got the checks in the mail this week that covered about 72% of my out-of-pocket medical bills. Big shout out to Transcend Legal,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ufMm0N1n3JjRpJtAuGgPA/playlists">their resources
</a>
, and personal help.
</p>
<p>
It all started back in the spring of 2019. I had just come out at work and had started HRT in January. A coworker told me that our company added a rider to our insurance plan back in 2015 to cover FFS. I knew this was something I really wanted so I started seeing surgeons. I really liked Dr. D&#39;s results and felt willing to pay the premium to go with someone with a good reputation and someone who could do a type 3 forehead. I was also living temporarily in San Francisco at the time so I wouldn&#39;t need to pay for local lodging.
</p>
<p>
Dr. D of course does not deal with insurance at all. The most they do is give you a bill with ICD codes and submit the initial insurance pre-auth.
</p>
<p>
My insurance was through Allied Benefit in Illinois via the global software consulting company I worked for. The important thing to know is that it&#39;s a managed plan, so basically the employer sets aside a pool of money to cover claims and the insurance company is just the claims processor and gatekeeper and tells the employer how much to pay out.
</p>
<p>
The policy explicitly stated:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
services in connection with gender reassignment surgery, including but not limited to, face lifting, lip enhancements, facial contouring etc., when accompanied by a Physicianâ€™s statement of medical necessity shall be considered an eligible expense
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So on the face of it, it would seem that FFS is covered. To be sure, I followed the extra requirements needed for other gender related surgeries, which was 1 year of HRT, my primary provider&#39;s note of medical necessity, and two therapists&#39; letters.
</p>
<p>
After my FFS consult I had to get x-rays of my jaw and skull. Surprisingly, insurance paid the claim for that with no questions asked and classified them as &#34;dental x-rays.&#34; OK!
</p>
<p>
I then attempted to get pre-approval several months before my surgery scheduled for Jan 2020 (yes I spent Jan-Mar recovering only to be sent back into lockdown :p ). In that time I appealed the pre-approval twice because insurance claimed it was &#34;not deemed medically necessary.&#34; Of course, they would not explain why. The representative on the phone (who revealed she had a trans child) tried to help as much as she could and offered, &#34;well some cis woman could claim to be trans to get plastic surgery so they have to know that you&#39;re actually trans.&#34; This proved to be incorrect, with me writing long essays that, yes, I&#39;m trans, and yes, this is medically necessary, and for god sakes read your own damn policy you wrote!
</p>
<p>
My appeals failed and I didn&#39;t get pre-approval. I had to get a line of credit from one of those shady lending startups that make you submit a video of you begging for money. But I figured one way or another I&#39;d get this, whether it&#39;d be covered in the end or I had to live with crushing debt for a while. I went ahead with the surgery.
</p>
<p>
Then, I got the full surgery report and final receipts and sent my initial claim. Denied, same reason. I appealed to medical review. At one point the website looked like it might pay out, but then they cut the payout to 0 again and was denied. &#34;Not medically necessary, cosmetic in nature.&#34;  This time, they basically said, &#34;hey, yeah so our policy says we&#39;ll cover FFS, but you know, there&#39;s this exclusion way in the back of the plan that says any sort of plastic surgery is considered cosmetic.&#34; Such bullshit.
</p>
<p>
So before I tried the second level of appeal, I sent an email to Transcend Legal and offered to hire them for advice. They were super helpful and said, first ask if your employer will reprocess the claim and ask Allied to remove the exclusion. So I did, and my former employer&#39;s HR was super helpful and understanding. This did require having to share the surgery I just had done with them :(
</p>
<p>
But happily, after a couple months it was finally approved!
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps others who are trying to fight insurance.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I&#39;m suuuuuper happy with the results I got with Dr. D. It&#39;s amazing how he had never seen pictures of my family but I basically look a lot like my sister and mom. It&#39;s given me so much self confidence and every day I see myself in the mirror and am extremely happy. Everyone also says I look 15 years younger than I am.

Girl, you gotta help me! BCBSIL is making up rules as they go along and denied me. But they are cool with a rhinoplasty from a different provider for FFS. - Megan A.

That was nicely done.   What happened to you is close or actually does fit into the category of &#34;bad faith&#34; by the insurance company.   Congratulate yourself for being persistent.   That often works.

WTF? I&#39;ve never heard of anything like that. That sounds horrible.

That&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration but you do have to submit a video holding your id, stating your name and why you need the money

Congrats!!! What was the startup that you applied for a line of credit though? Did they cover the FFS amount?
