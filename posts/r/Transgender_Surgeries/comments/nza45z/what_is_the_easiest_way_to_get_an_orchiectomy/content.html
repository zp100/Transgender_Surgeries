My HRT has been off-and-on for a year and a half now because my state has ONE (1) informed consent clinic with a 3 month waitlist to get in and 3 weeks on followup appointments, so I&#39;ve always ended up running out before any blood tests. I recently decided to just say &#34;screw it&#34; and drive an hour and a half to Ohio where the Planned Parenthood locations ACTUALLY GIVE HRT but that&#39;s only been 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
In other words, while I HAVE been on HRT for a while, it&#39;s really not gone anywhere and it&#39;s not been &#34;continuous&#34; - the problematic word in the WPATH guidelines for me. I&#39;d really like to get rid of my testicles, since I&#39;m getting SOME progress on estradiol but my 50mg spiro/2mg E starter dose I&#39;ve been stuck on the whole time is barely even taking the edge off my testosterone levels.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m tired of waiting around, and I SURE AS HELL don&#39;t wanna have to wait a whole nother YEAR before I can make an appointment that ends up being another 6 months of waiting ON TOP OF THAT. I know damn well my insurance isn&#39;t gonna cover jack shit, they don&#39;t even cover my HRT (thank god for GoodRX...) so following WPATH at all is not a concern, I hate them with a passion (as does, probably, everyone on the sub). My therapist has told me he&#39;s willing to lie to write me a letter, if needed, but anyone who checks my records is gonna see the gaps.
</p>
<p>
So, what&#39;s the fastest, preferably cheap, way to get an orchi without playing phone tag with 2 therapists (of which I only have one), Planned Parenthood, multiple hospitals looking for price quotes since there&#39;s no transparency most places, etc? I know there are SOME informed consent surgeons in the US, but I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re pretty expensive. One option I&#39;ve heard is going to Mexico, since they don&#39;t do WPATH at all and supposedly they come as cheap as $600 before you factor in airfare and hotel?? Any other good suggestions, and maybe a step-by-step of how to get an appointment set up with someone if I don&#39;t have a referral?

Dr. Melissa Belmonte, in Guanajuato, Mexico.
</p>
<p>
She did mine in 2015, paid like $800 USD back then (I think she increased her prices a little bit, but not much), and did a stellar job. 1 hour in, the incision was small and all the other tissue is still reusable for SRS.
</p>
<p>
She works under informed consent, so, no need for letters.

It&#39;s not WPATH that causing you problems it&#39;s the insurance companies that stipulate the requirements for WPATH standards. WPATH has no enforcement ability. They just have the working group that writes, updates and maintains the standards of care. They are guidelines. With that said, I understand where you&#39;re coming from in terms of access to care. That&#39;s the issue here. Since you have been on HRT for a year and a half, did you have letters at some point or was it always informed consent?
</p>
<p>
Do you have a primary doc locally that will prescribe your HRT meds. Just make your case that you&#39;ve been on them for 18 months.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, Mexico is your best bet for an Orchie.
