Your face is just really really swollen and it might just take some time and especially if you say this is one of two surgeries this is definitely not the end result? Talk to your surgeon and if you still feel like this isn’t for you don’t do the second one

I understand the swollen part which makes the jaw/chin difficult to judge. But I&#39;m looking at my hair he said he would lower it 25mm (2.5cm) doesn&#39;t look like that much and it&#39;s straight line don&#39;t like how it looks. When lift my hairs there I see empty spots as well. Really no clue what he did there and if that will ever fill.

I don’t want to delegitimize your feelings or anything but I’ve had ffs not forehead or hairline but I also felt like regret and it wasn’t worth it but over the months and swelling going down I got to feel better Those empty spots could be hair falling off from shock, but also what’s more likely hair just being cut from the incision. As I said the best thing you could do is talk this out with your surgeon and I’m pretty sure he can ease your mind and you always have the choice of not going through with it waiting half a year or more and maybe get a different surgeon in the future

Actually thinking of cancelling the 2nd surgery and either go somewhere else or jump in front of a train.
</p>
<p>
The following has been done:
</p>
<p>
- hair lowering (he said 25mm but it doesn&#39;t look like that much)
</p>
<p>
- brow lift and forehead shave
</p>
<p>
- jaw &amp; chin shave
</p>
<p>
- ears more towards side-face (but now looking at before picture my ears weren&#39;t that bad)
</p>
<p>
- lip lift
</p>
<p>
- top of nose lifted (something added under skin)
</p>

You have post op depression. I had suicidal thoughts after my FFS as well. It&#39;s hard, even more so without emotional support.
</p>
<p>
Regarding your results. You don&#39;t even got your stitches removed. It takes time for swelling to go down. For some the swelling goes down in a few weeks, Others have to deal with it for months. It took 6 months to appreciate my results and 12 months the see the final outcome of my FFS.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think your surgeon did a had job with your hairline. It looks like it was receded and therefore it&#39;s not possible to round it out with hairline lowering. By bringing it not too far down you still can get a hair transplant after everything is healed.

Was going to comment something along these lines. FFS is really a 12 month kind of procedure. You really don&#39;t see the final results until then.

I actually notice a huge difference in all of the points you just listed, especially with your brow bone. Your chin and jaw are still extremely swollen, from what I&#39;ve heard chin &amp; jaw tend to take the longest for swelling to be completely gone (like up to a year for all swelling I believe). I think once you&#39;re a bit further out of surgery you&#39;ll see a lot more changes.
</p>
<p>
Imo you look female in the second one, and the nice thing is after the swelling is down, if there&#39;s still some areas you think the doctor could have been more aggressive on, you can selectively get those procedures done.
</p>
<p>
Example, if the swelling goes down completely on your jaw or chin and you still feel it&#39;s too masculine, you could get some more jaw or chin shaving, which wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as intensive or expensive as the FFS you just went through.

I wish I could send hugs through the internet. I think when you’re healed you’re going to resemble Hilary Swank. I hope you have a support system at home?

Well my girlfriend wants a man. She helps me with whatever I need but she doesn&#39;t support my transition. I told her I wasn&#39;t happy with the results and she immediately uses that to say that I cannot be woman and not everyone has a successful transition, most pictures you see on the internet are fake, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
I have to sit this one thru, cannot move out atm.

Sounds like your girlfriend is no friend at all, and is pretty toxic.  I hate to say this, but for your mental health, you need to distance yourself from her.

You do look more feminine in the second picture. The best part about living is you can continue to change as long as you draw breath. Please stay alive honey, it&#39;s hard for me too, but things can&#39;t get better once you die.

I&#39;m 3 weeks out from FFS.  It takes 3 to 6 weeks to start seeing the results, and 3 to 6 months before you really see what the final form is.
</p>
<p>
Be patient.  That&#39;s all I can really say.

ok, update.
</p>
<p>
Today 2021/11/25 I went to Facial Team.
<br>
Called them and wanted to book a session in Marbella but they have a clinic now in Barcelona. If I had known :(
</p>
<p>
Everything the surgeon has done was wrong; forehead shave not ok (its not type-3; I asked him and he told me it was just a description its all the same; clearly not), hair lowering is a bad approach should have done hair implants (so no visible scar on forehead)
<br>
Jaw &amp; chin shave he didn&#39;t remove anything from the jaw and only a little from chin which is now asymmetric.
</p>
<p>
Facial Team won&#39;t do surgery before March next year, forehead needs to heal first otherwise hair implants may fail.
</p>
<p>
Waste of time, money and pain.
</p>
<p>
Dr Joan Forrester Birbe is unqualified to perform this kind of surgery. I wish I could warn people not to make the same mistake I did :(

I know it sounds cliché but please hang in there. I had FFS 39 days ago. I&#39;m still very swollen in the lower third of my face. I&#39;m pretty certain there&#39;s even more swelling than it appears in the upper two thirds.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m nervous about my results, but less so than a week ago. For very many of us, it really does take about a month to just maybe (maybe!) start seeing the results, and as others have noted here and through this sub, FFS is a 6-12 month surgery; please be patient, and don&#39;t hurt yourself.
</p>
<p>
I get it; it&#39;s a really difficult time. From day 9 to 30-35, I had so much post-op depression. I had some terrible thoughts. I doubted every decision I made regarding FFS. Even still, I&#39;m not convinced my results are what I&#39;d hoped, but it really has gotten better after the first month and I&#39;m going to be patient and see how it looks in 6-12 months before worrying. Please hang in there. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re experiencing this.

If you are looking to get a more extreme result perhaps look into surgeons that do double-jaw surgery or LeFort procedures like they do in Korea.
</p>
<p>
Length of the upper jaw is highly influenced by testosterone and makes the midface seem larger overall.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it is tough to change a face to a patients liking without some heavy bone altering work on the skull.

I had hairline lowering surgery too and thought the same thing. But you just had surgery so it will take 6 months to a year before all your baby hairs and stuff grow in and it makes your forehead look much smaller. At least that is what happened to me. I went to Dr. Crane.

He did something to my chin; (didn&#39;t really understand it; like bundled muscles together in chin area) It&#39;s still numb and I cannot open my mouth wide. When I try to sing some passages are difficult, also gives me a headache (on the sides like its straining)
</p>
<p>
I had a session with Facial Team and their proposal is;
<br>
- Secondary forehead reconstruction (coronal)
<br>
- Rhinoplasty
<br>
- Chinplasty &amp; jaw surgery (secondary)
</p>
<p>
I want to see their &#39;preview&#39; first, not sure if I want more or that their suggestions will  be satisfactory.

I&#39;m sorry to hear you are having some difficulties, I&#39;ve heard it takes a year to recover completely tho, I hope you soon regain your full movement. Best of luck with your revision!

You&#39;re gonna look great when they are done. You already look more feminine after the first surgery.
