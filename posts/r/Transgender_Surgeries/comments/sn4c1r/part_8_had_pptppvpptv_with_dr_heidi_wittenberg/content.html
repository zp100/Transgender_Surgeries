<p>
1-19-22: A week after seeing my PCP, she unexpectedly decided to refer me to the team of 7 OB/GYNs in Los Angeles that have the most experience treating Kaiser&#39;s post-op vaginoplasty patients.  I had an LA Kaiser number from when I did FFS and miraculously managed to get ahold of the person who approves GYN referrals (I say miraculously because it&#39;s notoriously difficult to get ahold of any particular person when you call a Kaiser number).  She approved me, then sent me to another person for scheduling.  She said there was a cancellation appointment that day so I rushed to LA and made it there about 15 mins late.
</p>
<p>
The GYN I saw (Shaunte Grey) was really nice and spent so much time with me answering questions.  She kept saying &#34;is there anything else?&#34; even after I asked at least 10 things already, and kept saying &#34;I was about to ask that!&#34; to things I brought up.  She said she&#39;d never seen another patient with compacted hair in the vaginal canal from dilation.  Instead of using the small metal (pediatric) speculum my previous gyn used, she used half of a clear plastic full size one which gave her a better view and probably stretched things less than the metal one would have:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/75fiukg2shg81.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3509d0857309edf9b10591bbcfefd1baeaa5ad2">https://preview.redd.it/75fiukg2shg81.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3509d0857309edf9b10591bbcfefd1baeaa5ad2
</a>
</p>
<p>
We tried a few times to get a clearer photo of the inside but the camera always wanted to focus on the outside.  But there was no granulation and she said the skin inside looked &#34;amazing&#34; and healthy enough to start increasing dilator size.  She inserted and removed that speculum at least 6 times and never caused any bleeding or much pain.
</p>
<p>
She called over another gyn from another building for a second opinion on my clit and talked to me for 10+ mins while they came over.   They didn&#39;t see any pus or necrotic (dead) tissue which kinda freaked me out that that was even a possibility they were looking for.  They both said I&#39;d had a great surgeon and their consensus was that I might be delaying clit healing by rubbing at the skin around it.  I was trying to soften scar tissue around the clit which I felt was squishing it sideways like a penny pressed between two palms but the gyns thought I should not touch it.  Second gyn also said to try a hot compress or &#34;sitz bath&#34; (basically sitting in a bowl of warm water that you place on a toilet seat so overflow can drain into the toilet).  I tried a heat pad once a day for a few days and it made no difference other than making things feel swollen.
</p>
<p>
Shaunte agreed with using estrogen cream to thicken skin and suggested I return to nightly use of the cream on labia to try to jumpstart further skin thickening.  She pointed out how labia skin was &#34;rolling over&#34; meaning a second layer was growing in over a thinner area and she said pointed out how labia skin was changing color to match the skin around it.  I asked if they could test the pH to see if the peritoneal skin was letting through transudate to make things more acidic than penile inversion to control bacteria.  She said they used to stock pH testing strips but haven&#39;t had the manpower lately to keep up with their maintenance (apparently they don&#39;t last long and need to be swapped out).  She said I could test with any paper strip as long as its acidic reading range is good (she thinks a lot are geared more towards measuring base levels instead of acid levels).
</p>
<p>
I asked if she thought it was necessary to use Vaseline to protect skin against silver nitrate and she said they usually don&#39;t bother because it only activates on dry skin and everything in the vag is wet.  She said they need to dry out the granulation with qtips before treating it and if it&#39;s bleeding it can be tough to get it dry enough.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Apparently that gyn had it completely backward and silver nitrate is actually
<a href="https://www.woundsource.com/blog/what-are-silver-nitrate-sticks">activated by moisture
</a>
.  So I still don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t use Vaseline or other protectants.  I guess they figure it just won&#39;t damage healthy skin enough to matter and it will heal within a few days, which seems to be true.  It still bugs me.  It probably has less effect on tissue in a penile inversion vaginoplasty but peritoneal tissue or cis tissue will always be damp.
</p>
<p>
1-20: I started using the orange dilator to start and got the larger purple to 2.5 dots showing.  Both hurt but I was gentle with my pushing.
<strong>
I also found that I could insert two fingers near vaginal entrance, spread them, and take a picture between them to see if I was causing redness or swelling at the entrance by sizing up
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
1-22: I don&#39;t know why it took me this long to realize that when I have a long hair stuck on my hand in the shower, I can carefully pull it away between two fingers on another hand, then blow it to get it to fall.  I used to always try to shake it off which usually fails.
</p>
<p>
1-25: I last did laser hair removal on genitals on 12-3, about 7 weeks ago, but there was very little regrowth of hair.  So I decided to skip burning the skin again and get rid of what did regrow using electrolysis.  It was remarkably painless.  It hurt a lot before surgery but I guess the combination of gabapentin and dulled nerves after surgery made a big difference.  Unfortunately, having labia squished around did hurt a little and caused some swelling and soreness through the next day.
</p>
<p>
2-1: I emailed Shaunte at some point asking how likely she though it was that my clit would heal.  She said &#34;we are optimistic that you will recover and feel better soon&#34; but she also gave me a referral to the LA plastic surgery team that works on trans patients.  So I saw two members of that team today.  One of the docs was the same lady I saw during my consult around two years ago when I was considering penile inversion with Kaiser.  Back then, I showed her my
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwHRvVvpLBJMnUyRQHcw2-Cr_4ImWYWK3OfKJ15Ab9c/edit#heading=h.a42yy0qqw7wd">research paper
</a>
and she said she&#39;d show it at their next meeting.  She said Kaiser was looking into offering PPTV but probably wouldn&#39;t for another 2-3 years at least.
</p>
<p>
They used a plastic pediatric speculum on me and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s actually larger than the half of a full size speculum or if plastic surgeons just aren&#39;t as careful about inserting it but it hurt a lot more.  When they were done, she accidentally let it snap closed instead of releasing it gently and that hurt even more.  Argh.  Luckily, speculums are built so they can&#39;t easily pinch skin or I would&#39;ve been bruised or bleeding.  Everything hurt so much I didn&#39;t ask them to take pictures, just wanting it to be over with.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps because they&#39;d been able to spread me open more with that speculum, they found granulation was still there at the deepest part of my canal.  She dabbed it with a big cotton swab on a stick and showed me there was a lot of blood from it.  I&#39;d been seeing more dark brown on my panty liners and I guess that granulation was why.  I asked why Shaunte hadn&#39;t found that granulation two weeks earlier and wondered if I was hurting myself with the dilator but they felt granulation can appear spontaneously sometimes.  That&#39;s a comforting thought!  I more suspect we didn&#39;t fully get rid of it with the previous silver nitrate treatment so it was gradually getting worse again.
</p>
<p>
So I got another silver nitrate treatment.  Maybe they used less silver than previous gyn because it didn&#39;t stain my whole inner labia silver but there was still a frightening amount of sloughed off skin falling out the next 2-3 days which makes me seriously doubt the theory that it doesn&#39;t affect damp skin.  They also felt I shouldn&#39;t skip any dilations in order to prevent the channel from closing and said that was always their recommendation to trans patients.  I still skipped dilation that night and moved back to the smallest purple for dilating the next day and it was pretty sore but I managed it.
</p>
<p>
I showed them the clit pictures I posted above (that start with &#34;12-25 immediately after&#34;) and they thought I had a tear on the right side of the clit (left side of the second picture).  She said as the tear heals it contracts and pulls the clit down.  She said it couldn&#39;t be fixed by surgery because that would require adding skin and that&#39;s not really feasible (I&#39;m not sure why since skin grafts are a thing but maybe trying to add skin and heal would just contract again?).  They also said it seemed to still be healing despite the injury being 5 weeks ago and give it another two weeks.  I mentioned a previous physical therapist had said healing skin needs to be manipulated a little so it doesn&#39;t scar and she agreed but couldn&#39;t give any details on how often or how much.
</p>
<p>
So I went home feeling very depressed.  Going in I was afraid they&#39;d say the only fix was surgical and I really really didn&#39;t want more surgery... but I realized it was even worse to be told that even surgery couldn&#39;t fix it.
</p>
<p>
And then I started thinking about it more.  First, I really don&#39;t think the redness in the day-after photo is a tear.  It wasn&#39;t bleeding and it&#39;s over such a large area, so it&#39;s bruising.  The clit also went from facing forward to tilted sideways in a single day.  I don&#39;t heal fast enough for skin to contract and pull it so far in a single day.  So I believe that swelling and possibly a little skin contraction is what pushed the clit off balance enough to get one side stuck under the vaginal walls to either side of the clit.  I see the clit as something like the cap of a muffin.  The walls normally squeeze against the base of the muffin and push the cap forward.  Once I got one side of the cap stuck beneath a wall, the whole cap gets squeezed sideways and closing my legs together puts more sideways pressure on it.  But the clit doesn&#39;t want to be sideways so it&#39;s creating swelling on both sides of it as the skin is stretched out of place.  That&#39;s why it still isn&#39;t &#34;healed&#34;.  Not that I want it to heal sideways.
</p>
<p>
2-2: I saw a new physical therapist.  I explained my theories about the clit being sideways to her and she agreed.  She agreed we need to rub at the swelling/scar tissue around it and try to work it back into place.  She said I could rub it every other day and she would see me weekly.  So I finally had hope but also a lot of anger at all the other doctors who&#39;d told me not to touch it and said it would just heal on its own.  I felt like I&#39;d let it heal into the wrong position for so long it might be too late to make it right and I was really depressed about that.
</p>
<p>
I also showed her this &#34;splint&#34; I&#39;d sculpted out of InstaMorph plastic (basically, plastic that melts around 150F and can be shaped until it cools):
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/wbe7zovkshg81.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecbac30ddde27e314e296ec22b30b1d00a48267">https://preview.redd.it/wbe7zovkshg81.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecbac30ddde27e314e296ec22b30b1d00a48267
</a>
</p>
<p>
The top left image is a concept sketch I made and showed the plastic surgeons.  They said it might help so that evening I made the first version in roughly that shape.  I had to feel the width of my clit with my fingertip and use that to roughly size the &#34;head&#34; of the splint which turned out to be 15.44mm wide in the second pic.  The &#34;fin&#34; above the head is held between the labia and was originally just supposed to keep the head in the right orientation against the clit but I realized it would be really useful to be able to touch the fin from outside the vaginal and use it to push the head into place.  So I greatly extended the fin in the third picture and was surprised it needed to be that long to be able to touch it when I&#39;m on my back with spread legs.  It turns out I can gauge labia swelling with the splint.  When not swollen, the front corner of the fin sticks up about a centimeter.  When swollen, the corner is just barely covered by the labia.
</p>
<p>
I showed that prototype version to the physical therapist and she said she&#39;d never had someone construct such a thing but she agreed it might help.  Its main purpose is to push the walls wider around the clit and let the clit move back into place.  So I asked the PT to get me a measurement of my clit&#39;s width which she did using a long stick from a cotton swab with her thumb marking the end of the measurement.  She later marked it with a marker and I took it home and used it to add tabs to the head of the splint that should be just wide enough to cup the clit on left and right.
</p>
<p>
At first I tried using the splint without lubricant, thinking it would stay better where I put it.  Then I forgot it was there as I got up to pee and when I removed it, it had left a bunch of red bits that looked like little bruises.  Surprisingly, they disappeared within an hour or so but I&#39;ve been using lube ever since and not seen redness.
</p>
<p>
The four lowest images are the current splint version.  Since the initial version, I added the tabs on the head and made the head taller to try to ensure it would push the vaginal walls apart near the clit even if it wasn&#39;t pushed fully down on the clit.  I thickened the front and back of the fin after the back of it left a mark where it pushes the point my labia meet.  I added thickness to the part running back from the head towards the vaginal canal so the back would be held in place better.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve tried repeatedly to feel if the splint is actually pushing the clit fully back into place when I push the head down against the clit and I&#39;m still not sure.  I even tried rigging a camera pointing down and later pointing up as I squatted over it, trying to spread my labia far enough apart that I can get a picture of how the splint affects things.  I could never get the labia out of the way enough to clearly tell.  But I do know that when my clit is turned too far it hurts, and when it&#39;s hurting, if I push the splint down on it, it feels better.  So I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s helping even if it probably isn&#39;t getting it fully back into place.  It also tends to slip upward a bit if I don&#39;t apply pressure down against the clit so the clit is definitely not staying fully in place with the splint, but the splint should at least prevent the clit from getting crushed so much it turns 90 degrees.
</p>
<p>
I was hoping I could use the splint to sleep on my side without crushing the clit but closing my legs on it, the splint puts enormous pressure on everything and if it slips out of place just a little while I&#39;m asleep it could bruise something or make things worse.  So starting 1-4, I began to sleep on my back and that really, really sucks.  I worked so hard to be able to sleep on my side after months of healing after the surgery and going back to back sleeping makes me feel like I&#39;ve lost all progress and makes me sad and anxious.
</p>
<p>
The first night I tried cheating, putting a pillow halfway under my butt and halfway under my back so I was sort of 3/4 on my back and could turn my head to have my cheek against the pillow.  But by the next day I had bad neck and back pain so I gave up doing that again.  The next night I went full on my back and had so much trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.  I was so depressed the next day and cried a lot.  But the next two nights haven&#39;t been too bad.  My therapist suggested I try finding relaxation videos on youtube and I
<a href="https://youtu.be/1ZYbU82GVz4">found one
</a>
that seems to help put me to sleep.
</p>
<p>
2-6: I&#39;ve been anxious and impatient and doing at least a little pushing of the clit and walls at least once a day but trying to limit significant massage to once every two days.  Tonight, for the first time since I re-started massage, I felt the right edge of the clit push up above the harder part of the vaginal wall.  It wouldn&#39;t stay there, but it made me feel I&#39;d made a little progress towards improving it and that made me feel significantly more hope.  It also gave me enough energy to write this journal update.  I&#39;m still very afraid it will never go back to normal but the physical therapist thinks there&#39;s a decent chance it will as we work on it.
</p>
<p>
I should also mention that InstaMorph plastic has not been tested as safe for internal use and it&#39;s known to degrade in wet or acidic conditions.  When I wash it with soap after removing it, I always feel like it may be leaving some plastic residue on my fingers.  I looked online and found some people have used
<a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/teeth-instamorph-beads/">InstaMorph for dentures
</a>
claiming they&#39;ve had no ill effects after a year while other people are like &#34;don&#39;t do that it&#39;s not safe!&#34; but nobody has really spent the money to do testing to be sure one way or the other.  Even if they&#39;re not lying about using InstaMorph dentures for a year, there could still be long-term liver effects or cancer risks, so I don&#39;t feel entirely safe wearing my current splint and hope to get it 3D printed in a safer material at some point.  Of course that means I need to make a 3D model of it which is a huge pain and then pay for it to be printed.  I spent a lot of time looking for other heat-sculpted materials that would be safer but everything I found melts at very high temperatures and is meant for injection molding, not hand-sculpting.  I could also cast my splint and pour something into the cast, maybe a
<a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/page/skin-safe-materials/">skin-safe alginate
</a>
, but I worry about bubbles creating surface bits that could be sharp.  Proper casting requires a machine that puts the cast under air pressure to push out bubbles and I don&#39;t have that, nor do I have any practical experience with casting so I worry I&#39;ll waste time and money and end up with nothing usable.
</p>
<p>

<p>
In other topics, the PT thought my belly scars looked really good and she had trouble finding one of them.  She only felt scarring under the leftmost one but there was no time to work on it in the initial exam.  She also found tightness in my left hip flexor and my inner thighs.  She found scar tissue in labia and said I can massage them but to be gentle.  I should press until I feel the scar tissue, then rub in circles over it without pressing against it much.  She also described it as squeezing a tomato till it dimples but don&#39;t squeeze hard enough to break its skin.  If I end up sore and swollen the next day, I rubbed too hard.
</p>
<p>
She said I can bring in my dilators and we can work on techniques for using them without as much pain/pressure.  She did a brief internal exam with one finger.  I was very tight on insertion which was always the case with the previous PT.  She had me squeeze on the finger, then release, then relax further.  She said I could imagine the squeezing as bringing an elevator from the lobby up to the first floor, release it back to the lobby, then let it descend to the basement.  The descending will feel like a subtle muscle movement compared to the contracting.
</p>
<p>
She also gave me a mirror on a long pole so I could watch some of what she was doing and I thought that was neat.  Overall I felt she was a little smarter and better prepared with tools and techniques than my previous PT.  Her table was also motorized and could be raised way up to help her do certain things or see better what she was doing.
</p>
<p>
During her initial questioning about general pelvic health she was asking about regularity of bowel movements and I said I wasn&#39;t sure because I&#39;d been taking Senna tablets since surgery and it made me irregular.  I kept taking them because I&#39;d had an anal fissure from a large poop about two years ago and it still hurt when I passed anything of significant size.  Then I learned it was bad to stay on Senna long term, so I started using anal dilators 5 mins a night.  I gradually increased size over the last 3 months or so and it&#39;s made a remarkable difference.  It no longer hurts to do number 2 even once I stopped Senna a couple weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
My last facial electrolysis was 12-6-21 and I finally got auth to do it again through Kaiser and went in 2-6.  She did a full clear in about an hour and that&#39;s major progress from 2-3 months ago when full clears were 2+ hours even when I went in every 2-3 weeks.  I&#39;ve also realized most of my dark body hair is gone and that&#39;s just the effects of estrogen.  So all good news on the hair front.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to labia pain, I think the clit splint has been irritating them a bit and I&#39;m using ice more often to reduce some swelling and minor pain.  But I think between PT and my massages they&#39;ll keep improving.  I sat on a hard chair in a restaurant yesterday without really any pain but I kept my legs spread trying to prevent clit crushing.  I also had my SO drive while I lay in back with my legs spread.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to dilating, there is still soreness and it&#39;s hard to keep orange at full depth.  For the last few nights, purple gets to about 1.5 dots visible and hurts too much to push deeper.  I felt some soreness in the canal after using purple a couple nights ago so definitely don&#39;t want to push it too hard.  I&#39;m hoping the PT can help.

3-1-22 update (51 weeks, 11.7 months post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/g66nelmhu0l81.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18d5aea155bce5547d2b740b5a4591aabf67c843">https://preview.redd.it/g66nelmhu0l81.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18d5aea155bce5547d2b740b5a4591aabf67c843
</a>
</p>
<p>
Nothing&#39;s changed internally since my last update so I&#39;m skipping that pic.  It does seem my labia continue to get less red and they feel thicker everywhere.  Labia pain is marginally better overall since three weeks ago.  It&#39;s hard to gauge because sometimes they hurt to touch and other times they don&#39;t, but I think the frequency of hurting has diminished.  I generally rub estrogen cream in them and massage scar tissue every other day and they always feel more swollen and painful the next day even if I&#39;m very gentle.
</p>
<p>
I just got home from 4 hours in rush hour traffic after seeing the plastic surgeons again in Los Angeles.  She said the tissue to the right of the clit looks less red than last time and she agreed it&#39;s probably staying red because it&#39;s always getting stretched by the clit being turned sideways.  She also felt it would be fine to leave the clit like it is but said they could probably remove tissue to either side of the clit to give it room to face forward again.
</p>
<p>
I really don&#39;t want another surgery but at least there&#39;s a surgical option if I can&#39;t fix it with physical therapy, so that made me feel a little better.  I&#39;m not sure why they didn&#39;t suggest that option last time but I think they were convinced the right of the clit was pulling down due to tissue healing and that&#39;s just not the case since it pulled down the day after the injury and popped up the next day, then went down again the following day and never came up again.
</p>
<p>
She did an internal exam with the pediatric speculum again but since I seemed to tolerate it well she tried the smaller adult speculum and I managed to accept it without too much pain, at least partially aided by the muscle relaxation I&#39;ve been learning at physical therapy.  She said granulation at the apex of the canal was improved but needed another nitrate treatment.  She also let me keep both plastic speculums since they get thrown away anyway so now I can take internal pics at home if I want to.  The speculums had LED lights in them that I think are always on until the batteries run out but they were fairly easy to disassemble to remove the batteries.
</p>
<p>
A couple weeks ago I dug out a third full-size pillow and now I sometimes sleep on my side with three full pillows stacked together running the distance between my knees and ankles.  The pillows squish so much, this still only keeps my knees around 8-10 inches apart so it puts a lot more pressure on my clit than having my legs spread, but not as much as having my legs fully together.  I tried adding a fourth pillow but having my knees that far apart while on my side puts too much strain on my back and crushes the lower knee too much.  I still try to sleep on my back with legs spread when I can stand to.
</p>
<p>
My PT said I should stop using the clit splint in case it&#39;s causing bruising or swelling but said I could hold the clit facing forward for 4 mins a day.  I pushed that to 4 mins twice a day, and then I started thinking the only thing preventing the clit from staying out is probably that the right side of it has contracted enough that the pressure of the flesh to both sides can&#39;t force the clit out above the flesh - the muffin analogy I mentioned in my last update.  So my goal is to stretch the right side upward, and doing so should be a lot like stretching the vaginal canal wider, which is done with 10-30 minute stretches at least once per day.  So it should be safe to hold the clit in place longer.  I plan to pose this theory to my PT but won&#39;t see her until next week.

Using the digital zoom on
<a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/capture.html">Logitech Capture
</a>
(free software, but only usable with newer Logitech webcams), I can watch close up as I manipulate my clit and coax out its right side.  Being able to see with the camera helps me keep it out without too much pressure and I&#39;ve gone 30+ mins without injuring myself.  I only did that for a couple days so far and haven&#39;t made any obvious progress, but we&#39;ll see.  The right side of the clit looks a little more purple and glossy and that may be because it&#39;s being kept moist and rarely exposed to air so that&#39;s one additional reason I think it&#39;s a terrible idea to leave it like it is.

The physical therapist says my vaginal canal is tightest at the entrance so she suggested I try using the orange dilator to full depth, then go up two sizes just at the entrance.  After a couple weeks of near zero progress on improving diameter, I pushed it too far and ended up with dilations that were increasingly painful and started seeing more discharge on panty liners, so I went back to starting with the smallest dilator for 10 mins and ending on orange.  Losing progress there was very depressing and it feels impossible to make any actual progress on gaining width without causing damage.  But at least last night I had an almost pain-free dilation which is rare so I&#39;ve resolved to be very careful about pushing when there&#39;s pain.
</p>
<p>
The PT also recommended the
<a href="https://cushionyourassets.com/shop/ols/products/twin-cheeks-cushion/v/TWC101-MDM">Twin Cheeks
</a>
cushion instead of a traditional donut cushion and it&#39;s been really great for driving.  I also demonstrated sitting on
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LSR1FD4">this donut cushion
</a>
to my PT who said it seemed good but for some reason I always get pretty bad labia pain whenever I get up from sitting on it even after a short drive.  With Twin Cheeks there&#39;s almost no pain getting up.  It&#39;s not a total miracle though - it puts more pressure on your pelvic bone and it was getting pretty uncomfortable after my 6+ hours of driving today, but it&#39;s certainly better than sitting without a cushion.

</p>
<p>
I just realized the cushion is backwards in the pic above - the rounded end is meant to rest against the back of the chair since most chairs have a curve to their back.  Twin Cheeks is pretty expensive so PT also suggested using two rolled towels or you could just buy your own foam and glue it or velcro it to a sheet of plastic.  Twin Cheeks is basically two pieces of fabric-covered foam with velcro on one side that sticks to another fabric-covered semi-flexible plastic sheet.  Thanks to the velcro, the foam blocks can be moved based on your body size.  I assume the ideal position is so the points of your pelvic bone rest in the center of both foam blocks.

I got three new PT exercises to do:

</a>
</p>
<p>
But I found my bed is too low to do the last one without my foot touching the floor so she said I could replace it with a hip extension like I posted in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/qldmt7/part_6_had_pptppvpptv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg/">part 6
</a>
- one knee and one foot on the ground while you push your weight forward towards the foot and try to feel a stretch along the front of your inner thigh.  She also said to stop doing the &#34;supine bent knee fallouts / wig wags&#34; I posted in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/qldmt7/part_6_had_pptppvpptv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg/">part 6
</a>
because they mostly help the lower back rather than pelvic floor.  &#34;Supine Pelvic Floor Stretch&#34; (aka &#34;Happy Baby&#34; in yoga) replaces a similar stretch I used to do where I kept the flats of my feet together and pulled my ankles up over my head.

3-9-22 mini update:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The last few days I&#39;ve settled on a regimen of holding the clit in place for 30 mins immediately before going to sleep.  I keep my legs spread and sleep on my back as long as I can stand.  A few hours later when I get up to pee or shift to my side I feel pressure like the clit has stayed somewhat in place.  I couldn&#39;t be sure I wasn&#39;t just feeling swelling or something until last night when my clit did not slip to the side when I removed my fingers, and even as I let the labia close over it I could see it didn&#39;t shift!  This is a first since my injury and made me very happy:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/om5ytckqthm81.png?width=1241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5283103c7d6423ab26e22ba887439f2a4dfdd337">https://preview.redd.it/om5ytckqthm81.png?width=1241&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5283103c7d6423ab26e22ba887439f2a4dfdd337
</a>
</p>
<p>
I got further proof of improvement from the PT today who said this was the first time she&#39;s seen it about 3/4 visible instead of fully on its edge and she said it was much easier for her to pull out completely.  I believe the 3/4 visible state is what most often creates the sensation of pressure when I first move after stretching it.  She said keep doing what I&#39;m doing and hopefully it will eventually stay out all the time.  Hope hope hope...

So much of your struggle reminds me of the things I went through. At 11 months, I was so miserable and the depression had gotten so bad, I was deep in the gutter. You&#39;ve done a great job describing the details of all the people, PT&#39;s, Gynos, hair etc. that you saw along the way. It gets both tiring and disappointing when the never-ending recovery goes on and on and on. She looks great in the pictures. I hope things keep improving, you deserve some respite.
</p>
<p>
Like you, I created my own custom device that turned into a whole series of them. I opted for 3D printing because I had the CAD skills. You can solve the surface issue by using a post-print acetone bath that creates a very smooth production finish.  I can see why you used Insta-morph though, it&#39;s great for all kinds of things and easy to work with.

Thank you.  I hope you&#39;ve healed by now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just mad that I blindly listened to the docs in this case.  Dr. Wittenberg, my old PT, my old gyn, two new gyns, two plastic surgeons all said don&#39;t touch it.  And all the while I kept thinking it&#39;s obviously being pulled out of place and will it really go back if I just wait?  I thought maybe there was swelling somewhere that would go down and let it return to normal but I was dubious about that.  I think my big mistake was not vocalizing my thoughts better and demanding answers.  But I also think that only the PTs really have much knowledge about the healing process and when I told the plastic surgeons what my old PT had said about healing needing some manipulation, they agreed but couldn&#39;t really say what to do.
</p>
<p>
What really bothers me so much right now is that I can&#39;t tell if anything I&#39;m doing is helping.  I feel like I need to lift the right side of the clit somehow on the assumption the flesh beneath it has contracted, but the only way I can do that is by pushing down on the left side of the clit as well as pushing the wall on the right side to drive enough flesh beneath the right side of the clit to push it up...  but doing all that creates a lot of pressure everywhere which will probably lead to swelling and I still can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m really accomplishing the goal of stretching up the right side.
</p>
<p>
My clit splint keeps slipping upward which may be making things worse as it puts pressure on the wrong areas and I can&#39;t hold it down in place constantly.  Although now that I think about it, it might work to create an umbrella of plastic at the highest point of the fin such that panties will better help apply downward pressure.  Hmmm...

I was curious about what you meant by &#34;compacted hair&#34;?  Was this just a clump of hair pushed to the base of your vaginal canal with the dilator?

Yep, exactly that.  You can see photos of it in part 6:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/qldmt7/part_6_had_pptppvpptv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/qldmt7/part_6_had_pptppvpptv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg/
</a>
</p>
<p>
Also, just read some of your other posts...  So sorry you had such terrible experiences.  I agree with you that most people won&#39;t post when they have bad experiences.  It&#39;s really depressing to post about some of my experiences and they haven&#39;t even been that bad.  I talked to one person in private a couple years ago and she not only didn&#39;t want to talk publicly about her long healing/complications but she didn&#39;t want me to describe them to anyone to warn people away from the surgeon because she was afraid the surgeon would recognize her by her symptoms or something.  I didn&#39;t really understand her reasoning but I respected her wishes.
</p>
<p>
When you were talking about dilating you mentioned using surgilube and I wanted to mention I used that once years ago for urethral sounding and it caused pain.  It has antibiotics in it that irritates skin with some people.  So you might want to switch to KY Jelly (thicker) or ID Glide (thinner), if you haven&#39;t already.

I switched to lifelube for a long time, then to coconut oil last year after the suggestion by my gyno. That&#39;s all Ive used for the last 8 months. I love that stuff.

You know, Im the only person who has come forward about Gallagher, as well. And I mean --REALLY come forward. People bitch publicly, but I heard from so many others that won&#39;t say a word because they are embarrassed or don&#39;t want to rock the boat. I won&#39;t break anyone&#39;s confidence, but my story has stopped so many people from making the same mistake. It&#39;s been worth it.

Does your clit still have full sensation with it tucked in a little? If so and it’s not causing pain, I wanna say that I think it still looks great! Like if you didn’t see the before pictures you wouldn’t think anything of it.
</p>
<p>
Also so weird you’ve had so many people tell you they’d never seen compacted hair in a patient before. I’m going to bring this back up to the providers I work with and see what they think.

I thiiiink it&#39;s still full sensation but I haven&#39;t tried using it for its intended purpose to be sure.  I agree it doesn&#39;t look terrible... but it does cause pain now and then because it&#39;s being pushed out of place.  It would probably stop hurting eventually once it was that way long enough but I really don&#39;t want it to be stuck this way.  The longer I squished it with closed legs, the more it was turning sideways and looking stranger and more swollen on the left side.  It&#39;s harder to reach the part of it with the most sensation the farther sideways it&#39;s stuck since the edge of it doesn&#39;t have as much sensation.
