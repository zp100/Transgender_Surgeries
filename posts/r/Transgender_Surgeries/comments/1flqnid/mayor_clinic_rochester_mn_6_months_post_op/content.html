Those results are impressive. Iâ€™ve only heard nightmare stories from SRS patients of the Mayo Clinic.

Yeah i have heard a few and mostly it being necrosis or severe dehiscence. I was very careful and used examination gloves and sterile abdominal pads to check and clean my incisions after dilation. Photos others have shared I&#39;ve seen people poking and spreading their labia with bare hands, and dilating on towels in bed. Everything has germs so always try to use medical grade supplies if possible.

I think they don&#39;t have details because they&#39;ve only really been doing the procedure for a decade or so and also to avoid conservative harassment. Dr Fahradyan studied the procedure in NY at a hospital that&#39;s familiar with it. As for why I chose them, they were in network with my insurance,  didn&#39;t have a super long wait list, and relatively close to my home. I think they did a good job and the staff were super friendly. My only regret is not being a very healthy weight before hand.
