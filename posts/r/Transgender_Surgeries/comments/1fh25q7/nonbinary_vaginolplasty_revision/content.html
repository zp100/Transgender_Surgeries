Thanks for posting! It&#39;s not often we see examples of vaginoplasty on nonbinary people or plus-size individuals.

You are most welcome.  Like I am feminizing (22months HRT) and eyeing FFS though with a twist cause of genderfluid.
</p>
<p>
But I like think it&#39;s important that people with differing transition journies share so others can be made aware ya know?
</p>
<p>
And especially with size, there really aren&#39;t many like me, I there isn&#39;t even a porn category for someone like me yet 🤣
</p>
<p>
Hoping to get some solid results from this revision so I can be like &#34;look people it works&#34;

I have my surgery In 4 months and I’m literally on a diet and workout daily so I can get the surgery 😭 which is really tough! So I’m really happy that they didn’t require that for you 🤍 congratulations!!!

You got this! 🥰🤗 You could inquire about stopping your blocker if you are on one to give yourself a slight T boost to help the weight move a Lil faster.
</p>
<p>
I know my weight moved a lot faster off while I had my balls (was monotherapy) than it does now without T.

Who you booked with?

Thank you! 🥹 I have irregular hormone cycle due to my intersexuality, I’ve been plus size all my life so it’s kind of impossible for now but I lost 4kgs in 3 weeks, need to lose 15 more and then I’m ready for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I wonder why that is so… but you’re so lucky for getting it without weight loss 🤍
</p>
<p>
A clinic in Germany called Lubos. The doctor isn’t clear as yet, any of the doctors could do it cause you’re not allowed to pick one.

Oh I still ended up losing 40lbs for surgery, I was 370 when it was booked and lost 40 in a tad over 3 months. However it wasn&#39;t required. But I highly recommend most people get on a pro cardiovascular regime going into surgery.
</p>
<p>
Of all the people I know I carried myself very well immediately after the hospital and I attribute that fact to my routine leading up to.
</p>
<p>
Also that&#39;s great progress on your end!!! You will definitely make it! May need to eat fewer fun things just in case but you got this.
</p>
<p>
I let myself have just a bit of sugar so it wasn&#39;t so hard. those sweet tart mini chewys were my go-to. They didn&#39;t have to much sugar and it satisfied my need well enough (zero sugar candy is good as well)

🤗🤗🤗  I&#39;m glad I could help. Like I put a lot of work in order to have the success, I did lose 40lbs in the 3months after i got my date. So I definitely advocate anyone big to try to lose a few to help themselves out.
</p>
<p>
But the idea of &#34;well you need to earn the right to be rid of your dysphoria&#34; in 2024 is fucking disgusting. Cause that&#39;s what we are being told &#34;go lose a bunch of weight, prove you deserve it, and then talk to me again&#34;
</p>
<p>
I will gladly die on the hill that &#34;medicine should be practiced at the human level, and the patients health needs to be the focus&#34;

Where did you get your surgery, your BMI looks over 35.  My surgeon said I have to get down to 35BMI for surgery.  You look great!

I had bottom surgery with the same surgeon with BMI 39
</p>
<p>
BMI gatekeeping is just oudated bs, Ramineni has proven he can do this surgery on people far above most surgeons limits since he understands its medically necessary, not an elective.
</p>
<p>
So either Ramineni is somekind of ultra godlike surgeon, or BMI gatekeeping is overblown.

It is overblown. For top surgery at least, there is a huge amount of evidence that BMI gatekeeping is not needed. It&#39;s surgeons trying to cover their butts essentially

Like it&#39;s not bad to get the BMI info and then start from there but if they can cover your weight with a redact marker and have no idea then clearly BMI isn&#39;t the tool to be using. Like BMI wasn&#39;t even designed with this use in mind!
</p>
<p>
Some people just aren&#39;t well enough but it&#39;s much more humane to tell a patient they need to make improvements based on actual data instead of telling a patient to &#34;prove they deserve to be rid of their dysphoria&#34;

I think BMI is generally a trash metric.

Most people over the age of like 12 have to watch what they eat. That definitely isn&#39;t a standard to measure others by.
</p>
<p>
If you are happy and healthy then we absolutely love that for you. But a lot of people would have to engage in unhealthy practices to get there for a system that doesn&#39;t even really require it, and it&#39;s important to acknowledge that.

oh i can understand, honestly since the day i born i was just eating recklessly, like when i was going highschool i would down 2 whole white bread daily, i didnt mind my sugar intake etc.
</p>
<p>
I guess a very fast metabolism helped me with maintaining a low weight, i&#39;m 180cm and going between around 65-70kg. Though i started college a year ago and since then i&#39;ve been trying to take care of myself better, limit sugar intake etc. Without my fast metabolism i guess i couldnt maintain that weight too i guess.

Oh I&#39;m not saying you couldn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just that life is hard and fast and plenty of people are looking to profit off of that. So yeah it could be harder for others to shrug off.

That&#39;s such a restrictive practice.  Seriously having a hard time wracking my brain around that one. Whenever anyone says &#34;oh here&#39;s the standard, let&#39;s aim for less&#34; they are just trying to find a way to exclude the most people without being to obvious.
</p>
<p>
If most professionals are saying 30-32 (which is in itself problematic) what would be the point of saying 28?

Because of the risks. People who are at a higher BMI tend to have a more difficult recovery post-op and more complications.

I get that and I&#39;m saying it&#39;s ridiculous that they would. Since the goal should be to practice medicine to help people.

Agreed to point. I am not sure why i am getting downvoted on a factual medical requirement and laid down by the National Health Service, UK.  I can not change their reasoning. I assume it is the medium they require for Psychical Health.

You&#39;re getting down voted because your statement is pointing out that BMI only requirements are ludi.
</p>
<p>
And I tend to get down voted for being a fat person that got a pussy, so you&#39;re getting hit extra 🙃

<p>
You should eventually end up with a positive ratio. 😅

Because it&#39;s the surgeon&#39;s license that&#39;s on the line every time they decide to perform a surgery, so they take precautions to ensure it&#39;s low risk or that risk is minimized of any complications. Stop playing the victim!

Oh they can do whatever they want, as you said it&#39;s there license to protect, and if they don&#39;t feel confident they can do the job, they shouldn&#39;t take it. I have no issue with all that.
</p>
<p>
The problem is BMI is not an indicator of health. It&#39;s arbitrary and is only useful for mass population surveying.
</p>
<p>
Blood pressure, resting heart rate, A1C these are the kind of things that paint the picture of health. If someone high BMI but they blood pressure is like 100/66 resting heart rate around 70 and A1C below 5 then clearly the raw BMI isn&#39;t telling us anything.
</p>
<p>
There also is no correlation between bmi and rate of failure for this surgery.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally surgery on heavier people is much more risky, but the biggest factor is weather or not we are closing wounds with staples that&#39;s what the Traditional risks are based off of...ain&#39;t no gender affirming surgeon making a pussy with staples, also great effort is taken in this surgery to be minimally evasive and bloody.
</p>
<p>
So to sum up. It makes sense from a individual doctor, it makes less sense to have as a policy for a Healthcare system. Every Body is different.
</p>
<p>
And if my labs were bad, and I couldn&#39;t take care of myself, my surgeon would have turned me down, so it&#39;s about doing medicine at the human level.

BMI isn&#39;t a good indicator for those who have high muscle composition since muscle weighs more than fat, but based on your picture, I can make the assumption that your body fat is due to a high amount of fat which increases the risk of diabetes and other conditions. It&#39;s not guaranteed, you are just at a higher risk, and as I pointed out in the article, complications are higher in those with excessive body fat. If I was a part of the medical team, I wouldn&#39;t take the risk based on the article and BMI. (And yes, I will be a medical professional in a few more years)

Guess Dr. Ramineni is a godlike surgeon since he casually does this surgery on plenty of high BMI people without any issue.
</p>
<p>
Surgeries happen on high bmi people every day, some simply like to pretend trans surgeries arent medically necessary to hide their own lack of skill in that area, especially if they are used to only operate on people with little fat down there, so using &#34;BMI means you are statistically at higher risk&#34; means very little when you see some surgeon do it without issues, especially since we sign and accept possible risks anyway because it is this important to us.
</p>
<p>
Continue beating the same drum about BMI

You see the flaw in your statement, right?
</p>
<p>
I could be at risk is not the same as actual doing the labs getting the data and seeing what my actual health situation is. As I mentioned else where, a BP of 100/66, resting heartrate between 60-70 and A1C below 5 are indicators of strong health and are based on my actual body.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s reasonable to see someone with a High BMI and start doing your due diligence, however Diabeties isn&#39;t exclusively a fat thing, hypertension isn&#39;t exclusively a fat thing, heart problems isn&#39;t exclusively a fat thing.
</p>
<p>
So it&#39;s more important to take your patients health into consideration at the human level not at the mass survey level.
</p>
<p>
My BMI was 53 the first time, and I carried myself better than a lot of people with a BMI of 23.
</p>
<p>
Obviously if a doctor is uneasy because they aren&#39;t sure of themselves, then yeah don&#39;t do the job, but don&#39;t use a highly flawed system as a cop out. It&#39;s 2024, use science.

Glad I could help. 🥰
</p>
<p>
Between WPATH8 and some surgeons understanding the point of medicine it&#39;s become much more reason for individuals that are not strictly binary trans to get the help they need.
</p>
<p>
Weather it&#39;s a nonbinary person, a binary trans person who has a clearly defined need and not the ability to wait for some arbitrary wait period or even masc identifying AMAB individuals with bottom dysphoria, we are at a good place where more of us can be recognized for our needs.
</p>
<p>
Now I definitely don&#39;t recommend people get fat then have bottom surgery, but it&#39;s nice to know that someone like me in that regard can also be allowed an opportunity to fight.
</p>
<p>
(My recommendation to anyone is always seek therapy and try to get a physically fit as they can while engaging in this process as it is serious) but yeah for me I still have a long journey ahead of me and i have other procedures to consider, but even though I have had my challenges this has been the best decision I&#39;ve ever made. And from this decision I have begone to fight for myself so much harder than I ever have.

Nope. As long as the pre labs look good, I was able to take clean take care of myself and dilate it was all good.
</p>
<p>
The pre labs would help with assesting weather anesthesia could be a problem and like your heart and such. And my health is phenomenal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m was 330 at 5&#34;5 originally and probably a tad lower this time though I would say my health had improved from the first surgery even.
</p>
<p>
There are some increased risks of healing being a bit slower though with this surgery slow isn&#39;t always bad.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon has a in and out approach which is great for bigger people. I was under for 1.5hours the first time and about 60minutes yesterday. So that&#39;s very little time under anesthesia and in the strunips and obviously less exposure to blood loss in surgery as well.
</p>
<p>
My BMI is like 53 but he&#39;s worked on people around 60. That said, if you can lose a few definitely do so and make sure you do a ton of walking, 1 for the cardiovascular but also the gravity gets turned up massively post op.
</p>
<p>
I was able to take care of myself completely solo once I left the hospital.

One of my fav things that Dr. Ramineni brought up in my consultation was him saying how he doesn&#39;t restrict based on BMI. I&#39;m not a bigger bodied person but several of my friends are and face medical discrimination constantly (some I&#39;ve witnessed in appointments with them). Most surgeons see the &#34;risk&#34; and don&#39;t want to risk being liable for complications. Just hearing Dr. R feel sympathy for people left to feel shamed out of getting a surgery they desperately need really hit home.
</p>
<p>
While it&#39;s clear with every conversation I&#39;ve had with Dr. R from consultation to pre/post op visits is he cares about the people&#39;s lives he&#39;s changing. I could see the glee in his eyes any time I asked him/his team members if I could give them a hug for changing my life post op. Both his team and him understand the impact that vaginoplasty can have in people&#39;s lives. Whether that person is thin or big n beautiful!!
</p>

Grats on your revision going well! I hope you have a speedy recovery and can finally get back to living your bombastic life! 🥰❤️

Exactly! He can be hard to get some answers out of but like he&#39;s also definitely autistic (not offical but like, you talked with him 🤣) so as someone that is as well I totally vibe with that. He also has room to be a bit more hands on after. However he&#39;s very reachable and If local, very easy to get in for checkups and followup care.
</p>
<p>
Also PS. I appreciate the compliment 🥰 though I think I mostly captured it&#39;s good side. I will say though even though there is way to much excess (it is a very esthetic way for it to look 😅) so I can&#39;t wait to see how it looks with the majora reduced and everything else done.

Thank you 🥰🥰🥰 Ramineni is literally a Gem.  He could be a bit better about getting some answers, but I&#39;m also pretty sure he&#39;s autistic 😅. It&#39;s evident he cares through the whole process. I wish I were local cause he&#39;s extra available to help in that case.
</p>
<p>
Also PS, I appreciate the compliment but I must be capturing Benjamin&#39;s good side 🤣 I&#39;m hoping with the majora being a strong emphasis of this revision, we totally nailed this.

Thank you 🥰 He really does care. I&#39;m not trying to glaze him but he was way ahead of WPATH as far as the patients he would help.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s also been helping AMAB - masc identifying nonbinary men (with bottom dysphoria) before WPATH8 recognized nonbinary people. So he cares.
