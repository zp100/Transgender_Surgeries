I‚Äôm going to try and take pictures of the clinics/hospitals if they let me and try to post it here... BUT I‚Äôve also never been to Thailand before.. is there anything worth seeing?

Tons of stuff worth seeing. I just got back from surgery with Chett in Bangkok. I didn&#39;t get to see a whole lot (because of recovery), but my wife did. Here are some things to look into:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Floating markets - There are a bunch. We went to
<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/damnoen-saduak-floating-market.htm">Damnoen Floating Market
</a>
. It was a neat experience.
</li>
<li>
Temples - There are tons. At least 40 or 50. The ones most people go see are The Grand Palace and Wat Prakeaw. My wife did not see those, but instead she went to 5 ones outside the city and had a great time.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/rot-fai-market-ratchada.htm">Train Night Market
</a>
- I wasn&#39;t able to go see this but my wife said it was pretty neat.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bangkok.com/shopping-mall/seacon-square.htm">Seacon Square Mall
</a>
- This is a huge 6 or 7 floor mall the size of a football field. Lots of shopping, lots of food, neat to walk around and see.
</li>
</ul>

Thanks! I‚Äôll definitely check some of these out!
</p>
<p>
How was Chett? I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things, but I‚Äôve also heard his clinic is in kind of weird part of Bangkok?

His clinic is an extremely narrow building in the outskirts of Bangkok. You&#39;ll see.

It was great. My results look amazing and I am healing really well (I am 4 weeks post op). His clinic on the outside looks kind of dumpy, but inside is really nice.

Here is a video I took arriving at the clinic:

What part of Thailand? I traveled the Mae Hong Son loop and enjoyed my time there, so I can give a couple recommendations for that area if you&#39;re interested in traveling to the north.

I think mostly just around Bangkok?, I‚Äôm only there for a week to mostly just consult with the surgeons, but I‚Äôll probably try to sightsee as well.
</p>
<p>
I think I‚Äôm also gonna be traveling north of Bangkok to Chonburi? Wherever Suporns clinic is

I can&#39;t tell you anything about Bangkok, I just had a connecting flight there, so I&#39;ve never really been.  I recommend visiting a wat, the art in them is usually magnificent and as long as you&#39;re respectful, you can learn a fair amount. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of beaches to see near bangkok too!

The Grand Palace. It‚Äôs like the #1 architectural tourist attraction in Bangkok. All the tourists make it a point to visit there. Not visiting the Grand Palace is like going to Paris and not visiting the Eiffel Tower!  The Palace is in the heart of the city though, and Chet‚Äôs clinic is like in the suburbs, so it‚Äôll take an hour or more to get there by taxi.

I assume you are doing this so you can pick a surgeon? How do you expect to judge among them?
</p>
<p>
I thought about doing his myself, but I lack confidence in being able to do so. I think I could pick the nicest, or most charismatic surgeon, but not the best. I don&#39;t have the technical knowledge. And it&#39;s hard to judge what the are telling you without some serious expertise in the area, and even the immnot sure they would tell you enough.
</p>
<p>
Apart from holiday stuff I&#39;m not sure what i could see that would influence my decision that I didn&#39;t areadt know. There Chett with his private clinic, which is quite, but no one has ever died. Suporn and PAI have decent hospitals.
</p>
<p>
Dr Sutin is said to be very nice, and Suporn not very talkative. But so what?
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s enough photos around that you can know what to expect there.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s someone who did this and wen to PAI. Possibly for different reasons that most of us would.

1) This is probably the most major surgery I‚Äôll ever have in my life. I feel more comfortable consulting in person vs online, plus it‚Äôs a lot easier to ask relevant questions and I feel like surgeons are more honest in person tbh.
</p>
<p>
2) I would rather have a feel for the hospital/clinic in person.. yeah there‚Äôs pictures and videos... but ultimately that‚Äôs not really gonna tell you the whole story.
</p>
<p>
3) One of
<em>
Biggest
</em>
reasons I‚Äôm doing this in person is because I really want to get a feeling for the travel time and have an idea of what Thailand is like before I decide to have this
<em>
MASSIVE
</em>
surgery. I‚Äôm in U.S it‚Äôs an 18+ hour flight. I‚Äôd rather have a feeling for what that‚Äôs like.
</p>
<p>
4) yeah it‚Äôs a bit of a vacation too. I haven‚Äôt taken a vacation in years. Sue me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
Also I had FFS last year with the Facial Team in Marbella Spain, one of reasons I did decided to go with them is because I had been to Spain multiple times before and did a foreign exchange program there when I was in college.. so I felt comfortable having medical care in a country I knew well.

Are you going to stay in the hotels the surgeons use? I expect it would be very interesting to meet current patients, and you could probably arrange it here.
</p>
<p>
Just in case you&#39;ve not seen this

How did you find Facial Team? I&#39;m quite interested in them myself.

<p>
That‚Äôs a good idea actually! I‚Äôll try to see if I can do it.
</p>
<p>
I was consulting with FFS/SRS surgeons in the U.S and one of them mentioned Facial Team.
</p>
<p>
Out of all the surgeons I consulted with for FFS, Dr. Luis Captain came across as the most genuine and I felt like he legitimately wanted to help me instead of give me a sales pitch.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
They  specialize specifically FFS compared to a lot of other surgeons where they do a lot more then FFS  so I felt that was a huge benefit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Recovery was a breeze, they check in on you daily for a week and a half, and they Also brushed my hair , gave  head massages and offered acupuncture to help with recovery.. Prob wasn‚Äôt super necessary.. but tbh I felt like it helped a ton those first couple of days.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Marbella is obviously super beautiful and the weather is always amazing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I have virtually 0 scarring.. in FACT I had no visible scarring after 3 days.. the reason...is compared to a lot of other ffs surgons.. they‚Äôre going through the top of your scalp vs the top of the forehead.. I‚Äôm sure this is a lot more difficult to do.. but It leaves you with no visible scars which is awesome.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is a negative though... I‚Äôm definitely super happy and I feel a lot better about my face then before ffs.. but this is something that i think a lot of other patients have said as well..
</p>
<p>
They‚Äôre almost.. like
<em>
TOO
</em>
subtle.. I mean it‚Äôs virtually impossible to tell I had surgery... which is really the goal here... but I feel like they could have been a bit more aggressive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
