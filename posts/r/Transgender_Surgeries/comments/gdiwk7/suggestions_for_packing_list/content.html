My surgeon called me informing me that the hospital is allowing her to preform 2 surgeries for GRS/ GCS on June 4. She gave me a list of what I need to pack, but was wondering what everyone here recommends. I will be traveling from IL to Ohio. Thank you.

My surgeon said not to worry about pads, underwear, pee pads or lube. She will be providing pads, disposable underwear, and pee pads.
</p>

I bought a donut seat. I am trying it out now to make sure it is comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the extension cord idea. I will pack one.

Also extra non-stick gauze, and puppy pads.

Not to impugn anyone‚Äôs integrity here, but (Edit) the only puppy pads I know of are specifically made with a scent attractant for dogs to draw them to the pad to relieve themselves. If there are the unscented variety out there, I‚Äôm not aware and offer my apology.
</p>
<p>
My suggestion is to use the CVS Pharmacy Health Day &amp; Night Maximum Absorbency Underpads X-Large, 18CT available here:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-day-night-maximum-absorbency-underpads-x-large-18ct-prodid-512509">https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-day-night-maximum-absorbency-underpads-x-large-18ct-prodid-512509</a>
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve used these pads in the past and they work very well and are relatively inexpensive. CVS will also ship them to you.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your surgery. I‚Äôm happy for you and wish you the best‚ù£Ô∏è ü§ós
