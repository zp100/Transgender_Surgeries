Hi there, so, im trying to find information on my potential surgeon, Dr Keiran Hart. Ive met him once, and Ive seen results of his work. He has said he used to practice in a London clinic performing GCS quite a bit, but is now in Australia (where i am).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If anyone has had experience with him i would LOVE to get in touch with you, as the one person Ive &#34;spoken&#34; to, through a third party, has only said that she is happy with the results. I wanna know more. A LOT more, such as: Who he trained with, how many surgeries hes done, how often complications have arisen etc etc.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Some of these questions and questions like them could be answered by him, but I&#39;d like the communities input/review.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

Girlfriend had a zero depth with him in November. No complications and very happy with his work and him as a surgeon. She has no idea how many he has done nor his complication rates. Other girls in Canberra have also stated they are pleased with the results. I personally have only heard gòod things about him.
</p>
<p>
On a side note; I personally wouldnt have GRS in Australia due to the cost and the general lack of runs on the board. I personally believe Thailand is a better and cheaper option. They are a couple of surgeon in Thailand that have performed over 4,000 GRS.

Ive heard only good things about him too, however i am going full depth.
</p>
<p>
Runs on the board?
</p>
<p>
With the covid stimulus and super access, im able to afford the cost, i have family and friends in canberra and live 3 hrs away, so my costs are gonna be less than 19K.
</p>
<p>
Ive yet to find an overseas surgeon where i can get all that for less.
</p>
<p>
Also, what makes thailand better? I know that colon graft vaginoplasty is an option, but im not exactly too keen on that technique. It doesnt seem as reliable, although ive only recently heard of it.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the info tho :)

There&#39;s plenty of surgeons in Thailand where you can get it for less. You can do it for US$2300 if you want.

So I have talked with him before and plan to see him again at the end of the year... Hopefully to get things more rolling. Sorry to say I don&#39;t have alot to add other than he seems like his heart is in the right place and like a good person which is nice. I would love to hear input from anyone else much like yourself.

yeah, im seeing him in a few months myself, and yes he is nice, and very sure of his work. tbh the fact that hes a urologist by trade makes him much more appealing.
