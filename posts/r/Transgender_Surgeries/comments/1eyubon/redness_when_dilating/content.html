Hey all,
</p>
<p>
I had PPV 3 months ago, and sometimes when I dilate the fluid that comes out has a pink tinge to it - ranging from none through quite pink, but never at outright bleeding.
</p>
<p>
Is this something to be concerned about? Is it likely to be granulation? Is it just part of the healing process?
</p>

Probably granulation.  Have it checked at your next appointment if that will be happening soon.  If not, you may want to try and schedule something, as the granulation tissue can be sensitive and cause discomfort during dilation.

Is it something that needs to be treated, or does it heal on its own? I&#39;ll have to go to a gyno.

It can clear up on its own in some instances, but it is usually simpler to go to a doctor to confirm it is granulation, and then have a simple treatment (typically silver nitrate) to help clear it up.  It can take more than one treatment though.

I had PPV 3 months ago too. A few weeks back I had that light pink color but not deep red like blood every time I dilated. Ended up being granulation which was treated.
</p>
<p>
Funny enough, I had some pink again earlier this week but then it stopped ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
Do you see your surgeon often or someone else that can look at the canal? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything to freak out about since it‚Äôs not deep red that won‚Äôt stop bleeding (not a doctor though) but still worth getting checked out in case it‚Äôs a mild case of granulation.

yeah turns out I jsut have granulation that comes and goes. I had surprise bleeding the other day (unrelated to granulation) that stopped after a while.  As you say, it just stops :)
