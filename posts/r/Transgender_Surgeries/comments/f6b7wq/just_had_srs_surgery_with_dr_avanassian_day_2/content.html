Day 2:
</p>
<p>
Right now I am feeling truly blessed and happy. Dr. Avanassian is probably the warmest and sweetest doctor I have ever encountered. On the morning of the surgery at Mount Sinai, she sat right next to me explaining everything that will happen, and asked if I had any questions. She was wearing a sweater, jeans, and shoes, and felt like your best friend, not a surgeon who is about to operate on you.
</p>
<p>
The surgical room can look pretty intimidating, and honestly, the most painful part (about a 6) was getting the anesthesia IV in. I was out in seconds, and when I woke up I felt kind of disoriented. I was carted to my room (all SRS patients get private rooms and they look like hotel suits!) and at first felt queasy, but I found rest to be the best medicine for that. Nurses are constantly checking in with you, taking vitals, giving pain medication, and giving you food (this morning I had pancakes and scrambled eggs!)
</p>
<p>
Pain is very minimal, about a 2 at most. Sleeping and eating has been no problem for me. Today around 1pm I will begin trying to walk. Mount Sinai has a very lax policy for visitors since you are in a private room. My surgery went fantastic. I am at full depth, and have been told it looks beautiful. My dressings are excellent, with minimal swelling.
</p>
<p>
Things that have been helpful:
</p>
<p>
1) Drinking out of straws helps a lot since you are lying down.
</p>
<p>
2) Avanassian has made it clear that aside from sitting completely upright, movement is perfectly fine.
</p>
<p>
3) Bring a comfort item. Whether it is a stuffed animal or favorite blankie, bringing something that comforts you helps a lot. I brought my teddy bear!
</p>
<p>
4) You are encouraged to eat anything.
</p>
<p>
5) Donâ€™t be afraid of asking people to do things for you! This is your time to rest and recover.
</p>
<p>
6) Have no fear about the surgery. It is nothing and it is over before you realize it. There is nothing to fear, and happiness and feelings blessed is on the other side!

Thank you for sharing this with us! So happy for you - I hope your recovery continues to go great.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering if you would answer two questions I have:
</p>
<p>
1) How has nausea been for you so far? I have a brain situation where I get light-headed easily, so I&#39;m worried that I might get that &#34;spinning&#34; sensation and have that lead to feeling nauseous.
</p>
<p>
2) How much sleep have you been able to get? I&#39;ve heard that some girls can only sleep for 2 hours or so at a time because of nurse checkups, which sounds like it would get old.
</p>

1) When I first got out of surgery I was nauseous. I was very thirsty and I drank water, but threw it up. The nurses put in my IV medication to reduce nausea. After napping I felt a lot better, and by this morning all nausea has subsided. I just walked for the first time, and you will be a little dizzy from laying down so much, but it subsided and went fine.
</p>
<p>
2) During the day yes, it is a bit difficult to sleep because of nurse checkups, but at night I got a full sleep. They know you need rest, and will not bother you when sleeping at night.

<p>
Can confirm. Also drink tons and tons of water. It is good for you and helps flush out the medication they used during the surgery. It will reduce your nausea and speed up your recovery.

<p>
Can confirm. I ate Bareburger fries a few hours after. I ate like 4 then passed out asleep.

I missed the fries part. I thought you ate four burgers post-surgery.

They looked great! My partner came with me, and she saw them as well. I remember my partner (who is cis) saying that her clit looks exactly like the ones in the picture! I just laughed. Avanassian and Ting both do bigger clitorises in their work, but I&#39;m sure you can request however you want your vagina to look like!

Congrats, I&#39;m so happy for you!
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ignore/pm, but I was wondering what your pre-op hair removal process was like? I am 95% sure I am going with Avanessian, and just curious how much hair removal you had to do, if you did laser vs. electro, how long it took, etc. Thank you so much and again congrats, I&#39;m so jealous &lt;3

Mount Sinai provides medical grade laser hair removal. Each session was once a month for like six months. It lasts for like 5 minutes, and yeah, it&#39;s a memorable experience for sure, but not unbearable. Any remaining hair they scrape off during surgery.

Are you out of state, and if so, did you schedule your surgery date after your first all day consult and was that first day consult with Avanessian? Or did you have to schedule another consult before scheduling surgery?

I live in NYC, so I am in state. The surgery is covered completely by New York Medicade.
</p>
<p>
Mount Sinai likes to do everything in-house through their transgender CTMS unit, so my first consultations were with their psychiatrist, social worker, and had to do a physical/ blood test. I literally picked up the phone in January 2019 and scheduled me to meet their team a week later. During this time, Mount Sinai provided a talk group for SRS patients, preparing everyone for surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had my consultation with Dr. Avanassian on June 2019. I got my surgery date a couple of days after through a phone call.
</p>
<p>
About three weeks before surgery, I had to do another physical and blood test. I had to update a few of my letters.
</p>
<p>
The whole process can be a bit overwhelming (especially for insurance), but my God has it been worth it!

Amazing, I wish you a speedy recovery! If you donâ€™t mind me asking, how was the whole process from hormones to SRS? Iâ€™m on NY state medical care and canâ€™t often find others whoâ€™ve gone this route.

Mount Sinai (Ting and Avanassian) explicitly tell you to stay on HRT throughout the surgery. They only asked me to stop Spiro a day before, and this is because it makes you pee.

That sounds wonderful. I&#39;m so happy it&#39;s gone so smoothly for you. This post really warmed my heart and made me feel optimistic about the procedure, since it is so terrifying. And honestly part of the terrifying part is that I feel like I don&#39;t have a choice in doing it. I need this, and one day I&#39;m going to get it, so it&#39;s so great to hear that it can go so well. Thank you for posting &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Side note, how is pooping? That feels like a genuinely scary part about the first couple of days/week.

Two days into recovery and I haven&#39;t pooped yet! I have a lot of gas, and feel kind of constipated. This is mainly from the anesthesia and pain killers. I&#39;ve been given stool softeners, and have slowly gotten used to passing gas again. Think of it as your body still waking up after shock. I&#39;m still exploring the limitations of my body of my recovery.

I want to stress how excellent and caring the staff is at Mount Sinai. They get it, and are very attentive of your needs. They are like angles.
