So the drs at GRS know I take suboxone but they do not seem concerned. What scares me is I read online that suboxone might make other opiates not work as well? I would hate to all of a sudden start feeling everything! Has anyone been through this? I was planning on trying to quit suboxone before my surgery not sure there is enough time though right now?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Does anyone know how long do we have to stay on opioids after SRS surgery?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Here is the thing I was never a drug addict or addicted to anything. I was on a herb called kratom that was supposed to be good for anxiety and depression. However, when I went to the doctor and told them about it they told me it was an opaite and put me on suboxone which is ten billion times more powerful to get off the kratom. So I got mixed up and stuck with suboxone.  I tried to get off but the w/ds are painful!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I  am only on 2mg of suboxone I know this is tiny dose but still suboxone makes it so other meds do not work. Can you imagine feeling everything when we wake up? So I have never been on any kind of other opiate other than suboxone. Other than PERCS for my hair transplant. Unless kratom is considered an opiate? I never tried oxy or heroin recreationally or medically that I am aware of? But the thing is when I did get my hair transplant in 2007 I was not on suboxone.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Right now  I am on a cancellation list for GRS in Montreal. I am hoping someone cancels before 2024 so I can get in. This time would be a good time for me to get surgery I have no job and a whole house to heal.

That’s quite worrying. They might be saying it’s safe rather than you’re not going to suffer badly. I’d ask to confirm they what they are prepared to give you for painkillers and check it’s reasonable. Get it in writing if you can. And once you have left the surgeon care can you get proper painkillers from your normal doctor?

I do not even know if my doctor would give me proper pain killers. When it comes to us suffering no one seems to care unless we are going to die? They are really careless when it comes to this stuff I noticed.

Are you on it due to recreational opiate use? Because if you are, is it safe to take opiates?
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s at least one case in the wiki of someone who had a huge tolerance to opiates and not getting adequate pain relief. Sounds pretty horrifying.

Nope I have never even tried an opiate like oxy or heroin before. I never had an issue with addiction. The doctors foolishly put me on suboxone because I fell for the kratom miracle medication for anxiety and depression.  One big mix up and being failed by the health system.
</p>
<p>
My Tolerance to opiates should be good but the naloxone in the suboxone might block some of the anti-pain effects. They are not worried because I am only on 2mg of suboxone. My Subooxone dr is not worried either he told me to just quit whenever I like. Like it is nothing. Quitting is painful.
</p>
<p>
Its like someone taking weed and then the doctors going OMG you should get off that lets put you on suboxone so you can quit weed. I think they make money off of us being on suboxone otherwise why would they do that? Its insanity.

From what I read opiate tolerance takes a very long time to go away, and doctors have a limit on how much they will give you even if it has little effect. I’ve no idea how this relates to suboxone.

This isn’t necessarily true in this case. If they have Suboxone in their system from being on it for a while using other opiates will not put them into PWDs. Also 2mg is a really low dose even though Suboxone is strong, they could easily punch through with something like Methadone or Fentanyl and maybe even high dose Oxycodone. I’d say stop taking the Subs for as long as you can, wait until your feeling withdrawals, then take whatever other opiate for a few days or however long needed. After that wait until you’re feeling withdrawals again then take your Suboxone. I’m not a doctor but pretty experienced with opiates as a 5+ year user.

As long as the people taking care of you know you are on suboxone, you shouldn’t have much to worry about. Technically, yea, opiates may not work as well, but only at standard starting doses.  Because your suboxone also contains naloxone, you have to give higher doses of opiate. Starting at low doses is still advised, but you and your nurses should feel confident to increase your dose of opiate faster than most people in order to achieve significant pain relief.  Please don’t try to quit suboxone before surgery without direct help from your doctor. It will likely make things way MORE painful as your body is used to having the suboxone in it.  If you want to chat further, feel free to DM me. I am a hospital pharmacist.

They must have had a lot of experience in this before as well? I really don&#39;t want to be on super high doses of opiates I thought maybe getting off my suboxone and switching to something else before surgery? I wonder how long we need opiate  s for while recovery? Most Cosmetic recovery I needed percs a few days but this is much more nvasive.

Well why not just taper down the suboxone?
</p>
<p>
But yes switching to Methadone will make your treatment easier. Because methadone isn‘t as strongly blocking receptors.
</p>
<p>
Also you are addicted to opioids and were. Kratom contains alkaloids that work exactly the same as buprenorphine. Partial mu opioid receptor agonists. Hence the withdrawal after li t term use of it. It’s an addictive opioid.
</p>
<p>
If you can, best course of action is to go into any planned surgery completely clean. Second best option is switching to methadone or whatever other full mu opioid agonists are offered were you live. Codeine, DHC, morphine. They all work.
</p>
<p>
If neither switching the substitution drug or tapering to zero is possible, you can still go into surgery while using suboxone.
</p>
<p>
you will require higher doses A simply because of your dependence to opioids, and B because both buprenorphine nor naloxon don‘t like letting go of the mu opioid receptors.
</p>
<p>
Hence the important part being them knowing what you are on, so they can adjust the dose up much higher than for an opioid naive patient.
</p>
<p>
Additionally the subutex is problematic because of its long duration of action: other opioids are reduced in effectiveness for up to 48 hours after your last dose.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it‘s perfectly possible to give adequate pain control after surgery irrespective of the opioid you are using. It just requires higher doses.
</p>
<p>
As for the post surgical recovery: it varies drastically. Some people are fine without opioids a day or two post surgery, others require them for a week or more.
</p>
<p>
Please talk to both your surgical team and the substitution clinic again about switching you to a different drug though. Every single available option is going to make life much easier for you.
</p>
<p>
Also yes Kratom is again for a fact an opioid. Do you‘ve been on opioids plenty of times.
</p>
<p>
It‘s just not an opiate. Which is the class of opioids which are derived from the alkaloids from the poppy plant. So morphine, codeine, and their chemical derivatives like heroin, oxycodone or the suboxone both ingredients.
</p>
<p>
Fentanyl, methadone, tramadol, pethidine are all opioids like the alkaloids in Kratom, but not opiates.
</p>
<p>
The commonly used opioids during surgery, like sufentanil or remifentanil can easily overpower all the opioids you used recreationally and to treat your opioid addiction currently.
</p>
<p>
But post surgical pain control is much easier to do if you are switched to methadone or other available substitution drugs that do not contain buprenorphine.

I see so being off suboxone is best I think? I do not want to be addicted to methadone.  Would perks or codeine be a less strong drug?

It doesn‘t matter which drug. You are already ‚addicted‘ to buprenorphine, methadone is just a different opioid.
</p>
<p>
The potency of opioids just means how many mg you need of each for the desired effect. You can get as addicted to codeine as you can to heroin.
</p>
<p>
Percocet are a combination medication of oxycodone with paracetamol. They are absolutely not a viable alternative. Long term high dose use of paracetamol is extremely destructive to your liver.
</p>
<p>
Do not make the switch by buying off the black market.
</p>
<p>
Go to whoever prescribes the suboxone, and have them explain the different options they provide.
</p>
<p>
Switching to methadone is not going to make you any more addicted than you are now.
</p>
<p>
As long as you don‘t increase your dose.
</p>
<p>
Your current 2 mg of buprenorphine are equal to about 15 mg of Methadone. You might have to be put on a slightly lower or higher dose for the same effect.
</p>
<p>
But again, don‘t do this by buying black market. It‘s gonna end very badly. Do this by talking to your current provider.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively the clinic you are doing the surgery at can also take you in patient a day or two before the surgery and switch you over to whatever opioid they intend to use for pain control, prior to the surgery. That way they know your exact base line dose for no withdrawals.
</p>
<p>
But forget about any one opioid being more addictive than another. They all do the same as far as addiction is concerned.
</p>
<p>
You can be extremely addicted to the weakest potency opioids, because you are simply taking a ton of them.

Hope you don’t mind me asking but I’m supposed to have a hysterectomy and my doctors used to have me take a different opiate for a eeek before and then during and after my surgery’s in the past. This time my doctor said that wasn’t standard anymore. What would the plan be for pain. I don’t know if I misunderstood but it sounded like he was just going to use the subutex and not give me anything else for pain. I definitely don’t want to be put through that torture and it seems worrisome to me

My doctors all keep saying suboxone won&#39;t block the opiates, it o ly last 34 hours, when I know for a fact that is not true! I had a section 5 years ago and the block didn&#39;t work on one half. They even tried Dilaudid and it did nothing. Now I&#39;m having major major abdomen surgery with drains and all, but they keep saying it won&#39;t block anything. They e told me it&#39;s going to be very painful and I&#39;m so scared!! I was able to get down to about 3/4 of a 8mg pill a day, but that&#39;s as low as I&#39;ve gotten. And surgery is in 3 days.

They’d likely recommend she taper herself down to a micro dose or stop it completely. No physician I’ve worked with would pump a patient full of high dose narcs to combat naloxone because 9 times out of 10 it’ll just result in the patient getting really sick (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea without any real pain relief). Each doctor is different though sooooo maybe 🤷‍♀️. It sounds as though OP had an opioid addiction at some point and I’m sure if the surgeon disregards that fact, her PCP won’t and will likely recommend only methadone or tramadol to manage pain.

You’d be so much better off of a doctor would switch you to something like oxycodone a while before surgery so you could make sure your body handles the switch well.
</p>
<p>
You’re going to need opiates after surgery. Suboxone will block the effects of those opiates. You shouldn’t take them together at all.
</p>
<p>
To put it simply, you NEED to switch your meds before surgery. You’re looking at a complicated mess of pain and/or withdrawals otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Another key detail to know.. if you go Through withdrawal while in tons of pain, it will literally amplify pain signals in your body and make it twice as bad as just going through it sober.
</p>
<p>
I say this all to you as a trans woman. As someone who has taken oxycodone for 5 straight years and felt it all. I’m someone who has had multiple surgeries and recoveries and painful conditions. I’ve had cancer.

You need to seriously discuss this with your doctors or surgeons. I’m not trying to scare you but that sounds bad.

Well of course, it’s primarily prescribed to treat opioid addiction and contains naloxone; ideally someone whose taking the drug shouldn’t be on any type of opioid (before I’m downvoted for being “judgmental”) people tend to become really sick when they attempt to take an opioid while also taking suboxone.
</p>
<p>
In my 5 years of nursing experience the only people that receive Suboxone are people with severe opioid addictions. You stated that you were prescribed it because you were self-medicating with Kratom for anxiety, but unless you were abusing that and taking exceptionally high doses, it’s a medication that can just be discontinued with minimal to no discomfort.

People don&#39;t get sick from taking opioids while on Suboxone.  Quit spreading misinformation.  You get sick when you take Suboxone too early when coming off of opioids.

You’re wrong. It’s not “misinformation” I am a nurse practitioner and prior to entering into that field of nursing I was a registered nurse for 7 years. I’m so sorry that you and your Reddit degree &amp; ego are upset to be incorrect about something. Taking an opioid while also taking Suboxone can cause precipitated withdrawal, in smaller words for you, they’ll feel very very very bad.
</p>
<p>
Going forward let’s not comment misinformation masked in shadiness based on opinions you have to posts that are nearly a year old. It’s unbecoming. Get yourself together sweetheart.

NO YOU ARE WRONG. You shouldn&#39;t be a nurse. If you are already on Suboxone and you take another opioid, it will NOT EVER make you sick. It&#39;s when you are on a full agonist, then switch to Suboxone before you are in full withdrawals. I&#39;m so sick of &#34;nurses&#34; thinking because they&#39;ve been doing it for &#34;7 years&#34; (barely any time anyway, weird flex), when we have lived it for decades. YOU are the reason we can&#39;t get proper pain management.

Facts !!! so my last dose of .25 suboxone was at 11:30am yesterday. It’s currently 2:09am and I’m using m30’s real oxycodone… and going very slow I just relapsed off of suboxone I’ve only been using it 3 days lol  and 2nd day I took no more daily then half a film orally  (8mg/2mg) if that… made me feel an uncontrollable nod I didn’t like that. I’ve been on 30mg k9 and mbox 30’s for 4 yrs now and want to quit (smoking them yeah I knoe) so I started suboxone 3 days ago but gave it up yesterday morning with my final dose of .25 .. so she is wrong you can’t go into PW if on suboxone or only 14 hours since my last does of suboxone and I’m using 30mg opiate IR M30

That seriously isn&#39;t true. Precipitated WD only happens when you start taking Bupe before you&#39;re at least a six on the COWS scale, aka withdrawal from your last opiate. This can be as short as 12 hours for heroin and 72+ hours depending on what fentalogue or shitty Nitazenes are in your supply. And then you can use the Bernese induction method to slowly come on.
</p>
<p>
When you&#39;re
<em>
on
</em>
subs, you don&#39;t get sick starting to take other opiates other than nausea, constipation, vomiting, feeling sleepy. Same reaction you&#39;ll have with a mild overdose. That said once you&#39;ve hit 8mg most of your receptors will be filled with Bupe and you won&#39;t feel the opiates for 12 hours, will feel them less at 24 hours and by 37-48 hours it&#39;ll be out of your system.
</p>
<p>
My GP legitimately thinks that the time release on tablets is in the coating, you&#39;re just an NP and should stay in your lane unless you actually work with addiction. Hell, as unsavoury as it is, it&#39;s helpful to head over to Bluelight, Erowid and the Heroin subreddit to see how wrong you are if you don&#39;t want to believe me. I&#39;ve helped with getting enough people clean to be intimately familiar with this. Former drug/alcohol counselor working in a clinic.
</p>
<p>
That said it&#39;s absolutely fucking insane that OP was put on 2mg for taking Kratom. If they have anxiety and depression, they should have been tapered off with codeine then therapy/anxiety and depression meds. Now they&#39;re likely still dependent and I don&#39;t think doctors realise how strong and long the withdrawal is. Most people in recovery are terrified of it and Methadone/Fent withdrawal because the longer the half life, the longer the withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
Please listen to addicts and people with experience in the field. You can also use this great tool called Google. See;

You&#39;re exactly right and that person has no clue what they&#39;re talking about. Sad that a medical &#34;professional&#34; spread lies with so much confidence and authority. This is why addicts get nervous going to the hospital because of rude, ill informed medical staff like that who patronize them.

You are wrong. I was an addict for 4 years and you have it backwards. You get precipitated withdrawals when you take Suboxone too soon after your last opioid dose, not the other way around. The fact that you spread misinformation so confidently and patronized that person (when they were actually the one who was right) is extremely embarrassing. I&#39;m cringing.
</p>
<p>
Literally just google it. If you knew the science behind this then you&#39;d realize what you&#39;re saying makes NO sense. Suboxone kicks off any drug attached to your opioid receptors all at once, that&#39;s what causes precipitated wds. Taking oxycodone 5 minutes after taking a Suboxone would do absolutely nothing because Suboxone blocks opiates from attaching to those receptors. You don&#39;t get high, you don&#39;t get any pain relief, you don&#39;t get withdrawals, nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
As a nurse you should know what you&#39;re talking about, and if you don&#39;t, don&#39;t act like you do because it&#39;s dangerous to spread misinformation as a medical professional. Please have some humility and do some more research before you go around speaking to people like this. Nursing school does not mean you have a medical degree, let alone a degree in opioid addiction. Maybe you should try listening to addicts because sometimes we know what we&#39;re talking about!

You are describing this terribly for somebody who’s a nurse practitioner lmfao. This is NOT the case, as a professional in the medical field you must stop spreading misinformation bro, it’s really fucked up. Taking suboxone too early during a detox when AN INDIVIDUAL IS DEPENDENT ON OPOIDS, can cause precipitated withdrawal. Not “taking an opioid while on suboxone can cause precipitated withdraw”. You sound really uneducated, like the doctors at my hometown ER, useless.

Based on my 20 min of research, I don’t think this is correct.
</p>
<p>
It’s quite difficult to find anything that explicitly says what happens if you’re on Suboxone first, but these do
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bicyclehealth.com/suboxone-faq/what-happens-if-you-take-opioids-while-on-suboxone" rel="nofollow">https://www.bicyclehealth.com/suboxone-faq/what-happens-if-you-take-opioids-while-on-suboxone

</a>
.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In both cases there is no precipitated withdraw. In the second there’s the risk of opioid poisoning.
</p>
<p>
This makes sense because looking at what causes it
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is where the danger of precipitated withdrawal arises. With buprenorphine’s strong receptor-binding affinity, when given to a person who is already addicted to heroin, the buprenorphine removes and then replaces the heroin molecules that have already attached to the person’s opioid receptors in the brain. As a result of this, the buprenorphine produces a significantly reduced opioid reaction (as it should). But the effect of millions of receptors being deprived of their full opioid agonist and instead being replaced by a partial opioid agonist (that, by design, has a weakened effect) can trigger withdrawal symptoms in the person.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/suboxone/precipitated-withdrawal" rel="nofollow">https://americanaddictioncenters.org/suboxone/precipitated-withdrawal
</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
How can this possibly happen if you’re on Suboxone first? The opiate won’t bind to anything as Suboxone got there first, so no withdrawal. The order is critical though.
</p>
<p>
I imagine you’d want to be careful doing this because if you missed a dose of Suboxone you might be in the reverse situation. For surgery purposes presumably you’d be under suitable medical care.

Neither one of those articles listed are peer reviewed, first and foremost.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, perhaps my sentence structure or grammar usage had been a bit misleading. I didn’t mean if the person is actively taking Suboxone and then uses an opioid. I’d been referencing if the OP were to stop utilizing the Suboxone in lieu of the opioids for pain relief and then returned to using them again. In other words, they were using opioids to manage pain whilst healing from surgery and then chose to switch to the Suboxone.

Wow!! You’re one of those “nurses” huh? I’ve been an RN for 25 years, even worked in an addiction center for a while, but I never speak like you do, to anyone, unless I’m 10000% sure. You are the one who needs a little more education on this subject, because you’re 10000% wrong. I know this because of personal experience, and just a little bit of research. Brush up on your research, and maybe curb the ego. I truly hope by now you’re more knowledgeable, and definitely are not telling patients this nonsense.

First off being a nurse or an rn doesn&#39;t mean you know anything about Suboxone or addiction.  Secondly that&#39;s not how you get precip you have it backwards. I actually find it upsetting you claim to be a nurse and don&#39;t know how it works.  The Suboxone rips the other opioids from the receptors because it has a higher affinity but it&#39;s only a partial agonist so those full agonist effects are immediately gone causing precipitated withdrawals.  It unbelievable how widely unknowledgeable most of the medical field is on the subject.

I was just looking for this since a friend on subs is going in for SRS in the US soon and I wasn&#39;t sure what to advise since they&#39;re too embarrassed to ask. Last person I knew with this issue got put on Methadone and stayed there instead. That was a really disgusting bit of medical misinformation. In addition to the absolute insanity of putting someone on Kratom who was self medicating for Anxiety and Depression on 2mg of Bupe?!!!
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s such a strong drug that only fent knocks it from the receptors. If you look at a graph of receptor binding, 8-12mg fills up your receptors by 80%. You can taper Kratom with codeine. I&#39;m guessing this is America because wtaf.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve found Nurses have a real tendency to overstate what they understand. I&#39;m training to be one since the pay is better and I&#39;ve come across Nurses who think vaccines are bad, try to overrule the consultant and pharmacist.
</p>
<p>
I had one nurse argue with me saying it was Ketamine that caused a patients brain damage when their notes stated multiple times that it was damage from hitting their head during uncontrolled seizures. So they were denying the person with CANCER pain medication by &#34;being busy&#34;, told me to do the same and I had to report them. I&#39;m sorry but addiction isn&#39;t a valid reason to torture someone.
</p>
<p>
I worked in an addiction clinic and you have no idea how much I want to choke judgemental assholes. So many people came close to death because they had previously sought help and had encountered so much ignorance.

Just to add you have to take a rather large amount of fent to overcome the bupe.  A larger than normal dose.  I hate to admit it but I know about precip because I&#39;ve been through it and have taken opioids while on bupe and have broken through.  Precip is caused by a very specific thing.  It&#39;s sad but i&#39;m more versed and experienced than most medical professionals on the subject.  You&#39;d be surprised how unknowledgeable even some of the addiction specialists in clinics are on the subject.

Oh, I know but it&#39;s definitely possible to do was more my point. I made sure I spent time online where addicts talked because I wanted to deepen my understanding. I listened to them as well and I didn&#39;t just roll my eyes, I grew up with an addict. My childhood best friend was one. It&#39;s hard to put the genie back in the bottle and the reasons are as varied as snowflakes for it.

<p>
You&#39;re right about the specialist issue. Honestly the whole medical profession, as well as counseling/AA groups etc are often plain wrong. Sure, addicts can be very wrong too but that doesn&#39;t mean others are automatically right. Like, the amount of medical professionals who believe it every time a new non-addictive opiate is advertised is shocking. Heroin was meant to be non addictive, then Oxycodone was non addictive etc.
</p>
<p>
Or the current big one in my country right now is pregabalin. My pharmacist genuinely said that it wasn&#39;t addictive and had no withdrawal, yet you can find loads of testimony and I&#39;ll eat my foot when a non addictive GABA or opiate drug comes out.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, I hope that you&#39;re safe and stay safe. God forbid someone who is meant to listen to patients maybe listens to an outside voice.

Many people become massively dependent on Suboxone.   It causes severe withdrawal symptoms, mainly depression &amp; anxiety.   You can’t just stop with “minimal symptoms”.
</p>
<p>
I’ve withdrawn twice from it in my life and both times I had wicked anxiety, sleeplessness, and chills, gooseflesh, runny nose, etc.
</p>
<p>
You can take suboxone and still have this surgery, you just need to be at the lowest possible dose and stop taking it about 72 hrs before surgery.   You will be encountering withdrawals by the time you have surgery but then the pain meds will take over.

I’m well aware of the physical dependence someone can ascertain being on suboxone; when I referenced “minimal symptoms” it was directed towards OP’s use Kratom, not suboxone.
</p>
<p>
Also who would recommend someone stop taking suboxone 72 hours before surgery? As I, and someone else mentioned, it should be gradually tapered down or switched to an alternative medication such as methodone until OP is post-op and capable of resuming her PCP’s prior care plan.

The pain management people will just push you beyond the threshold of where suboxone coverage ends and opioids begin.  If you are already in somewhat of withdrawal it won’t be difficult to feel the effects of opioids.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn’t recommend going into surgery on a high dose but they said they were at 2mg which is a very low dose.   I’m currently on 10 and it’s considered low.

●Patients who take buprenorphine •For patients who take buprenorphine for either OUD or chronic pain, we suggest continuing buprenorphine during an episode of acute pain (Grade 2C), and we continue the patient&#39;s home dose. (See &#39;Whether to continue buprenorphine during pain management&#39; above and &#39;Continue buprenorphine&#39; above.) •If opioids are required for mild acute pain in patients who take buprenorphine, after maximizing nonopioid analgesic strategies, the dose of buprenorphine can be increased up to 32 mg per day, divided into doses every six to eight hours. For moderate to severe pain, other opioids can be added to the regimen, similar to patients on methadone. (See &#39;Add supplementary opioids for severe or undertreated pain&#39; above.) •Dose conversions between buprenorphine and other opioids are problematic. Thus, for patients on buprenorphine who require oral opioids for initial pain control, we start with empiric doses of short-acting oral opioids at doses higher than would be used for opioid naïve patients (eg, oxycodone 20 to 30 mg orally), with dose titration every four hours based on pain control. More rapid titration of IV opioids is appropriate for more severe pain. (See &#39;Add supplementary opioids for severe or undertreated pain&#39; above.)

TLDR: it should be fine to stay on 2mg bupe/day and get short acting opioids on top, probably not worth the discomfort of trying to go through withdrawal
</p>
<p>
The old recommendation used to be for folks to get off bupe prior to needing opioids for pain, but obviously that sucks to go through the withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
The more modern recommendation is to just continue the bupe and dose with opioids on top. They won’t make you feel euphoric in the same way, but it does seem that the painkilling effect is still effective
</p>
<p>
The other important point in your case is the 2mg, as you mentioned, is quite a low dose. That means that most of your opioid receptors and your opioid system is still available, so your body should react quite similarly to someone not on bupe. Receptor saturation doesn’t really cap out until much higher doses like 12-16mg
</p>
<p>
As other folks I believe have mentioned too, bupe itself can be a painkiller, so that’s always an option as well, but is not usually the first recommendation in acute post surgical pain

Yeah, staying on the same dose once you’re used to it won’t make a huge difference in acute pain since your body adapts

I just tapered off my suboxone for my breast augmentation and now I&#39;m back on. It went perfectly!
</p>
<p>
I had to do the same thing for my nose job.
</p>
<p>
Basically the doctor should give you oxycodone or viccodin pre op. So about 72-96 hours before surgery, you stop your suboxone.
</p>
<p>
Once you feel withdrawal, you can start taking your oxycodone. (I take 4 MG suboxone daily, so I was taking about 30mg oxycodone split into 10mg for day and 20mg for night). When I went in for surgery I wasn&#39;t dopesick but I had mild withdrawal symptoms.
</p>
<p>
The pain meds they gave me for surgery were versed (generic fentanyl). If you&#39;re like me and a former junkie, you might know that fentanyl will usually overtake suboxone. And you could even take suboxone and get high on fent within like 4-6 hours later.
</p>
<p>
So just listen to your doctor. About 72-96 hours before surgery stop suboxone, switch to your post op pain meds and then dose just enough to not get sick.
</p>
<p>
Upon recovering from your surgery, take the remaining of your pain meds and it&#39;s very important you wait until you&#39;re in mild withdrawal before you dose your suboxone.
</p>
<p>
When dosing your suboxone to prevent precipitated withdrawal: split a pill in half, and then break off a tiny crumb of that half. It should be like 1/100th of a pill and dose that, wait a half hour, take like 1/20 of a pill wait a half hour at this point you&#39;re probably ok to go ahead and try 1/4 to 1/2 your medicine. From there you should be all set
</p>
<p>
Also, in my opinion suboxone makes much better post op pain meds than oxycodone or hydrocodone. But you definitely can&#39;t take suboxone with other opiates.

But suboxone never helped me with pain? I mean I just got stung by a bee and clawed by a cat I felt that pain and it still hurts a lot. I don&#39;t know how people get pain relief from this?

<p>
​

I will talk to the surgeons but I cant see a doctor willingly give me oxycodone since its such high potential for abuse?

I’m about to have a tonsillectomy on the 5th. I take 3/4th of 2mg suboxone a day.  I have Percocet 5 mg at home and prescribed oxycodone 5 mg 1 or 2 for pain after surgery. I plan to stop the sub and go to Percocet before surgery let my body adjust and continue post op with the oxycodone 5mg they prescribed.  I take my suboxone up to 3 times a day because it just works for me. I took my 3rd last strip yesterday at 3pm.    Should I start the Percocet transfer ? It’s 11:19. Few hours will be 24 hrs since last sub dose.

I am having a total knee replacement next week. My pain doc and my surgeon say the protocol has changed.
</p>
<p>
Past surgeries I’ve tapered off 4-5 days prior and replaced with short acting opiates.  Post surgery higher doses of oxycodone worked well.  Never had a problem resuming buprenorphrine after.
</p>
<p>
Now they are both telling me to stay on my 12mg dose and not taper.  They say to add oxycodone to the buprenorphrine and that I will be fine.
</p>
<p>
I’m so scared.  My last TKR I tapered off before, ised short acting opiates for 3-4 days, and took 20mg oxycodone every 4 hours for 2 weeks.  Then resumed buprenorphrine.
</p>
<p>
They told me it’s my choice.  I’ve been on buprenorphrine for 20 years.  I’ve had three surgeries doing the taper and one without.  The one where I stayed on Bup was awful.   My TKR will have a nerve block for 24 hours or so.
</p>
<p>
I’m thinking of stopping or lowering to 4mg.
</p>
<p>
Who’s had surgery and not tapered?  How’d it work?  What would you do?

I had surgery and just tapered down a little the day before surgery as prescribed by my Dr.I had a block in recovery and that was a godsend.I was on a low dose ketamine drip for a few days and oxycodone.After the ketamine was stopped and it was just oxycodone they didn&#39;t give me enough and no one really managed the Suboxone dosing very well.Oxycodone 10mg barely touched my pIn

Easy!   Ask your Doctor to switch you to Subutex for your surgery.  It&#39;s the only option that makes sense.  You&#39;ll be able to use painkillers safely
</p>
<p>
Back in the fall. I had a nasty cyst that became infected and I developed sepsis.  Because I used to be in Healthcare and am currently on suboxone I decided that I fought want the inevitable judgemental bullshit at the ER, so I tried to treat it as home.  That was extremely stupid because I got so sick I started to develop kidney failure.   My BF had to carry me, bodily. to the ER.   Since I a so sick I didn&#39;t feel the usual stigma about being on MAT
<br>
Anyways, I was in a lot of pain and I couldn&#39;t have the surgery to remove the cyst until I stabilized.  So what they did was switch me to Subutex fit the duration of my stay.  That way I could get other opiates and they would be effective.  For those who don&#39;t know Subutex is just buprenorphine without the naloxone.
</p>
<p>
And it worked quite well.  They weren&#39;t stingy on the narcotics either.  I was really worried that I would have to go without anything for pain, but my Doctor actually used his head and switched me to Subutex.  I know I&#39;m late to the party here,  but if you have upcoming surgery please talk to your doctor about switching to Subutex for post surgical pain.
<br>
I was on it for almost a month,  in the hospital and at home.  When It was time to stop taking painkillers, I was really scared I would feel withdrawal symptoms but I didn&#39;t.   And I wasn&#39;t tempted to cheat and use illicit opiates either.   I was proud of myself for that.
<br>
I really encourage that you talk to your Dr and ask about Subutex. It really is the only answer.  I don&#39;t think tapering off subs just for surgery is necessary.

Hopefully you see this but Im on subutex now after surgery and have pain killers. Did you take the subutex with the painkillers at the same time? And was you ok?
</p>
<p>
Im too afraid for stop just to take the painkiller but im in alot of pain and my dr who prescribed me painkillers knows im on subutex but I didnt get a chance to ask if I can take it together since I was on anesthesia

Sorry this is so late.  I took the subutex with the Oxy.  That way I wouldn&#39;t have any withdrawal when I ran out of oxy.  It was fine, I had no problems.

ive had to do (tonsillectomy) before and it was bad! i have a nose job coming up and also will be staying on bup with nothing but Tylenol and iboprofin. im scared and anxious! but i will deal with it when i get there. let me just say this doctors always think that bup is good for pain but im telling its not! for somebody who has been on bup for even a 3-4 months bup doesnt do anything but block opiate receptors its essentially a long acting naloxone. it would be great if doctors would put mat patients on short acting opiates on top of a small dose of bup. but most doctors wont do that. imho i think doctors (if patient wants to) should have the patient taper down to 1mg every day a couple of weeks before surgery and prescribe short acting opiates on top of the bup. this will not only help pain much better than bup alone but it would also take ALL of the euphoria from the narcotic while still allowing better pain relief then anything bup could ever do. bup has no pain relieving effects on opiate dependent patients. fyi your could use kratom if doctors dont prescribe full agonist and from first hand experience you will get pretty good relief. kratom 100% works while patients are on low doses of bup. idk why bup doesnt block or prevent kratoms effects. i know this because last time i was in so much pain the first 2 days after surgery i just wanted to get something, i was seriously debating getting dope but thankfully i researched and found out about kratom. didnt think it would help at all but it worked 1000x better than just bup.

I was on subs for 7 years for pain instead of opiates.I had 1 wrist surgery I woke up during.  Then had carpal tunnel surgery I had only been on 1mg &gt; 6 months ​at time of.  After surgery I was given 10-5mg oxy. Needless to say the pain was fing excruciating. I felt everything.. Both Drs knew before  surgery. They didn&#39;t even suggest stopping an switching to opiotes before which is the only thing that semi works. You can not just stop cold a week out.  Im now thru 28 days of withdrawals to get off. I would say you need at least 6-12months to be clean. Narcan metabolites can be found in urine up to a year after stopping. This drug is horrible due to the half life. My biggest fear is something happening were I need emergency care an nothing will work on me. I do need surgery but I refuse  now. A minor surgery, that much pain, no way am I putting another rod in my back w/o drugs working afterwards. Hope telling my story helps

If I just started mat treatment and still feels the detox but have a surgery where I need pain killers is it safe to continue to take the subutex right after? Since it will still be in my system?

I would 100% have quit suboxone, gone through FULL recovery and withdrawal and then made the decision regarding surgery.
</p>
<p>
Sub can easily be influencing this life changing decision.

I was given Oxy and Tramadol in Montreal.  I think it was a ten day supply of each.  I switched to T1 a few days later because I didn&#39;t like how the stronger opioids were making me feel.  The nurses were great about explaining pain management and very helpful.  There are painkillers for people who are opioid resistant but I don&#39;t know what they are.

<p>
You are given a timeline of when you need to stop HRT, alcohol, smoking and other things prior to your surgery.  You should confirm with them about whether you need to stop the Suboxone.

Suboxone itself can mediate pain, and is beginning to be used for recovering addicts in moderate to severe pain.
<a href="https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article-abstract/120/5/1262/13748" rel="nofollow">Suboxone for Pain Management
</a>
you can find many such articles using Google Scholar.
</p>
<p>
You should probably have a conversation with your anesthesiologist and surgeon about the plan for your surgery, but unless they don&#39;t know their profession very well there&#39;s likely little risk of improper treatment.

I went to one for glucocorticoid addiction in Mexico about 10 years ago. Down in Rosarito, just south of San Diego / Tijuana. I think it cost $4000 for 6 days&#39; stay, food, doctor checkup, and treatment, all in a nice beachside clinic.
</p>
<p>
How much is it in Canada?
