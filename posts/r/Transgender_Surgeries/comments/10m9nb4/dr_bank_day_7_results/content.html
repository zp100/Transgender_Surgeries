You‚Äôre looking at $25k or just under for surgery, flight, hotel and food. I went with my BFF and stayed in the hospital with her. It was $50 for the week with food. We had dinner at a good restaurant and it was $12 for both of us. If it were me, I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else but the Suporn clinic.

I read
<a href="https://ibb.co/8bLzjRy" rel="nofollow">this</a>
about Suporn. I hope Dr. Banks is better.

No doctor is without an unhappy patient, even the best. My BFF who is 4‚Äô11‚Äù and 93lbs had hers in 2010, pretty much no complications except after her revision her husband at the time was too girthy and it hurt, he was far from small so cis girls would also struggle. I can‚Äôt see the scars under magnification, looks completely cis and her gyno didn‚Äôt know until she was in the middle of an exam and asked why she had no cervix. She doesn‚Äôt dilate and hasn‚Äôt for some years

No offense, but you must of just rolled in on off the Oregon trail. Dr. Supporn may be the single best surgeon for vaginoplasty since 2005. At this point there really isn&#39;t anything anyone could say about his dedication to trans-bottom surgery that would take away from his reputation.

I‚Äôve met both he and his wife. They were both lovely and his wife thought I was there for my surgery (I‚Äôm cis and not masc at all) and my BFF was tickled. The hospital kept giving me the paper work when they saw us. I don‚Äôt mind and it was really affirming for her. The whole experience was nice but I‚Äôm glad I stayed with her in the hospital because she needed help eating and they didn‚Äôt have warmers after surgery and she was freezing, they also kept moving her button so she couldn‚Äôt reach it. I think I paid $50 for a bed and meals for the week, the food was actually really good.

I can&#39;t wait for the day when I get my bottom surgery. Should I really have Dr. Supporn do my bottom surgery or Dr Banks? I don&#39;t know which is better?
</p>
<p>
Also congratulations on the surgery! She&#39;ll need some rest though. It looks amazing already

You have lovely results already!!!! My consultation is a month away, and I am on the waiting list. Probably 2024 late.
</p>
<p>
I am worried about pubic hair. I was told they remove the layer of hair folicals, so that is never an issue.
</p>
<p>
Have found that to be the case? Do they remove hair they know will be an issue??

One of the things I love the most about this surgeon is how consistent he is with his work üòç. Congrats on your surgery. Wish you a speedy recovery, girl.

Did you ask Dr. Bank for a specific aesthetic for your vulva?

I&#39;m looking to get surgery with
<a href="https://Dr.Bank" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bank</a>
as well. Where you able to have a discussion with him about what you wanted your results to look like or is it more of a one size fits all?
