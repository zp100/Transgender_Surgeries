I am 29 and 2.5 years on hormones. Put in order I had the operations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<em>
FFS
</em>
Easily the most painful and socially disruptive surgery I had. There are a lot of nerve endings in the face, the swelling made it hard to eat, it was so hard to leave the house because I was wrapped up like a bloody mess. Incisions in the mouth made eating hard, breathing was hard, talking was hard. I had it in the summer and sweated like a grilled hot dog under my dressings. Probably the most impactful surgery I had on my ability to pass. I felt awkward the first month because of how drastic the change was, especially around close friends. I worried that people thought it was cosmetic and would judge me despite insurance finding it medically necessary. I look at old pictures and gosh, even when I thought I passed, I absolutely didn&#39;t without FFS. I went to Dr. Deschamps Braly in SF
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>
Top Surgery
</em>
Probably third most painful, mostly because I had capsular contracture on my right side. Picking things up hurt for a long while. Socially it is weird to show up with boobs one day but many people didn&#39;t notice. Plus trans people are changing all the time. I had 440CC and they are awesome. I have an alternative account where I post topless pics on reddit for karma and validation and no one can tell I am trans or that these are fake. I love having tits! I went to Dr. Berli at OHSU
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>
Voice Surgery
</em>
Right up there with FFS - so important for passing. Pain was minimal, but not talking for 3 weeks was kind of difficult. Difficult socially the most. Pain pretty much gone in a week. Probably the least painful procedure besides my top surgery revision, which was obviously the smallest procedure. It hurt to cough and was hard to explain (while stealth... i prefer the term blending in) because everyone notices the scar for the first month and also you arent talking. If you trained your voice before many people wont notice you sound different at all. I saw Dr Thomas in Portland
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>
Hair Transplants
</em>
These hurt a little more than I expected, and it is awkward having a greasy bloody hairline for weeks. The operation went fast and results look great a few months after. It will make a big difference in how my hairline looks, I have pretty wicked widows peak and V shape from recession. Although part of my FFS lowered my hairline it still looks mechanical (from incision) and male. Most of the pain was social awkwardness. I saw Dr Gabel in Portland.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>
Top Surgery Revision
</em>
The painful capsular contracture was revised and fixed. Minimal pain. Missed less than a week of work. Was back to normal in no time. Again, Dr. Berli at OHSU
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>
GRS
</em>
I had minimal depth and the nurse assistant and my partner says it looks amazing. Since I have no dilation (just vulva, clit, labia, all the good stuff) the pain is so minimal. I can&#39;t imagine dilation. The most pain was from constipation and having a catheter while in the hospital. I had the catheter out for a short period and felt amazing, but it was re-inserted I was sent home with it because my pee stream was still weak and they worried about it. I am home with a catheter for the next week before it is removed. Again the catheter and constipation are the most painful parts. I know when I have the both removed I will feel fantastic. Hurts less than FFS, more than voice surgery. I was hospitalized for 3 days for this. Probably 2nd most painful one. Socially no one will really know i had it so I dont talk about it much because I dont have to explain anything. I saw Dr. Dugi in Portland.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The next surgery I am having is fat transfer to hips and butt in January then I am done with medical stuff
</p>
<p>
All have been covered by insurance. Also because I get this a lot, try not to bother focusing on my insurance, unless you are one of 1500 employees that are graduate students at a specific university, it will not work for ya. If you are looking at grad school choices based on insurance, PM me!
</p>
<p>
edit - my 2013 ankle surgery hurt more than any of these, just FYI, so that is the most painful medical thing I have had ever for comparison.

I also went to OHSU for top surgery (FTM top surgery) and had a good experience there.

I found the recovery for FFS pretty easy to be honest, but I have nothing to compare it to because it&#39;s the first surgery I&#39;ve had (SRS in a few months!). I had surgery with Facial Team though so my experience could have been different.
</p>
<p>
It was very hard to eat for the first week, and then I just had to be kind of careful about eating after that because of the stitches in my mouth. Sleeping was uncomfortable for the first few weeks because I had to sleep on my back with my head elevated, which is a position I&#39;m not used to as I usually sleep on my side with only one pillow. I never experienced much pain at all.

I had an ankle surgery in 2013 that hurt more than any of these gender affirming surgeries. But still, FFS hurt more than GRS for me, and those two surgeries more than the other small procedures (which were less than 2 hour surgeries). I think it is also different based on what you have done, and the conditions you recovered in. I had quite a bit done and my face was wrapped up like a mummy, and having a forehead cast + cut in my mouth + big surgical wrappings + nose stint was super uncomfortable. Perhaps uncomfortable is more accurate than pain. I would say Dr. DB is a world class doctor and almost all my discomfort/pain was due to my moving around and sleeping and eating situations. It was not his fault I had pain/discomfort.
</p>
<p>
If I could wave a magic wand, I would have stayed 2 blocks away at most. EDIT - my stay was 2.5 hours away in the hot california sun driving around in traffic and such. I am a student trying to save money, god that part sucked.
</p>
<p>
Did top surgery or GRS hurt/discomfort you more? Sleeping on my back was new to me too on all of these procedures. Probably the most uncomfortable part of all of them!

Hey fellow Sydneysider. Haha sorry I did a quick stalk because your name seemed familiar. I was looking for what surgeries you had? I scanned the rhinoplasty document Facial Team published but wasn&#39;t really able to understand the medical lingo. Is the incision inside your mouth for the rhinoplasty? I&#39;m getting forehead, nose and adams apple done next month. Can&#39;t wait! But I also like to eat very much lmao

I have a consult with Dugi in January. Any and all info you can provide on your experience would be much appreciated. There is virtually no trace of his work on the internet.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been to the class on vaginoplasty offered by OHSU on the procedure and I’m somewhat active with the community here in Portland who say nothing but the best about him, but other than that there is absolutely no trace.

I also commented on that post, but thank you for taking the time to throw that suggestion my way. I question those limited sources, however, because the city of Portland/those with direct experience have nothing but amazing things to say to say about him, so much so that that his wait time for consult is almost three years at this point. That said, ultimately everyone’s experience is their own and of course a lot of variables go into this stuff. Both good and bad perspectives need to be shared. I just wish there was more in general either way, because there is virtually nothing.

The (only) good thing about 3 years wait list is that there should be more info about him by then. Hopefully even some photo&#39;s. If you know anyone who&#39;s had surgery with him perhaps they will show you in person?

a plan that is hyper specific to my graduate employmentship at a PNW university (2000 student employees are the only ones on this plan) through pacific source. do not expect any plan through them to give you these benefits unless you are a graduate employee at our university, because we specifically have this added to our small plan. we fought for it on our plan and if you fight with your employer they might be able to get you a plan that has it too!

I didn&#39;t know grs with minimal depth so no dilation needed was a thing. Can you tell me more about this? I&#39;m super curious because that is the biggest hangups I have about grs I&#39;d thr lifetime dilating afterwards when I dont even mind not having depth because I&#39;m super into girls and dont care about penetration. Any sexual partner I have in future I would be open with about my trans identity before being sexual with them so I think this is what I&#39;d want to do for myself

imagine that the &#39;vaginal canal&#39; only goes like 1 to 2 inches in. It does not need to surgically pierce through the pelvic muscles, be adhered to the other side, or have a skin graft. Healing is near painless, much much lower risk of complications or revisions, and no dilation because no hole to maintain for the rest of your life. I think it may be something great for you. I didnt want penetration - and if i do I have a prostate, a gift most women do not have. Dilation sounds so painful and awful. So does worrying about infection, closing up, and complications of a surgical canal the rest of my life. Thus, minimal depth / no depth! everything else is created - labia, clit, vulva. looks amazing.  the biggest downside is that if I ever wanted a penis or dildo into a vagina I do not have a vagina that can do that. Literally the only thing I can think of. Electrolysis is basically not needed unless for aesthetic (which I did). the main reason ppl need electrolysis is so that you dont have hairs growing inside 5+ inches deep in your body the rest of your life (ouch)

im looking forward to getting this variation of SRS with Dr. Chettawut in 7 weeks! i started my transition at 19 and am now 36 and FINALLY getting SRS! all those years i didnt want to dilate, or worry about having a surgically created canal inside me that could become infected or hairy, and now finally i can get the operation that i always wanted, and aesthetic one, that functions, but not for penetration. all SRS doctors should offer this as a viable option. especially since there has been a LOT of interest in it generating over the last few years!

Thanks for sharing, I&#39;m interested in knowing what food you found easiest/most difficult to eat after FFS?

I was under the impression that Deschamps-Braly didn&#39;t accept insurance. Has that changed, or was there special circumstances?

I had special circumstances where I basically gave my receipts to my insurance and insurance reimbursed me directly. Dr DB only gave me the receipt, thats all I needed. You are still correct.

I think that’s what normally happens with him: I remember reading someone’s post saying DB was going to do a trial of accepting insurance and I wasn’t sure if that’s what happened with you. Thanks for the info!

I look at this list and I look at what&#39;s available to me in the UK (option 6, after between a likely 3 and 5 year wait) without charge and honestly it&#39;s devastating.
</p>
<p>
Well done for going through all those surgeries though. Sounds brutal x

oh darn! Can I ask why you like high profile over low profile? Berli told me that low profile was better on broader rib cages. I also did under the muscle as well. I am glad this helps for you!

Hi, I have a couple questions about your hair transplant.
</p>
<p>
How many grafts did you need? Did you have FUT or FUE?
</p>
<p>
Lastly, do you notice the loss in density from the donor area on the back of the head? Like does your hair feel and look dramatically thinner in the back or is it little different from before?

I cant remember the exact number, maybe like 1800 grafts? I did the strip method. The back of my head is just fine and I don&#39;t have any complaints about that!
