He refused to do PPT on me because he said he only does it for the “initial” srs surgeries not for revisions

Same experience with Belinky in Argentina! Maybe good surgeon but ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PERSON.
</p>
<p>
What you described is the typical devaluating, mistreating, and gaslighting of a narcissist.
</p>
<p>
Specialized surgeons are usually jerks and feel like a &#34;god&#34;, and the worst are the ones tied with Psychiatry or with &#34;gender psychiatrists&#34; because the mix between Freudian ideology and the grandiose ego of such a surgeon makes a inhuman combo.
</p>
<p>
Belinky and part of his team and friend colleagues (like DiMaggio) are absolutely evil people (one young guy was kind but, he&#39;s on the doctor&#39;s side...) and I&#39;m believing they can (for... Reasons) botch your body  purposedly but to extent to not get sued. Smart moves to recommend you do things that will make recovery worse, and &#34;anyway it was your decision, i never told you to do that&#34; kind of patient-doctor relationship.
</p>
<p>
They know how to lead you to unhealthy outcomes but not in a way that will make them accountable.
</p>
<p>
They&#39;ll blame it to &#34;your fucked up mind&#34; as those exacts words that dr Belinky said to me many times in the 5 first days on the clinic.
</p>
<p>
Fucking asshole he tried to hide a deep sharp pain (momentary nerve injury, cervicobrachialgia) in my shoulder that leave me insomniac for almost 3 days, never ever gave me help with sleeping, and he said &#34;it&#39;s your head that makes your pain, I won&#39;t say the pain didn&#39;t exists, but it IS IN YOUR HEAD&#34; then tried to make me take antipsychotics FFS, to try 2nd time to make me shut my mouth of 3 days in a row screaming to the staff &#34;please help me with this pain I CAN&#39;T SLEEP!&#34; They treated me like a psychotic patient all the time. The nurses were all by his side even they aren&#39;t from his team, just the clinic staff. But they covered his dirty ass.
</p>
<p>
Then after blaming for &#34;creating the pain&#34; he gaslighted me every day saying &#34;you fucked up all your recovery, you&#39;ll got open wounds now, they&#39;ll become infected, you&#39;ll loose all the surgery work, many bad things will happen ok?&#34;
</p>
<p>
He sounded like, not a possibility but eventually will happen for real. And they happened step by step. Then blamed me. Again.
</p>
<p>
But....he never held accountable for the agression I received from day 2 when I asked for alleviation of my shoulder! They NEVER HELPED ME, instead...started a dirty psychological devaluation that put me in STRESS SHOCK, then I started to feel bad, really bad and they do started to say &#34;are you OK?  No you are not ok, you seem to have something bad in your head, right? Yes there&#39;s something bad in your head&#34;... All with a dark smile and scary tone...
</p>
<p>
(All this was provoked me to enter a state of vigilance because I never expected of being psychologically attacked by health personnel)
</p>
<p>
So basically they covered up their responsibility for my shoulder pain, covered up some complication in the rectum, all while doing this dirty gaslighting to provoke me to enter on a SHOCK emotional state ... a state that they used TO BLAME TO ME!  This is classic narcissistic BLAMESHIFT abusive behavior.
</p>
<p>
What a sickfucks! He should stop talking too much white stuff and start to be a human being! The day 5 1st dilation he was HIGH AS F. Throwed the kit in bed like if it were garbage. His mood was dirty, aggressive, psycho, and constantly devaluating. This put me in STRESS AGAIN  and it took me several days in the hotel to recover in away. Then he continued the GASLIGHT through WhatsApp and phone calls. He&#39;s really a psychopath.
</p>
<p>
(Other ex patient told me the same about he getting high! So it&#39;s not my ideation, he really changed mood in the same pattern as the sniffers. You can put a car in your nose no problem, but this doesn&#39;t allow you to be abusive with your patients you sickfucks and cowards, because you do it only WHEN HIGH)
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re a vulnerable human being when in the OR and while you&#39;re trans, but there are horrendous people there aimed to put you on stress, you feel very very, then they blame it to your &#34;mental health&#34; they themselves created!
</p>
<p>
Classic psychopath behavior and this happens not only in health system, but it shouldn&#39;t be! You go to the OR to expect leaving in your best state, not worst!
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t went to get SRS to be devaluated and pushed, and abandoned in the hotel. I TRUSTED MY SURGEON LIKE NEVER. I were mindfucked by him and then he blamed for the stress he &amp; team provoked on me.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re from another country and bring USD DOLLARS in the hand you&#39;ll be treated like the Queen of Windsor. This way they evade paying taxes to the State.
</p>
<p>
If your a local and bring local Peso (ARS) and with no accompaniment you&#39;ll be mistreated, pushed, pissedof, attacked, gaslighted and abandoned.
</p>
<p>
Just warning locals of DiMaggio and Belinky. Horrible persons both.

You should make a whole new post and address this, otherwise your testimony might just get lost in here. It is important that others know of this so they avoid him and prevent further horrible experiences

Thank you :(
</p>
<p>
If i could know.... Maybe a scholiosis had to do. Not my fault.
</p>
<p>
Seems to be they moved me in a rude way to the bed before entering my room. Other ppl told me sometimes doctors manage your body in non ethical ways and you end up with injuries. A soft moving into the bed with wheel, going to your room, that moment is when they decide to grab you from the arms stretching your cervical articulations and they fuck up.
</p>
<p>
The shoulder is oversensitive due to playing tennis in my childhood, then playing guitars for 30 years, computer, etc... But what they didn&#39;t assisted me was, with the pain after, it marked the difference between a good and a horrible recovery.

If I could know.... maybe, it seems when moved from the OR to the bed with wheels, they moved my body in a way that dislocated some cervical/shoulder junctions, and then it flared up 6 hrs later. Some local young nurse told me that doctors sometimes do that, and it&#39;s not good, as it happened to her 2 years ago...
</p>
<p>
had the same pain with orchidectomy in 2019, same shoulder, same time (hrs later...). It could be an issue of &#39;&#39;transportation&#39;&#39; in the OR. Some mismanagement. Drs do things that are unethical, sometimes minor, sometimes hurtful ones.

pain management after the opioid epidemy is difficult, they wont prescribe painkillers unless it for palliative care or even then they wont. my girlfriend had an absecc in her face removed and all they gave her was ibuprofen. is very common now. and they didnt prescribe you antipsychotics bc they deemed you psychotic, antipsychotics are commonly used to induce sleep. is something that is discussed and not all doctors agree but is widely used for that  in small doses. they couldve given you benzos but maybe there was a reason for that.
</p>
<p>
im telling you this not to unvalidate your experience but to help you make a bit more sense of this. what you lived thru is horrible and i agree, most doctors are abusers who enjoy toying with peoples bodies. specially trans bodies, more so when they are &#34;specialists on trans issues&#34; and make a career out of it like Belinky or DiMaggio. again im so sorry hr put you throu that.

I’m not gonna publicly say his name just because he’s willing to fix it for me and my main problem was not having enough skin for depth. All dr ting did was basically cut and stretch back open and left it like that and didn’t bother to see me after he makes his assistants treat post op patients so he doesn’t have to deal and face his mistakes. He refused to do PPT on me which I stated would be the only way to fix the problem. Also his facial work isn’t good I regret going to him for that as well I actually look worse than pre op… I’m still passable as before but one of my eyes is sucken in…. Dr ting wasn’t patient enough to hear my thoughts because he’s a narcissist so it lead to him failing… also I’ve spoken to other trans women in his waiting room who were botched as well

Jess Ting doesn&#39;t even do FFS.  That was a huge mistake going to him for that.  Dr Harrison Lee is the big name for that in USA.  I do know some other doctors are going after that now because it&#39;s big money. I figure Lee could fix your FFS and the big names in vagioplasty are Ting and Bowers so maybe Marci can tell you what she thinks?  I believe she moved back to California.

When I did my research on getting a zero depth and talked to Jess, he was only doing vaginal work.   That was maybe 4 years ago?  Hopefully Marci Bowers and Harrison Lee can get you back on track with your transition?   I did 9 FFS procedures but I&#39;m kind of pondering a trachea shave now that I decided against VFSRAC.  Did you do trachea?

Is that the female surgeon? Because he has a female surgeon there as well I just forgot her name but I even had a consultation with her too and she said there’s nothing she can do to help me and gave me the number to NYU Langone but I’m not going to nyu because there waiting list is like 2-3 years it’s ridiculous
