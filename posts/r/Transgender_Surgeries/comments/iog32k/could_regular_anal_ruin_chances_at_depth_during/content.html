So I saw a post that regular anal could limit vaginal depth during srs, that kind has me worried, since, well that&#39;s how I tend to enjoy sex. So I&#39;m just worried that I could ruin my chances when having srs down the line - which is something I very much intend to have. Sorry if this is a gross or nsfw topic, I just kind of want to know.

I remember a girl’s fiancé posted on here about a year ago saying that a Thai surgeon (Chet iirc) cancelled their srs the day before surgery. The girl had a history of using large anal toys that somehow made srs not viable? Their fiancé wrote a very long post on here about it and how the girl was suicidal and it was breaking their heart and there was obvious frustration with the surgeon/surgeon’s office for not warning them of this being a barrier.
</p>
<p>
I’ve used some bigger than average toys in the past and it worried me that something like this could happen to me. I really hope it was just that one office being weird.
</p>
<p>
Sucks for that girl and their fiancé😢, I can’t even imagine what that must have been like.

Yeah... that post is kinda what freaked me out initially. I&#39;ve used some fairly large toys already, and i&#39;ve had a colonoscopy for unrelated issues so I was super super worried.

Chett has blamed anal sex for lack of depth many times, but I’ve not heard it so much in the last few years.

I’ve been out since 2000 and that one instance was the only case I ever heard, but it did scare me.  Still when you think of it, most mtf have at least experimented with anal sex.   So it would seem to be a routine problem if actually true.

I saw a post here about that. That she went to chet and then woke up from her surgery to a zero depth. And was heartbroken and suicidal because she was straight and wanted to have sex with her bf that way. It kinda scared me and makes me remember that in the back of my head all the time. It worries me when I have anal sex now.

Do other surgeons care about it? Also does anal leave scarring inside?

No, this is just a made up reason that Chet told someone to excuse his fuck up, a thing he often does apparently

Possibly. Thanks for mentioning though. I&#39;m just worried it carries over to other surgeons.

What happens? Is it because lack of dilation or this what you got after the srs ?

So this is the post about chett everyone is referring to :
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/cegbvc/unsuccessful_surgery_by_chettawut/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/cegbvc/unsuccessful_surgery_by_chettawut/
</a>
</p>
<p>
I think this is a special case and maybe a Chettuwat thing. As long as you’re gentle and know your limits I think you should be fine.
</p>
<p>
Additionally there have been reports of women with abdominal adhesions ending up with less depth (3-4 inches) but from what I’ve seen this is also from Chettuwat. Here’s an article on adhesions it looks like they’re mostly associated with abdominal surgery and not anal sex.

I don’t think so because they go up your butt, adhesions seem to be highly associated  with open surgery of the abdomen.

I&#39;ll go out on a limb here and say that it might even help due to the peritoneal muscles being stretched. Dilation theroritically could then be even easier however I have no evidence one way or the other to confirm. Interesting question.

Yes, Chett has this, with anal sex there is a frequent flow of blood to the intestine, and it increases in size, and therefore there is no place left to form the vagina.
</p>
<p>
Do not forget about the difference in the structure of pelvic bones.

Personal anecdotes are not fact. Everyone is different, and imho? This sounds like made up hooey, used by people to scare transgender people into not doing something that will help them become who they really are. This is backed up by the fact that you have little to no interactions with this community aside from this instance where you&#39;re trying to scare and obviously already worried person.
