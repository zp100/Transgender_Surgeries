If it makes you feel any better, most guys are around 5 inches anyway. You&#39;d probably just end up making them feel big over anything.

I wouldn’t consider 4 inches to be a failed srs.

I have about six inches if there&#39;s foreplay and I&#39;m relaxed and that&#39;s as deep as my cis friend who had a hysterectomy and also just has a pocket. As was said, average penis length is 5 inches so you are perfectly normal ☺️

Perhaps you should further consider what, if anything, a
<em>
normal sex life
</em>
is
<strong>
to you
</strong>
, and if you want the most useful answer, perhaps you might [edit] and ennumerate the partner(s) you envision, so that those with similar results and aspirations might comment.
</p>
<p>
For example, I&#39;m a transbian with a consistent, single post-op partner, and I haven&#39;t ever had any interest in
<em>
size
</em>
or
<em>
length.
</em>
My partner doesn&#39;t
<em>
have
</em>
anything to penetrate me with, and if we want to get into that, we&#39;re going to get something of suitable size, whatever depth I end up with someday.  Neither me nor my partner (and likely any future partner) are immediately interested in size/length edge-play.
</p>
<p>
So if I eventually have an approx. four inch canal, I can&#39;t imagine how
<strong>
<em>
my
</em>
</strong>
<em>
normal sex life
</em>
would be impacted; in fact,
<em>
I have no idea what I&#39;d do
</em>
with any greater depth.
</p>
<p>
And finally...IMHO if one has a
<em>
partner
</em>
who has a problem with
<em>
whatever
</em>
depth one might have, then I respectfully suggest said partner
<em>
isn&#39;t very good
</em>
and they need to get with the program, or one should find
<em>
a more caring partner
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
Thank you and Best Wishes!
