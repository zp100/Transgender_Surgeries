I have a couple of questions about your SRS (To be honest there are a lot of questions): What made you choose Dr. Bank over other doctors? (Dr. Bank is on my short list and I have doubts who to go with) How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? How consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth currently? How was the dilation process during the recovery? It is painful? Did you request any kind of aesthetics for your vulva? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if you have not undergone one, What would improve your result with one? How is your recovery in Thailand going so far (Chon Buri)? What was the aftercare like for Dr. Bank and the clinic staff in general? And by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

It’s too early to answer most of your questions, so yea
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr Bank mainly because of two things: Dr Suporn’s technique has some exceptional attention to detail and also I wanted big labia minoras. I ended up not asking it explicitly, but I have a decent amount of it (for now). Also he prepares the vaginal lining in a way observed to become mucosa-like in the future (9-12 months), so that’s a huge plus. I’ve heard PAI also does a similar thing, btw, but they’re more vocal about that with their patients.
</p>
<p>
I’m VERY happy with my results so far, and plan to do a revision in the future to consolidate the posterior commisure (and anterior maybe), as this is something which is impossible during primary surgery and I think I want it.
</p>
<p>
Sensitivity is still hard to tell, and the same goes for aesthetics. So I prefer not to say anything about that besides that I think it’ll turn out great :)
</p>
<p>
In terms of depth I explained that in another comment, but it’s 14-15cm depending on how you measure it
</p>
<p>
Dilation isn’t painful right now, but it isn’t too comfortable either. The worst part is being patient, because it takes 50 minutes on a good day to get to depth and 1h30 on bad ones. At this moment, it may still get “worse”, so idk what to tell you. Months 3-4 post op are usually the worse in that sense, but I’ve had longer dilations earlier than most patients, so I may be facing the worst already 🤷🏻‍♀️
</p>
<p>
I’m already at home, and I’m able to do most things that don’t require force or doing weird positions, like cleaning. But being in bed or watching something on the sofa is most advisable for now.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t need any revisions after the primary surgery in Thailand, so Dr Bank didn’t do any significant interventions besides removing some stitches. The aftercare in the hospital is impeccable, and nurses come visit you at the hotel every day.

<p>
No, it’s apart from tunica. The preparation of the scrotal skin to create the vaginal lining involves some steps that seem to result in a tissue similar to McIndoe vaginoplasty. The real deal about that is that there’s a study (reference below) that found out that in about 9-12 months the vaginal lining becomes very similar to a typical cis vagina, in terms of bacteria, pH and cell properties overall. It’s NOT mucosa. But it’s “mucosa-like”. It’s pretty interesting!
</p>
<p>
Aaaaaand then there’s tunica vaginalis. It also isn’t a true mucosa, but it has some Interesting properties. First, it creates a liquid that is quite similar to mucus, which is great. But second, it seems to be very good to the flora inside the vagina. It seems that this fluid it produces is filtered from blood, and that it contains white blood cells (it’s clear, btw), and that could well help “clean” the vagina from pathogens. But that’s not backed by science, at least that I know for now.
</p>
<p>
The issue here: all that I say here is pure speculation. The clinic didn’t confirm any of this. Buuut it’s very logical and it fits better with our experience as patients during recovery than the hypothesis that they don’t prepare the skin to be similar to McIndoe’s.
</p>
<p>
Reference to the paper I talk about: Bekerecioglu, M., Balat, O., Tercan, M., Karakok, M., Ugur, M. G., &amp; Isik, D. (2008). Adaptation process of the skin graft to vaginal mucosa after McIndoe vaginoplasty. Archives of gynecology and obstetrics, 277(6), 551-554.

Thanks this is super interesting! Something I probably care too much about in the grand scheme of things is achieving a lactobacillus dominant microflora, but sadly there is not much research done on this but certainly from incidental research suporns techniques would logically come close to providing the right environment. An interesting question that has been raised is that if a lactobacillus dominant microflora is even the most suited to a neo vagina, and the ideal microflora may even depend on the technique used.
</p>
<p>
You seem pretty interested in this topic as well so I&#39;d love to hear any other research you&#39;ve done, and if you ever planned to get a vaginal microbiome test done after a year or so find out how yours has developed.
</p>
<p>
And also congrats on the surgery, results are looking good so far!

Thank yoooou ❤️❤️ The question you raise about the ideal vaginal flora  is very interesting! And yes, I intend to have some tests done near the 1y mark :) The anxiety I had before surgery and the amount of energy I’ve been putting into my recovery since have kind of prevented me from going deeper into the research that’s out there, but it’s certainly a topic of interest!

I’m now at 8 weeks post op, but this is my best picture so far 😅
</p>
<p>
Please notice that 4 weeks is almost nothing in terms of recovery after GCS with Suporn clinic…
</p>
<p>
And if you have any questions, feel free to ask!

Edit: I’d like to add some dimensions here… I’m 1.64m tall (5’4 approx) and I weigh 53kg, or 117lb approx. And I’m 24 years old.

The surgery was 15600 euros, but then I had some additional costs, like the hotel, flights and so on

There goes me ever getting bottom surgery tbh, that sorta money would be life-changing for me. I&#39;m genuinely stoked there&#39;re girls out there who can afford such procedures to be their true selves. Living vicariously through you rn &lt;3

That sounds pretty cheap, actually. I paid $3100 for an orchiectomy with no hospital stay. It would have been $21000 without insurance.

Funny thing is, without the insurance industry it would probably be $3k anyway. Like in other countries.

Yikes, that sounds like a lot when my annual salary is around 10k euro (kinda above average for my age in my country). At least the flights would be a lot cheaper since it&#39;s right beside my country lol

idk that i ever saw someone post a before...  somehow that really helps... cos it shows what the operation does... less focus on how perfect the result might be... more focus on how massive the change is...
</p>
<p>
i&#39;m supposed to go same place in two months... this makes me more determined to find the rest of money to make sure i can do it...

I got 14-15cm, but Dr Bank explained to me that there’s a limit in terms of hip bone size and surroundings. He also confirmed that I had more than enough material, and I had also asked him to use tunica vaginalis, so I assume that he actually had more than enough to work with.
</p>
<p>
So… had I been a bit bigger myself, I probably would’ve had more depth.
</p>
<p>
But I also didn’t have much of an expectation in terms of depth… 12 or so would’ve been perfect for me already. So he didn’t take it as a priority either

It’s a tissue harvested from the testicles, and it seems to be good for vaginal maintenance and sometimes lubrication. But it’s also excellent to guarantee a good depth when there’s not a lot of tissue from the typical places. By the time I got my surgery, Dr Bank would suggest it to girls with very small penises and wouldn’t suggest but would accept requests from the rest. I asked for it and he used it. I’d say 10%-20% of my vagina is made from tunica 👌
</p>
<p>
Edit: I’ve also heard from some patients at PAI that they’re also using tunica there. No official confirmations, tho

It’s a tough recovery, ngl. But I’m almost 6mo post op and can already work and only dilate 1 time each day (which isn’t extremely common at this stage). Dilations take 2h30 approximately to get done except prep time and cleaning afterwards, but it’s also time that I can use to do menial stuff for my job and so on. I’m a teacher, so there’s actually a lot of it to be done 😅😅😅
</p>
<p>
I could also run, I think, but I’m too lazy and the weather is too bad rn to go out. And I don’t feel confident to try something like yoga at this moment, but it’s something I’d like to do when I have such a confidence. Biking is a big no no at this stage.
</p>
<p>
At the beginning I wouldn’t be able to sit at all, so much so that I flew back in business class even though it cost me a good little fortune. By month 1 at home I started to be able to sit, and nowadays it’s starting to get comfortable to sit in almost any surface and position. Remember: past some point, probably when you’re back at home, hard chairs are your friend. And fluffy ones are a lot worse because they press on the genital area and it’s very uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I think that’s kind of it. Now, I’d like to ask you to do one thing: don’t do like me and freak out about the surgery being sooooo far away in the future. That day will come anyway! Just be prepared to lose your sense of privacy completely while you’re there. It’s quite an experience 😅

Yeah, the girls that go alone tend to have a pretty challenging time there. But they do fine, so you’ll do as well 😊😊
</p>
<p>
Dilating is also challenging at first but then it’s so mundane and boring… anyways, it’s better to have something else to think while you’re doing them hehe

I can understand that and your feeling are valid. My intention was just to be positive not to cause you discomfort or dysphoria. Keep in mind that this is coming from a man of transitional experience. I have experienced both pre and post op women of transitional experience and I automatically wish to calm their feels about their genitals not being....feminine (such as they maybe).  I am not sure if this explanation has helped at all but I will extend a sensrest apology. Particularly, if my comment was understood under the context that your changes are not valid. Honestly, I look forward to having corrective lower surgery in the future. My goal is just to root everyone on. ❤️ Would you like me to delete my comment?

Thanks for the words. I get what you mean, but consider that I’ve been through that surgery for a reason, so yeah 😅 it wasn’t the best of comments before you explained yourself a bit more. But no need to delete it tbh. You probably considered that I was comfortable enough with my “before” because I even posted it, so don’t worry

Three changes I see.  1.your belly is little bit bigger now compared to pre-op with penis one.  2.Before you stand straight. Now when you stand it looks like you are tilted little bit from waistline or hips. 3. Your legs little bit curved from bottom and Your slipper colour changes too.

I didn’t know this would happen, but my belly button seems to be lower now. Right after surgery they wrap your whole groin area, and it weirdly pulls on the belly skin. It’s so weird, but now my belly is (for me) a lot more feminine. The picture may not show this very properly, tho. But it’s something that most girls in the clinic at the time didn’t know would happen but were also pleasantly surprised :)
</p>
<p>
The rest is all a matter of posture. 1mo after surgery I was still struggling to walk and so on, but in the first picture I’m dysphoric and in the second I’m not. So there’s a huge difference in posture resulting from both things.

What was the rough breakdown of costs? Right now that&#39;s the most prohibitive factor for me, and while the thought of it scares me it&#39;s more a fear of complications &amp; bad results that&#39;re gonna cost even more to fix than anything else

Roughly… (in euros)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
surgery: 15600
</li>
<li>
hotel: 1300
</li>
<li>
flights: 900 + 2000 that I had to spend to go back in business (I couldn’t sit properly for so long without damaging myself)
</li>
<li>
food and random stuff there: 500??? Maybe less
</li>
<li>
documents and so on: maybe 100, probably less
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s for me only, but I travelled with a family member to help me there (highly recommend, btw)

What great results.  Congratulations. You must be over the moon!  Sorry to hear about your feeling dysphoric over your voice. My girlfriend was so sure that her voice was wrong. I&#39;ve never once thought of her as have the slightest &#34;defect&#34; in voice (or anything else)
</p>
<p>
I think its fair to say some very popular and by all accounts beautiful women have voices that are in a bit lower pitch and I think men found it sexy not &#34;wrong&#34;   I&#39;m spacing out a bunch of names but Paula Prentiss the actress who did the Stepford wives and all those romantic comedies in the 70s? Christine McVee from Fleetwood Mac are two that standout in my head.
</p>
<p>
Looking as shapely as you do? I would expect the only issue to be the men who oogle you or ask you out.  At least that is what I think.
</p>
<p>
My girlfriend kept doing that app that tells you male or female from a picture and no matter how many zillion times it said female she kept checking. SIGH...  That and wanting to get breast implants when she wears a perfectly  normal (Average) sized bra. And is beautiful.  Thankfully she has &#34;accepted&#34; herself.

You know what?  I think that is actually pretty brilliant.  I wish I knew the quote right but it was in some action flick (Which are totally inane)  &#34;Put your mind into the right space and your &#34;arse&#34; will follow.  And by that I think you have to understand that regardless of what some dope who doesn&#39;t know anything about trans folks think (They don&#39;t count)  Your &#34;legit&#34;and I think your transition is complete except for that self doubt or just putting your mind into the body you have after a lot of work with your doctors etc.  *And hey!  Its payed off!  Celebrate being the real you!  Congrats again.

I&#39;m super glad for you. I&#39;ve seen nothing but good results from suporn over there. I&#39;m leaning towards using them even if I have to find a way to pay them without insurance. Thank you

Heyyy! Feeling better lately, but it’s been some difficult 5 months really 🥲 sensitivity is great except I can’t feel my minoras yet. It’s not guaranteed to be a definitive nerve injury yet, tho, so I’m a bit anxious to see if the nerve recovers or if I’ll never feel that part again 😬. In short, it’s too soon to tell. But I’m also very bad at getting rid of inflammations, so my mons pubis is still very very inflamed and that could be actually blocking the nerve, you know? Let’s see what happens 😅😅😅
</p>
<p>
Now to your question… afaik Dr Bank doesn’t remove any fat layer from the regions that compose the majoras unless you ask him to (to have a flatter vulva). So if you don’t say anything I’d say you’d get the fattest majoras possible. But I’m not sure. Some girls ask for it, tho, and he always says that he’ll have to see during surgery what’s possible and what’s not, but it’s a request he accepts to consider. In my case I didn’t request anything specific, though maybe I ended up saying something about big minoras, but now I don’t remember 😅 the only thing I’m sure is that I love what I got 😊
