Hello everyone! I wanted to heavily document my recovery after surgery with Dr. Gast since there&#39;s limited information out there about her. So let&#39;s get started.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
To begin, about 7 years ago I had an orchiectamy
<strong>
and
</strong>
scrotectamy. I got this due to an assumption I could never afford full surgery, and the extra skin would be annoying. I would highly recommend having more hope than I did if you&#39;re in my situation. Last year, a class-action lawsuit required Wisconsin Medicaid to cover transgender procedures. So I got myself scheduled in to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
My consultation was before COVID-19 hit, and Dr. Gast was very knowledgeable, explaining everything they could to me about the procedure. I&#39;d studdied a lot beforehand and it all lined up with what I knew. We planned for a penile inversion vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I told her due to the previous surgeries I had very little skin to work with, she said she&#39;d do her best and we&#39;d see where things landed. I was honestly so excited I could still even try surgery that I couldn&#39;t complain.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Onto surgery itself. I had surgery on September 2nd, deep into COVID-19 fun times. No, you don&#39;t get visitors or someone to hold your hand before surgery. It SUCKS and I recommend getting yourself set up with phone calls, video calls, anything to get that socializing in.
</p>
<p>
The surgery seemed to go off without a hitch, Dr. Gast was very happy with the results from what she told me. The nursing staff were very kind and some non-binary even, so I felt like I was in good hands.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I hit the &#34;jackpot&#34; and managed to get an ileus. Basically, my digestive system didn&#39;t wake up after anesthesia which lead to a lot of pain and issues. These things just happen sometimes of course, but admittedly it made my already lonely hospital stay miserable. The doctors and nurses did so much to help me get comfortable and get past it though, I&#39;m very thankful.
</p>
<p>
After a week passed and my stomach was starting to finally work again I got to see what I was waiting for.
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/6actGhm">Here&#39;s a pic of my new plumbing 7 days post-op taken by Dr. Gast on my phone.
</a>
</p>
<p>
Look, I was thrilled. With so little skin to work with, I was downright amazed at my luck! Everything looked stunning to me so soon after surgery.
</p>
<p>
The day the packing came out though, was my que to head back on home. Which is where things started to surprise me. I&#39;ve always read you start dilating RIGHT after surgery.
<strong>
Dr. Gast told me I&#39;d be instructed on how at my first post-op appointment and to not worry about it until then.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So, no dilating for me until after September 17th. I felt very nervous about it, but I trusted the doctors. That first week after is kinda hell. I didn&#39;t need anything more than tylenol for pain once I was out of surgery (seriously, I had a single dose of morphine when I woke up, then tylenol only from then after and my pain was controlled really well). but other parts sucked. Daily cleaning out and douching still needed to occur, changing pads out constantly, and to be honest the smell is PRETTY bad. Get used to feeling gross for a bit, it&#39;s okay and it will pass.
</p>
<p>
I got to see one of the in-clinic doctors (not Dr. Gast) for my post-op on September 17th and she was incredibly kind. Showed me how to dilate, checked how healing was going, the works. Turns out I had some delayed healing and what turned out to be granulated tissue started, but this is common enough so nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/eGbZ8zN">Here&#39;s some pictures I took that day before going in
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
We found that I had a bit over three inches tops of depth, which with the lack of skin to work with was understandable. If some penis owner is mad they can&#39;t get balls deep in me? They can find someone else hot to sleep with. I could still reach my prostate, the new g-spot as it were, so I was happy enough with the result. This did make dilating SO important however, I didn&#39;t want to lose what little depth I had.
</p>
<p>
Now at the office dilating was do easy I was beyond baffled. Took the third-largest dilator with literally NO issues. Was told I could likely go a size up as soon as I got the hang of things.
</p>
<p>
Once I got home it was MUCH harder.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ivfgw5/i_just_cant_get_dilation_to_work_need_help/">I even wrote a post asking for help.
</a>
. The best advice I got there was to put on a disposable glove and try to get a handle on things. It helped me figure out the groove and how far things needed to dip down before going back up in a way you just can&#39;t without tactile help. Of course, be very careful if you do this, but I found it worked nicely.
</p>
<p>
After that, I started getting the hang of it better and got that size up incredibly fast. I even pushed to the largest size dilator
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/CalExotics-Inspire-Silicone-Dilator-Pink/dp/B01CYQCNUW">in the kind I was given
</a>
a couple of nights during my last session of the day when I just felt extra stretchy and relaxed. I once again must say, I was utterly baffled at how easy this was becoming. I did this all before my second post-op visit with the doctor.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you heard me right. Largest dilator in barely over a month. I&#39;m still super confused, but I wasn&#39;t in pain and everything was going okay, so I had no reason to complain at all.
</p>
<p>
The second post-op appointment got me another shock. We checked everything out, things looked fine, but that little bit of granulated tissue remained. It had gone down so much on its own but she wanted to see me in a week for silver nitrate treatments in case it couldn&#39;t just finish the job on its own. She was incredibly excited by the progress on the dilators, looked inside, and saw everything had healed up marvelously, and all my sutures had already fallen out. I was healing at some wildly rapid pace, no idea how but I&#39;m not one to hate a good thing when I see it
</p>
<p>
One week later was this past Monday, which is why I&#39;m writing this post now. We did the silver nitrate treatment which does make you look a little funny down there.
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/FSpSC2x">I have a picture of it right after it was done, and then how it looks today after dilating a bunch and such.
</a>
. It didn&#39;t sting for me or anything but seriously helped. I can always get another treatment, but it may not be necessary even.
</p>
<p>
Now, I got the bombshell of a lifetime dropped on me. I was cleared of all medical restrictions post-surgery. That&#39;s right, I was told I could start lifting however much weight I wanted, exercise, and the part that shocked me the most: touch myself. Now, doctors have a pretty big variety on this one, but external touching VERY gently seems to be held off for the 2-3 month mark minimum. Full-on sex of course sometimes farther.
</p>
<p>
But no, I was told I could start basically doing whatever I wanted sexually so long as I was careful and it didn&#39;t hurt or cause bleeding. Of course, I&#39;d probably want to wait for that granulated tissue to settle, but still.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if I am an extraordinary case for some reason and healing just was a miracle, but if the whole waiting to dilate thing got me bad... This was a jaw-dropper.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I kinda tried, mostly stuff touching the outside, and things just aren&#39;t back enough yet. But it did feel pleasant and nice, my body certainly reacted, and I could find my clit nicely. She&#39;s cute and perky!
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Currently, I&#39;m waiting for my next post-op appointment. This will be the first time I actually see Dr. Gast herself in clinic since surgery. That&#39;s November 12th, so hopefully, I can have some reasons behind my miraculous healing soon.
</p>
<p>
That and ask the big question. You&#39;ve likely seen from the pictures, that when my legs are closed? I have a pretty solid looking labia. The moment everything opens, it&#39;s like I still have half a labia but... That&#39;s it. That and I&#39;m instantly kinda opened up already.
</p>
<p>
This doesn&#39;t look like a proper vagina should, or even a slightly awkward post-op vagina should. I know that with swelling or anything else that things take time to settle in. But with how fast healing has been everywhere else, those words aren&#39;t too comforting right now.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, I can get some answers and see if this is just where I&#39;m stuck from lack of skin, though I hope that&#39;s not the case. We&#39;ll see though, and I promise to keep you all updated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Now, if you&#39;ve got any questions ask! Don&#39;t be shy, I tried to keep things mostly light, but can get into deep detail if people want. I&#39;m not shy about this, just ask away.

Thank you so much for sharing!!!! There&#39;s so few pics/accounts of surgery with Gast.
</p>
<p>
How &#34;personable&#34; did you find her? Did she seem curt/short?
</p>
<p>
Crazy that you&#39;re cleared for everything- hope healing continues to go well for you!

My initial visits with her, pre-surgery, and right after, were quite lovely. Now, I mostly see another doctor in clinic which is VERY worth noting. The facebook group out there discussing surgeries with Dr. Gast has some accounts that she&#39;s not fun to work with at times.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had that experience, but I haven&#39;t had as many experiences with her directly yet. I&#39;ll be sure to talk about myfirst direct appointment with her next update :3

Yep, I’m in the FB group, which is why I asked!
</p>
<p>
I can sympathize with her that some members of any community can be difficult to deal with, especially the trans community... No matter what you do, there’s someone out there who has a problem with it.

Thanks so much for posting this! Dr. Gast is on my list of possible surgeons in a few years, so its super helpful hearing your experience! Anything in the process that you were unhappy with? How long was the wait list? How much hair removal was required?

I feel lucky here, even with the COVID delay that stopped &#34;non-essential surgeries&#34; I only had to wait about a year to get in.
</p>
<p>
I mean, I wish I didn&#39;t get an ileus but... Besides that I&#39;ve been quite happy overal. It was weird to not be dilating so soon, but it really didn&#39;t seem to effect things. I usually do see a different doctor in clinic than Dr. Gast which is odd? But she&#39;s so nice I have zero complaints there.
</p>
<p>
For hair removal, it wasn&#39;t all that bad. I managed to do it in under a year, every other week for an hour in eletrolysis. If that helps!

i had surgery with gast at the beginning of june and if its any consolation my bits are just barely starting to look &#34;normal.&#34; (not that there is a standard vulva) I was also told I was healing quickly and cleared for any activity pretty quickly after surgery.

Well see, maybe I really do just have to wait, that&#39;s legitimately comforting to hear. I just want to be able to look down after the legs spread and it&#39;s not too obviously off

Congrats on being able to get your surgery, that’s awesome!  (I am female to male, so I don’t know much about MTF SRS), but I’m curious to know, do y’all have to do stages? And what exactly is granulated tissue?

<p>
That depends, for MTF folks if you want a &#34;truly realistic&#34; vagina, you&#39;ll need at least one revision. The way your entrance is placed isn&#39;t quie anatomically correct but needs to be that way so you can dilate properly. Minus that... It&#39;s not necessary!
</p>
<p>
And the short version, granulated tissue is a spot healing that gets really angry and swells up/gets bigger/more aggressive as a healing mechanism. It&#39;s not actually very helpful for healing though, gets irritated, and likes to bleed a bit.

Thank you for the information! I’ve been on this forum for quiet a bit and see mostly MTF, and it’s very interesting. Since I’ve never needed to do research on this part I’m not very knowledgeable about it. So I appreciate you answering my questions!! Hope you heal well!! 🤗

Nah I mention this in the post, everything is a little odd right now. The bottom area is where dilating happens yes.
