I am interested in you experience with the surgery and also how often are people able to get in when on the waitlist.  I booked 3.5 years in advance and am now 1.5 years on the list.  I am local and that is supposed to help but I hear that she moves the young women to the head of the line which may make sense to her but I find it unsettling if true.

Hi! So, you&#39;re absolutely right that she does move young women ahead in the line which is not fair I admit of course, but for me the only way I would&#39;ve been able to get the surgery so I&#39;m very fortunate. It would&#39;ve been extremely difficult to move away for college and go through the surgery on my own instead of being able to get it when I was 18. I think this is the main reason Dr. Bowers moves young women ahead. Aside from that, I&#39;m not sure I could recommend her to be honest. I don&#39;t think she was honest about the potential risks and side effects. Every girl that had the surgery with her that I&#39;ve met has had: granulation tissue, severe bleeding after leaving hospital, and many even have issues with internal hair growth. My advice is to get laser hair removal!! Even if they say they can get rid of it pre-surgery. Know the risks, and also know you&#39;ll probably only see Dr. Bowers once or twice before the surgery. I never saw her again. :/ Her assistant (with no medical degree a google search found out) removed the packing and gave dilation instructions but she was never there for a follow up, even at the hospital. I wish you the best! And feel free to ask me anything- C

THanks for the reply and explanation.  Aside from the complications were you happy with the aesthetics and function?

I am actually! Surprisingly everything turned out okay but I ended up doing surgery on myself to correct the granulation tissue after a stitch popped and Dr. Bowers was no help whatsoever. She barely answered her phone. All of this led to hospitalization where the doctors told me &#34;you did well, but never do surgery on yourself again!&#34;

Functionality wise, I have 0 complaints and was able to orgasm after 3 months. My boyfriend also tells me he can&#39;t tell I wasn&#39;t born Cis. :)

It’s really debatable I guess. Are we staying in the US?

Is there a specific surgery you want or reason you want to go to her?

I like her experience and approach. I consulted with her and was very happy with how she addressed my concerns. Also had a super review from a friend who had her surgery with her. I have consulted with other dr.s and had discussions with others who had gone to MqGuin and Satterwhite and Brassard and none of the others impressed me quite as much. It is a somewhat subjective decision unless of course the surgeon is incompetent. But there are many excellent surgeons out there that do this surgery.

I never said she was, I’ve actually seen a couple of hoer protégés work in Colorado and he did amazing surgeries but for me I’ll pas on the wait. I specifically want ppt and I plan on a revision labiaplasty so I’m going to Wittenberg. If I was getting PI I’d probably go to Suporn or Chet. But since I want ppt I think Wittenberg is the most experienced for that surgery. I’m planning my labiaplasty with Toby Meltzer. I like his aesthetic a lot but he only does PI.

Interesting.  My friend went to Wittenberg and had quite a few complications but she is kind of high maintenance anyway.  Its funny that everyone has a story about this or that doctor.  I have read and my therapist tells me that Meltzer is very good.  There is a book called &#34;It never goes away&#34; and the author had a revision from him that she was very happy with.  Is Suporn still doing surgery?  I have thought about Thailand and seen some results that are amazing. But, I thought he had retired.  Best of luck to you.

Suporn is not but his clinics is still overseen by him and his disciple which is dr banks I think. I’ve heard really great things

I think two step is the way to go so I don’t think Wittenberg will be enough and that’s why I’m already planning on labiaplasty.

I think you have a pretty wise approach.  Srs was a two or multistage surgery until the 1990s.  Suporn, Meltzer and Sanguan still use a two stage approach (Suporn via his free revisions if needed).
