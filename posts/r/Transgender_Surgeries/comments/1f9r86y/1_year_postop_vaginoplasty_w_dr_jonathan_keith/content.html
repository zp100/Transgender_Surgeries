Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
I rarely post to Reddit and this is certainly my first time doing anything like this, so bear with me.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR: I have almost no depth from my vaginoplasty but don&#39;t regret doing the surgery. I&#39;m just not sure if I should look at revision options.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not here to scare anyone off if you&#39;re considering it, but I&#39;m just writing about my experience and looking for advice, if anyone&#39;s been along this road before.
</p>
<p>
I had MTF vaginoplasty last September w/ Dr. Jonathan Keith (plastic) and Dr. Nitin Patel (urology). I originally went in looking for zero depth, but after some conversations with the team there and with my wife about how difficult revision would be if I started with zero depth, I decided to go full. I&#39;m only attracted to women, but figured there might be fun in fingers, toys, etc.
</p>
<p>
The surgery went fine. I had penile inversion with peritoneal grafting. As far as material, I didn&#39;t exactly have much to work with beforehand, if you catch my drift. According to my operative report, I originally wound up with six inches of depth. Today, I only have 1.5 inches or so.
</p>
<p>
A big part of this is that the hospital couldn&#39;t set my IVs properly. I had six fail on me, leading to huge bruises all along the backs of my hands and both forearms. Dr. Patel switched me to oral antibiotics. I was also on oral oxycodone, naproxen, and a few things to help soften bowel movements post-op. Otherwise, things seemed great that first week. I ambulated well, could get in and out of bed without issue, ate fine, all that jazz.
</p>
<p>
Apparently, the oral antibiotics weren&#39;t strong enough, because I wound up with a suprapubic infection so bad they had to leave the catheter in an extra week. The only sign I had, which I should&#39;ve picked up on but I&#39;m blaming oxy brain fog, was that I occasionally had slight chills. I thought my room was just cold. I&#39;d curl up under the covers, take a nap, and wake up fine.
</p>
<p>
The way Dr. Keith&#39;s office does it, you don&#39;t have packing in or dilate that second week. During that time, the infection got worse, to the point of my pubic area being hugely swollen and an ugly red. They got me on stronger antibiotics and added a second right away, but also instructed me to start dilating. With all the swelling, it was a horrific experience. Agonizing. It hurt everywhere--my ureters, colon, pelvic floor, everything. Try poking an infected cut and think about dilating that cut. Yeah. Thankfully, I was able to keep the catheter out as of the same day.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the infection cleared. I wound up with a UTI though so after 3 weeks on, one week off, oral antibiotics, I went back on them for another week. I decided to try dilating again and it wasn&#39;t that bad, so I kept it up since. Followed the surgeons&#39; instructions despite how cumbersome 3x daily can be.
</p>
<p>
Now I have almost no functional depth. Aesthetically, things look great, beyond some scarring where I had a bit of wound separation along the groin. Sensation works amazing too--I have no difficulty achieiving orgasm. If anything, sometimes, things could calm down a little bit. The peritoneal graft provides ample lubrication, and if I stick to fingers, I don&#39;t need any lube, which is amazing.
</p>
<p>
But, I&#39;m disappointed about the depth. Frustrated. Angry, even. The surgeon&#39;s office says I can discuss options for depth at my next visit, but I still can&#39;t think back on that initial post-op period without my vision going dark at the edges (yes, I&#39;m in therapy, about that and generally). I don&#39;t remember that first month out of the hospital, beyond playing CP2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty expansion. I kinda want to have functional depth, even if just to play with myself in a fully actualizing way. I don&#39;t want to keep feeling like I &#39;failed&#39; at vaginal upkeep. But that first surgery was a lot, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll be worth it, necessarily.
</p>
<p>
I want to be clear about something: Dr. Keith and Dr. Patel are both great surgeons. Their offices have wonderful staff. Despite my post-op experiences, there wasn&#39;t one moment where I didn&#39;t feel like I had their complete attention and support. I haven&#39;t talked to them about the options so I don&#39;t know what Dr. Keith will suggest, but I know I&#39;d be in good hands. I have six autoimmune conditions, so I don&#39;t heal as well as other people, and sometimes, shit just happens. In this case, it happened to me.
</p>
<p>
That being said, for those of you who had revisions: were they worth it?
</p>
<p>
And for those of you who have full depth: was *that* worth it? Or did depth ultimately wind up being something that was fun to have, but not a major part of your life?
</p>
<p>
Feel free to share anything relevant about your experiences, of course.

I&#39;m an anomaly--I haven&#39;t exactly talked to his other patients, but they said most end up with 4-6 inches. I have two friends who are also going with him for surgery, though neither have yet.
<br>
I skipped probably two weeks of dilation, then when I did, I dilated 3x daily for 15 minutes at a time, per their instructions. I may have also moved up in width too quickly when I did get into dilating, which can make it difficult to reach deeper. I asked about issues with infection or severe swelling at my initial consultation; they said about 5%, if I remember correctly, so I was in the unlucky few.
<br>
I do believe the peritoneal graft is done for all patients. I don&#39;t know how they all take it, but honestly, that part was the best/easiest aspect of this. The self-lubrication is, well, quite effective. My abdomen was pretty sore for like 2-4 weeks after the procedure though. That&#39;s the only drawback, and it&#39;s not like the soreness was just from the graft.
<br>
I don&#39;t think I lost depth to the autoimmune disorders themselves, but I do think they made me more prone to infection and also slower to heal.
<br>
Don&#39;t discount him just from what I wrote! I swear, my ONLY issue is lack of depth. Everything else went fantastic. If you&#39;re considering him, hear him out for a consult; you can always see someone else if you don&#39;t like how that visit goes.

Both absolutely fantastic. The clit is kinda big compared to a cis woman&#39;s, but I personally like that aspect. Easy to find and extremely sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Aesthetically great overall, though not much labia minora. He told me this would be the case going in, though.

Oh, gods, much better. I don&#39;t have an exact size, but it&#39;s like a little marble of nerves embedded under the clittoral hood. It doesn&#39;t look anything like a tiny penis head worn on top of the labia like the world&#39;s worst hat.

<p>
Edited my above response to mention that I don&#39;t have much labia minora.
