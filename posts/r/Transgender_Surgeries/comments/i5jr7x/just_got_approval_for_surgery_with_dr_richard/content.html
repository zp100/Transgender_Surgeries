You&#39;re welcome. To be short, I am not totally satisified with how everything went. I don&#39;t want to tell Dr. Fakin wouldn&#39;t have done everything he could and I knew he wasn&#39;t experienced that much at that time. Also to be considered is that I had a surgery date with Dr. Suporn at this time, which I had to cancel due to financial reasons and waiting for a new date would have taken longer than until his retirement. I&#39;m guessing this is as well at least partly making me having regrets about chosing Dr. Fakin. I didn&#39;t had any major complications and nor do I have today, except the vaginal entramce where excessing skin can get sore and hurt by having sexual intercourse. I am not satisfied mostly about the outer appearance, especially the clitoris, which is to large. Also, I am missing a clitoral hood totally, which can make me feel uncomfortable through the touching of the clothing. Though he repeatedly promised throughout the year after surgery he will be able to make a revision, he then told me it will not be possible. Depth is good, even though I lost a little in the first 3 days after the surgery.

Thanks for your honesty. I really appreciate it. I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t a complete success.

Thank you! I should have taken more time for making this decision and with getting clear to myself with my expecations. I am sure he is a lot more experienced today and may be able to do better.

Yeah, apparently he has at least 60 under his belt (or 40 a year depending on the source) and his complication rate is at 3%. He seems to have two hospitals under his responsibility also. Going places I&#39;d reckon. I hope you can find some resolution for your own situation some day.

Thereâ€™s a tiny bit on him in the wiki
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
It looks like heâ€™s moved. Do you have any other information on him?
</p>
<p>
Could you make a post afterwards to say how it went and help those who follow after you.
</p>
<p>
Why did you pick him?

I picked him because of the fact he trained in Thailand and name dropped some surgeons from there including Kamol, whom I was planning to go with but with the travel restrictions wasn&#39;t able to and he uses similar techniques. He rang me while he was on holidays to do my video consultation and we talked about all the various techniques and pros and cons and I just got a really good impression from him. I also had a question and he was super quick to get back. The process from initial contact has been from start to nearly finished, two days which was just fantastic and also my fiance really likes him and his demeanor also. The hospital looks really good, has good reviews and my fiance can stay there while I recover also. She speaks Spanish as her first language too which will help everything go smoothly.
