How was it? Where? An are you going to do it? I had my vulvoplasty done just three moths before the Covid Pandemic we have now in October 2019 and returned to work in December just months away from it. I had my vulvoplasty done in Portland, Oregon at Oregon Health and Science University with Dr. Daniel D Dugi III.  I now want to have my vaginoplasty due to stick some toys in me, dilation and want sex, but can’t because I only have a vulva not a vaginal canal yet.

Congratulations!

No questions myself as I just had PIV with Al Kassis at Vanderbilt. Just happy to see another sister get her surgery.

I&#39;m blessed with a high pain tolerance and an ability to step aside from my pain. Even would take naps during electrolysis. It&#39;s definitely uncomfortable as hell and I feel like I need to pee constantly but the catheter is draining well. Packing only sucks because it feels like I need to have a BM and before dinner I&#39;d only had high protein shakes for sustenance for 2 weeks and there&#39;s nothing to move. I mostly want to see her but will have to wait until Friday.

Hey! Could you dm me dr. Selph’s email? I’m trying to get in touch with them but they’ve taken forever to get back to me.

How are the aesthetic results? How prominent is the labia minora? Clitoral hood? Were you circumcised or not before surgery (curious if you had more or less material)? What skin did he use for the labia minora (I
<em>
think
</em>
this is usually penile or scrotal in ppt)?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard you don&#39;t need hair removal with Dr. Selph, did he require any for you?
</p>
<p>
Hows your overall functionality? Do you have full sensation? Have you had an orgasm? What kind of depth did you end up with? Any complications?
</p>

Hi!  I&#39;m considering going with Dr. Selph.  Does he require you to get hair removal/electrolysis in the area before surgery?  Did you see him in his new location in TN, or at his old location in Alabama?  If so, how were the office staff, did they make you feel comfortable?  And of course, how are the results as far as sensation, depth, aesthetics?
