I got GRS with Dr Ramineni in DC 3.5 weeks ago. As soon as I got out of surgery the swelling was horrific and I kept getting told it would go down 90% in two weeks... I was told that again two weeks later.
</p>
<p>
Here at 3.5 weeks its as swollen as week 1 and I cant walk for more than 10 minutes. Aesthetically its horrifyingly bad.
</p>
<p>
Went to get a second opinion by the grace of God from a trans healthcare doctor, who IMMEDIATELY noticed something was wrong IMMEDIATELY found abcesses and turns out per CT scan I have infection inside my labia going towards mon pubis and clitoris which is why the swelling was immense.
</p>
<p>
They cultured it and apparently its a drug resistant bacteria called B fragilis.
</p>
<p>
I kept getting told this is totally fine and normal by first surgeon during my brief checkups! I had a labia separate from the sutures (that was normal?) and swelling get progressively worse and vagina distended.
</p>
<p>
My second opinion doctor/surgeon told me to go to the Emergency room so I can get admitted and treated for this. Get it cleaned.
</p>
<p>
Im so fucking confused and upset by this, this has honestly been the worse experience of my life and I was so looking forward. Its likely not surgeons fault... But I cant help but be surprised how everything was normal when per multiple doctors it was abcessed!
</p>
<p>
Idk, this is rough and I need to vent to others. I feel gaslit by my vaginoplasty surgeon

Ehhhhh If a surgeon cannot recognize an abscess that&#39;s not so hot.  I don&#39;t know if your surgeon saw it in person.  But your surgeon should be FULLY capable of recognizing abscess and delayed swelling.  Its not necessarily their fault for it occurring, but that is a bit worrying

Hes actually seen it four times in three weeks due to me being alarmed by the swelling/distension. Everytime he spent about 30 seconds looking and concluding everything is normal and theres nothing to worry about. So fucking concerning

Yeah that doesn&#39;t sound good.  He should have been able to recognize Abscess was a possibility.  Don&#39;t get me wrong Abscess can be harder to spot when you&#39;re on antibiotics and had major surgery.  But when you&#39;re actively noting something isn&#39;t right, and it turns out something was not right.  Not so good on his part.  Huge hugs, glad they know what is going on now and are getting you in better shape.  Going to be a rough frustrating recovery, grab all the huggles you can from anyone and everyone!

I had a bacterial infection in one of my labia minora around 8 weeks post-op. Massive swelling and holes opened up that resembled staph infections. Went a round of two high powered antibiotics plus Wound Debridement Surgery to clean out the remaining infection and fibrinous tissue it left behind. I&#39;m now a year and a half post-op, and the only evidence of that experience is an extra wrinkle in that labia. At the time, it looked and felt horrible. But it was quickly treatable and resolvable. Hang in there, you&#39;re going to be okay.

Thank you.❤️ Well Im hoping that JH can figure it out in Baltimore. Based on what the doctor said when she called (at like 9 at night lol) Im likely having the same exact things done. Its only 3 weeks post op and im stunned

After years of dealing with medical incompetence from so many Dr&#39;s I have learned that you have to speak up. Speak up for what you feel and don&#39;t back down. No one knows your body better than yourself. You are your best advocate. Don&#39;t hesitate to get a second or even a third opnion. Stand up for yourself and don&#39;t let anyone gaslight you into doubting how you feel.

This is the second time we’ve had a patient on here who had severe, life-threatening complications with this surgeon who was told by that surgeon that things were “fine” and that they should just stay at home and wait for weeks. Like you, they finally went to the ER and in their case found they had multiple fistulas. The doctors who saw them couldn’t believe that their surgeon had told them to ignore what was obviously alarming symptoms, and their vitals were really bad. They ended up with a colostomy. They had all kinds of internal bleeding and stuff.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn’t let this guy touch me with a ten foot pole. I am very sorry this happened to you, but you’re not the first patient to have serious complications that he both missed and who then had to have treated elsewhere.

Im tempted to agree. My JH doctor mentioned a fistula as well when I was seen and two abcesses on the surface. CT Scan showed multiple sacs of infection inside the entirety of the center part and labia and mons pubis. Im fucking appalled like the swelling on one side... Urine coming out 90*. Labia seperating from sutures - NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL. I wish there was more of a warning :/. Off to the ER in a few hours. I honestly could have followed his advice and waited six weeks and ended up getting EXTREMELY sick.

That sounds exactly like what happened to the last patient: even when she was unwell she was released from hospital, and later when she had literal gas and feces leaking from her vagina I believe she was told it was “normal” and told to wait weeks to come in for a normal appointment: We begged her to go instead to the hospital at once because she had feces and blood literally pouring out of her vagina onto her pad, and she did. She was in and out of multiple ERs and had several emergency surgeries and then I don’t know how many repairs. We were all worried sick about her.
</p>
<p>
Please take care of yourself and have a strong advocate to help navigate your care. I’m glad you found a caring medical provider that caught your infection.

The patient with those issues was
<a href="/u/i_am_xs" rel="nofollow">u/i_am_xs</a>
who has since deleted the posts but expressed interest in privately chatting with someone previously and may be willing to talk to OP about her experience and any advice she has

I am so very sorry you are going through this.  The first week or two there is massive swelling normally. Mine went down with ice packs and rest. Definately weeks 3 and 4 should have seen something not right. The swelling,redness, pain,and signs of an abscess/infection should be obvious.  You should have had more than a cursory exam.  Don&#39;t be put off and intimidated,  have your concerns addressed.  I am glad you sought a second opinion.  Infections and dehiscense do happen and are no one&#39;s fault, especially dehiscense like 20 to 25%.  The infection should have been recognized and treated.  I send you  healing and love through this difficult time.  I wish you a speedy recovery. Charlie ps.  Even surgeons are human make sure he knows what he missed in a non confrontational manner so he can learn to listen to patients and not brush them off.

I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you.  Hopefully it gets resolved with no issues.
</p>
<p>
While swelling is normal and does last awhile, swelling from infection is generally very different from standard post surgical swelling.  That surgeon should&#39;ve done their due diligence and at the very least ordered some tests to rule things out.  They definitely should&#39;ve done better and honestly they don&#39;t seem particularly trustworthy.
</p>
<p>
Either way, again I hope you have a super speedy recovery.

Lol im still experiencing this ride. I had recovered from infection had REALLY bad vaginoplasty results. Got a revision five weeks ago- MY LABIA TOTALLY DIHESCED AGAIN and things dont look great... now im waiting for my THIRD REVISION in May.... 👁👄👁. Buyer beware. Dr Ramineni is great I love him personally but this situation is taxing. Not to mention Im already having more issues again five weeks out and have spent about 10k already with BCBS... just to be at the shitty incomplete point Im at now.😅.
</p>
<p>
Edit. All my revisions have been and are being done by Dr Ramineni. I saw another doctor but the waiting period was about a year and I cant wait a year for things to be usable or look not horrid
</p>
<p>
I like Dr Raminenis (pictured) work but dont know why im having such a horrific time. Maybe not enough tissue harvested the first time and the labia pulls away each time. I also formed massive scar tissue... And an infection might be back inside the labia in some of the new revision&#39;s suture lines but Idk yet. Could be my body but idk now
