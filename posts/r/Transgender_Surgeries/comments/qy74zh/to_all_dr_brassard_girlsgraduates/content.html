Hi,
</p>
<p>
I was just wondering if anyone who got SRS with Dr. Brassard in Montreal, Quebec, Canada felt &#34;different&#34; after their operation, as in not as sharp mentally, not feeling as good, body not responding in the normal manner it used to before the op. Did your overall health deteriorate post-op and were you always puzzled by this?  Did you feel &#34;off&#34;? Did you feel something inside your body near the site of operation, as in sutures or like something had been left inside?
</p>

What sort of timing do you mean?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s within the first weeks, it&#39;s logical. Surgery is EXHAUSTING, healing from it even more so. Your body is sending all resources to recovery. Also, there are various types of sutures under his technique, some that are used that last anywhere up to 12 weeks (but normally 6-8).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you mean more like, 6 months or a year later, then I&#39;d ask if you had your hormone levels ran recently, modification of hormone therapy is needed for most people, you may have too much estrogen now, or may need a microdose bit of testosterone.

My question is really directed at girls who&#39;ve had their op with Dr. Brassard and finding out how they felt YEARS after the operation? Sorry, should have been a little more precise. I&#39;m looking for FEEDBACK from others about their experience, not advice.
</p>
<p>
I had my SRS in late 2005 so long time ago...and I tried a lot of different HRT combinations, low, high estrogen, low, high progesterone and some T. Been there, done that! Thanks though. :)

Oh, okay, that was unclear. I&#39;m a year n change post and I went from &#34;disaster&#34; for three months to &#34;wahhhh&#34; for several months months to &#34;tiiiired&#34; til a year, but I feel fine now.
</p>
<p>
....You&#39;re setting off my medical mind now. That&#39;s strange that you&#39;d be feeling that after that long. And I&#39;m presuming that they&#39;ve researched the other obvious stuff like anemia and assorted deficiencies. Uh. I&#39;m... willing to be an additional opinion on all that stuff for whatever it&#39;s worth, privately or here, but I&#39;m just a quack not-a-doctor-but-should-be, so won&#39;t inappropriately presume and pry. :P

I did, yes. Should have specified that. Canadian girl here. In addition to my own, have been directly involved in the intial months&#39; healing of other girls who got theirs between 2011? and 2019.

Hey! I had srs with dr. Brassard in 2018, and have definitely experienced some of the same stuff you described. However, I&#39;m sure that much of my tiredness/depression is due to pre-existing mental health stuff. I did have some complications, and I remember that they used dissolvable sutures on me (that took months to dissappear), but overall, I&#39;m so much happier than I was pre-op, and I do feel that I was well taken care of during surgery and in recovery.
</p>
<p>
With that said, I do have some skepticism about the Montreal clinic...
</p>
<p>
I remember reading about the amount of patients Dr. Brassard takes after surgery, and I was really surprised to find out how many people are cycled in every week. When I was there, I think there were about 3 other girls who had surgeries with Dr. Brassard throughout 2 days. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if surgeries are rushed/overly streamlined.
</p>
<p>
I definitely think we need more branches of SRS clinics around Canada, since most people&#39;s Healthcare only covers the Montreal clinic (that was the case for me). I also heard that there are limited accessible rooms at the recovery centre and a lot of people haven&#39;t been able to get surgeries in time because of that.
</p>
<p>
Do you suspect there any specific links to Dr. Brassard&#39;s surgical technique and long-term depression/fatigue/other health problems? Or is it more to do with the after-care?
</p>
<p>
This is a really interesting conversation, and sorry for the long rant lol ♥️♥️

I did and I’m 4 years post up and it’s getting worst. Some pain are showing. Labias getting bigger one side and not the other.
</p>
<p>
I guess that’s what you get for getting a SRS done by him in 1:30 minute. As long as he can process more girls and do surgery even faster who cares about the life of people after.
</p>
<p>
The day this guy will loose his license and go in jail will be a great day for the trans community.
