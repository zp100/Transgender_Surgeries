FYI if you do not want to know my reality on this topic please do not read. I am venting because I need to.

<p>
I just had my third hour long session of genital electrolysis.  It SUCKS.  I do not drink caffeine 24 hours before hand.  I drink so much water I am bursting.  I put on my prescription 5% lidocaine cream 30-60 minutes before (tried both).  I literally am having trauma from this experience.  I have not needed any painkillers for 10 sessions of laser hair removal on my face.  I have had microblading on my eyebrows.  I have gotten tattoos.  I thought I had a pain tolerance.  What is wrong with me?  I can last about 30 minutes and it feels uncomfortable but I can bear it.  I can listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks.  But inevitably sometime between the 30 minute and 50 minute timeline it becomes UNBEARABLE.  I don&#39;t know how some switch flips that makes all of the pain so intense.  IT goes from an annoying throb to a PIERCING pain, TWICE, each time.   I thought maybe the lidocaine was wearing off so I only applied it 20 minutes before todays sessions.  It still increased in pain at the same time through the session and then I am sweating and shaking and crying, or cry laughing, or on the verge of a meltdown for the last 10-20 minutes.   I DONT GET IT.  On top of that I have restless leg syndrome so when it hurts, my legs twitch horribly and I am sure I am a terrible patient for my tech because I cannot keep it from happening.  Then I get more upset, then it hurts more, then I twitch more.  Seriously.......I have actually questioned having surgery down there because I do not know if I can continue this procedure.  How do people do this voluntarily for purely hair removal purposes?

Just did an hour long session which was 90% better after switching to EMLA cream from 5% Lidocaine.  I also took 2 ibprofen an hour before and 2 right as I went into appointment, plus a Xanax .5 mg an hour before.  I applied the cream and hour before and actually felt my genitals going completely numb, which I never felt at all with the lidocaine.  It even seemed to continue to get more numb as the technician was working on me.  I can do this!  Thank you so much for all the tips!

You might want to seek a provider who can do injectable lidocaine. The injections are quite uncomfortable but after that, it‚Äôs painless and you can go several hours at a time without feeling anything. It can be hard to find a provider that can do it. I fly out to Pennsylvania and get it done at dr. Mcginns office.

IIRC, $105/hour for electrolysis with injections, $85/hour without.

I believe this is her pricing if you intend to have surgery with her. If you are going with a different surgeon, they charge $135 or $145/hour for lidocaine electrolysis

Thank you so much!

Is there any issues with doing multiple hours in one session versus going weekly? I know our hair grows in cycles, but I‚Äôm also trying to figure our what‚Äôs best for my skin.

I don&#39;t do electrolysis there, but they definitely do multi-hour sessions.

Agreed with these prices. I don‚Äôt know the difference between monthly and weekly... just that if I‚Äôm flying out for it I‚Äôd rather do longer sessions less frequently. They can clear large areas in 3.5 hrs whereas 30-60 minute sessions only clear a small section. So I think it would be better to do longer, more complete clearings, but I dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I only have few pieces of advice to offer here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can you switch to EMLA cream (lidocaine + prilocaine)? Remember that prescription numbing creams are not like lotion, you don&#39;t rub them in. You just apply a thick layer and then cover it with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. If you&#39;re already doing that, you might be one of the lucky ones (like me) for whom that stuff just wears off too fast. Tylenol helps.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Is your tech using a newer machine? After seeing a number of electrologists, it&#39;s been my experience that the age and cost of the machine are directly related to the pain level. I once had a tech who was extremely knowedgeable and experienced, but she was using a 30-year-old machine and it was torture. Another tech had a brand-new top-of-the-line machine but barely knew how to use it, and the pain level was almost nothing. My current tech has a newer but less expensive machine, but she is very skilled with it and the pain is there but not too bad.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Otherwise, talk to your tech. See if you can switch probes, or change machine settings. Is it the zap that hurts? Switch to a shorter pulse, or multi-flash. Is it the hair-pulling-out that hurts? Increase the power. Try insulated probes. I discovered that for me, doing thermolysis using a blend probe works the best for me. My tech and I can&#39;t explain it.
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If all else fails, ask your doctor about getting lidocaine injections prior to electro (would require some logistics, I&#39;m sure), or else find a different tech.

Thanks for all the tips, I will look into the cream.  Yes I am piling it on think and wrapping with Saran Wrap.
</p>
<p>
I will have to talk to the tech about age of machine.  She was recommended from my surgeon and makes me feel super welcome and comfortable, but I never asked about the equipment....she did say she used a smaller probe this last time

Well, HUGE difference!  I am actually posting this while 55 minutes in.  I almost don‚Äôt feel most of them and the few I did I am sure was my failure to get the cream far enough.  I did emla hour before, 2 ibuprofen hour before and 2 right before going in.  I also took a Xanax.  I feel like I can actually do this now!  Thanks so much!!!!

It sucks. It‚Äôs been one of the worst parts of transition for me. But, the day my electrolysis told me there was no more to do... I cried and I was sooo happy I put myself through it. Now all I‚Äôm doing is waiting to set a date for surgery, but with this pandemic, who knows when that will be.

My wife found no solution to this other than to go to a provider that provides lidocaine injections. We fly to Phoenix, AZ and go to Senzo Pelo Med Spa for it. Instead of a 30-90 minute torture session, she get&#39;s 13 hours (two techs) that do her face and groin at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Benefits:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Only having to grow out a beard once every other month.
</li>
<li>
Clearing whole area at once.
</li>
<li>
Completely pain free.
</li>
<li>
Drury Hotel has free drinks and dinner that night when I take her back.
</li>
<li>
LITERALLY PAIN FREE!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Expensive. (Although a cost benefit analysis showed it was cheaper to do it all at once this way, then to do individual appointments.)
</li>
<li>
Requires travel.

It&#39;s $90 an hour for the electrolysis, and the lidocaine/nurse costs between $231-$286 depending on how much is needed. That was on a 12 hour trip.
</p>
<p>
This is actually less than the only place local to us that costs over $100 an hour, and then has a lidicaine/nurse charged $75 for only an hour. They didn&#39;t even allow more than an hour at a time.
</p>
<p>
If you have family, that would really reduce costs!

I now love this idea.  Only problem is I am not going to get on a plane during a pandemic.  Does anyone know of this service done on the east coast?  Someone else suggest McGinn in PA but I thought we have read too many horror stories about her surgery results and refusal to acknowledge or fix mistakes....

We‚Äôve had to curtail during this and hope to resume when things resume. There are spots on the East coast, but we are west coast and I didn‚Äôt research that side of the country.

I haven‚Äôt started electrolysis in preparation for GCS yet, but I‚Äôve started doing it on my face. I dislike it far more than laser. Laser in the bikini/genital area was some of my least favorite parts of laser so I‚Äôm trying to mentally prepare myself for electrolysis in that area. I only do 45 minute sessions though. Talking w/ my tech helps to distract me as well. But seeing some of these comments, I‚Äôm interested in seeking a extended session where I‚Äôm knocked out for getting the genital area done.
</p>
<p>
But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. It sounds like your body is letting you know it‚Äôs limits. You‚Äôre doing the best you can w/ an awful situation that I wish none of us had to go through. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I take 2 ibuprofen an hour before, 2 at the start and 2 half way through. I&#39;ve been doing two hour sessions. It gets difficult in the last 20 minutes or so once the sensation has built up enough. Breathing deeply on a count in and out has been helpful. I also try to laugh when it hurts. I feel like I&#39;m able to trick myself a little.

Im sure my body just experiences this particular sensation differently. I&#39;m an absolute wimp in every other pain tolerance kind of way. I just kind of recognize in the moment that this is necessary to avoid future mental anguish, which is much worse. Also if your tech didn&#39;t mention, those jerks are natural. She said to let them happen. The need builds and it may contribute to increased pain as well.

Honestly i felt better reading this because it made me feel less alone. I broke down sobbing after only 20 minutes of it on my first session despite having had 2 hr electrolysis face sessions, 6 hr tat sessions etc. From what I can tell about myself, the dysphoria compounds the pain so much more. Yeah the pain sucks but just having someone down there even during doc consults is incredibly uncomfortable.

And I feel better knowing I am not alone!  I think dysphoria can play a part, especially when she asks me to grab and help stretch certain parts.

Genital electrolysis has been absolute torture for me. Same with facial electrolysis. Some people are just more sensitive. Numbing creams don&#39;t really do anything for me, either.

You&#39;re not a wimp. It just hurts SO much more than laser, but is more effective.  I would recommend the injectable numbing too.  Topical stuff doesn&#39;t do much for a partially invasive treatment like electrolysis. My electrolysis tech says some people get their dentist to give them Novocaine right before their appointment.

It doesn&#39;t seem like anyone else has really addressed this, but the entire pre-op electrolysis process was extremely traumatic for me, as well. It&#39;s emotionally and mentally grueling. I did lidocaine injections with 3-4 hour sessions, and it was still awful. Lying on the table for that long, having an extremely sensitive area, both physically and emotionally, get absolutely torn up, it feels like. Trying to focus super hard or trying super hard to distract yourself. It&#39;s exhausting.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, navigating the nurses and technicians was very difficult for me, and often times the bedside manner of a lot of &#34;care&#34; providers isn&#39;t always top grade.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m covered in tattoos, have had 20+ laser sessions on my face and genitals, and am 2 weeks post op grs. The electrolysis process had me questioning if I would just quit then and there and throw it all away. It&#39;s an awful process, and you&#39;re not weak or crazy.

I can handle the GRS because I&#39;ll be asleep for most of it.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about being shown how to dilate and future care make me highly uncomfortable, but at that point it will be too late. And I figure I&#39;ll be a bit more used to it at that point.
</p>
<p>
My next step is genital electrolysis (within the next 2-3 months), and I already feel myself withdrawing and shutting down physically and emotionally in preparation. Having someone touch and see me down there now, for such a long length of time, causes me extreme anxiety. And the physical reactions I&#39;m hearing many have many make it worse. It&#39;s already a undignified position to be in, but crying and not even being able to control yourself.. Christ.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always had a high pain tolerance and weird reaction to it, with me laughing when things cross a certain threshold and moaning while getting tattoos. I&#39;ve been considering starting epilating without any numbing to get used to the pain now. What are your thoughts on that?
</p>
<p>
And can you detail more about this lacking bedside manner? I really just want to go in and be ignored. I don&#39;t want conversation, and just want to read while they work.. I know some may try to strike conversation, as a normal tactic to make their clients more comfortable. But that will only make me feel worse. But because humans are vindictive, I fear my desire so remain unsocial will increase the likelihood of unpleasant treatment.

I&#39;ve been epilating for a while now. Each time I epilate, after i get started, it almost starts to tickle. Its a very different process, and you are in control. If that seems like a good step to prepare, then i would go for it. Regardless, I would suggest epilating for legs and arms -- the hair has started to thin and grows back slower and sparser.
</p>
<p>
As far as bedside manner, i had a rude nurse because i was only there for electrolysis and not going to them for my surgery. I had appointments cancelled to make room for their preferred clients, and they bad-mouthed the surgeon i was going to having zero knowledge of where i was going. I was pretty openly criticised for a variety of my practices and made to feel like i should be panicking. Mind you, i was paying a premium price for their services during all of this.
</p>
<p>
The technician also spent an hour each session complaining about her relationship to me, until I said i was tired and put my ear buds in.
</p>
<p>
If you have strong boundaries, you need to just be straight forward and drift off, or whatever you want to do.

Ask for Tramadol. Instead of experiencing the pain your become an observer of it. I used it for my tatoo&#39;s on my shoulderblades and i just didnt really care about the pain üëåüèªüåπ hope this helps

Your guess is as good as mine ü§≠ meby tell him your struggles and say you reseached some options including injectable lidocaine and Tramadol.

I&#39;ll second the recommendation for EMLA, I found it was usually enough for me where 5% lidocaine wasn&#39;t. I understand that other, stronger, prescription mixtures are available such as BLT (benzocaine, lidocaine, tetracaine) but I never bothered looking into it.

How are you going to handle GCS if you can barely get through an hour of this? I dunno what to tell you. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to take painkillers before your sessions. Start with ibuprofen. That will take some of the pain away. The rest is up to you. You‚Äôre stronger than you think you are. Don‚Äôt be scared of the pain or push it away. Embrace it.

It all depends on who your surgeon is.  I have read that surgeons who say it‚Äôs not needed count on hair scraping techniques which have their own list of issues.  I am going to take the safe route for not having hair in my vagina

I&#39;ll respond to you here, question is, why not just do laser? I&#39;m pretty sure it does less damage to your skin.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, get it removed, push through, hair in your vag is not nice or fun.
</p>
<p>
Also surgery isn&#39;t that bad. Dilation is shitty but manageable.

Sure in the vagina itself, but there&#39;s like 3cm where he doesn&#39;t remove it. I&#39;m pissed off because I have hair a few cm into my canal that I don&#39;t know how to get rid of.

Honestly this sounds like me. (Leg Twitch and everything) I don‚Äôt have prescription lidocaine yet though. We have found that if I put cream on 30 mins before I go then my electrolisyst puts it on one side when I get there. We found it just kinda stops working or comes off after 30 mins, so she works one side, then the other when I can start feeling that side. It works pretty well. Also make sure your hair isn‚Äôt too long they it‚Äôs not getting to the skin
