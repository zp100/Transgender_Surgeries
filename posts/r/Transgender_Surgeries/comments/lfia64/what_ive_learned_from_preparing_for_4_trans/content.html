Self advocacy is ðŸ’¯ the best thing someone can do while they&#39;re inside of the medical industry. You gotta speak up &amp; ask questions for yourself, you are the subject &amp; your voice needs to have ground in what&#39;s happening for you. Methods vary because ideas vary from person to person, our prospectives, knowledge &amp; will vary regardless of our assuring titles. It&#39;s super important to grasp what a medical professional is &amp; isn&#39;t weighing, to understand some of their choices they are making with you so everyone can better consent &amp; be more informed with electing your bodily changes for our own health.

<p>
just wanna add my experience here: i had BA and i was thinking i wanted 380 cc MAX (!!), then at my consult my surgeon (local, not known as a â€˜trans surgery providerâ€™) said he only cares what cup size i want and then during the operation heâ€™ll figure out what looks best. I like this approach. i said C cup. he told me he gave me 550 cc before i really even had the gown off and i was like freaking out. Theyâ€™re D or DDs and iâ€™m so so sooo happy with them! looking back, i cant believe how far off my assessment was about how ccs translate to appearance. I have a pic on my profile if u care

Very interesting... Would you be willing to share your general measurements (height/weight/band size/etc?)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read many accounts saying girls wish they had gone bigger, but I&#39;ve also read accounts of surgeons recommending 550-600, but the patient insists on (and ends up happy with) 400-450.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the early stages of planning BA, and size is one of the things that seems so damn hard to decide on!!

When you say 550-600 and 400-450 are y&#39;all giving the combining total cc?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for 275cc left nad 300cc right.

#1 Rule: Advocate for yourself.

<p>
If they refer to you as a complex or difficult patient, you&#39;re doing it right.

<p>
A lot of posts list this but never bring up what they asked. I feel like I&#39;m blanking out on what to even put on a list of questions currently. Also out of those questions often did it conflict between the surgeon or the staff&#39;s answers?

<strong>
Remember.
</strong>
These are Drs who choose their words very carefully. You should too.
</p>
<p>
Ask: How many times have you done this [specific procedure]?
</p>
<p>
With BA you might even ask: How many times have you done this [specific procedure] on Trans-women? It matters.
</p>
<p>
Be specific, don&#39;t ask about a general category like &#34;Gender surgeries&#34;. If you want to know how many PPV&#39;s they&#39;ve done, state that. Don&#39;t just ask about Vaginoplasty.

I&#39;m trying to make a google keep for myself on any possible thing to ask surgeons and insurance. I&#39;m atrocious at this kind of stuff. An advocacy group that can help us sort through this bs would be so helpful.

Yeah. Honestly, I&#39;m beyond tired of trying with the doctors and insurance companies I&#39;ve come across. They&#39;re all just so awful. The doctors have no idea what they&#39;re talking about when it comes to HRT and the insurance covers absolutely nothing, transgender-related or otherwise. Oh, they&#39;ll
<em>
say
</em>
they cover it, but then they have zero providers of said care in-network and don&#39;t give out-of-network benefits, so...yeah. It&#39;s lip service.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s to hoping I can keep seeing tremendous gains in the stock market so I can just pay for this stuff myself. Or I could just wait another year and move to a state that actually has decent insurance because Texas
<em>
sucks
</em>
.

youâ€™re right but holy shit has it been exhausting to be my own advocate in the run up to my bottom surgery with RBL in a couple weeks.
</p>
<p>
i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be getting any other surgeries for a couple years because itâ€™s been so overwhelming to fight ADHD and anxiety while working full time and constantly following up with all my medical providers to make sure everything works.
</p>
<p>
i kinda wish iâ€™d read what you said about McGinnâ€™s office being easy to deal with before i started consulting. i loved Bluebond-Langner and Zhao when i met them and i donâ€™t regret my choice but it has been a struggle for me to interface with their office.

Before I went in for my BA consultation, I did my research and told myself 350. Went to consultation and before I had even changed into a gown, he said 650, maybe 700. Changed into gown and tried 350 - no good. Tried 650 - just right. Still had trouble convincing myself the surgeon was right. Also asked opinion of several office staff members. Been happy with 650 ever since!!
