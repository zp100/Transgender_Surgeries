Hey! Trans guy here! My labia majora wrinkle exactly like that in some positions, including the one you are in in this photo. I can’t comment on much else, but figured this might be soothing to hear :) It looks really nice and natural to me at least in that regard.

You are swollen but the anatomy is mostly correct. You can get a revision and address all those concerns once you&#39;re a 6-12months recovered. It is fixable, most people can achieve a spectactular result with a revision, very few with the first result

I’m over a year post op, and it’s honestly shocking how much my tissues have changed for the better in that time.  I can vividly remember feeling distraught by the appearance of my vulva at around the 1.5-2 month time.  Now I am much more pleased with everything down there, though I still plan on revision to address some issues, and I honestly think your results will look incredible; however, like me, you may need revision.

I&#39;m feeling no, you aren&#39;t. I&#39;m not totally happy with mine, but you look so much more natal. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all seen thousands of vulva over the Years but you look great. It&#39;s very soon after it takes up to a year to fully heal. How is the sensation, which is the most important part to me. Don&#39;t forget labia is kind of easily moved, all are different but you look good, honestly.

As your body heals and the swelling goes down you might have your second issue resolve itself and as for the wrinkle &#34;issue&#34;, id watch - genuinely- some cis specific porn and see the myriad of different ways vaginas look. I for one think you have a delightfully aesthetcally pleasing vagina. Also consider we&#39;re getting into the colder months - so you could just be cold. Or some people super overcompensate and get super warm under 200 layers of thick clothes and overheating i think can cause similar wrinkles- idk looks like a vagina to me. Do you have a follow up appointment scheduled? If you do then id wait for that and if its still not to your liking then bring it up... otherwise there&#39;s the long game of moving to a country that has better priced revisions... or save up to pay for the out of pocket

I think you look great and you&#39;re only a month and a half out!! Between now and one year, there will be a lot of change as it takes about that long to fully heal.

It looks pretty good for that early and no revision. They come in sooo many shapes. Maybe have a look at one of those huge collections of different, just to see yourself that they all are just a bit different and not that one look we kinda envision.

Looks like a spectacular result to me. Only concern I&#39;d have is the hair growing around the clitoris. Might want some laser hair removal on that area once your sutures and scar tape come off for the last time.

Hey I wanted to say that the wrinkles look perfectly natural and natal vulvas have that too!! I personally think you’re looking great and wish you luck with your recovery!! if you’re still struggling with dysphoria and these feelings after a few months be sure to reach out to your surgeon!!

Definitely not botched, and in 6-12 months you still don&#39;t like the aesthetics, a minor labia majora revision should be way way less expensive than your original surgery, especially since it can probably be done with local anesthetic.

Post op vaginas are often a bit gapey due to lack of musculature of the vagina but yours looks less so than others I&#39;ve seen. Other than that it looks pretty good tbh

Looks very good to me and there seems nothing botched about it. Give it some time to heal (at the very least 6 months). Your vagina and vulva will change a lot in this time and after that as well 🤗

I want to acknowledge your feelings but we have to stop using the word botched so lightly. There are botchings and then there are less than ideal results. There are too many women on here that come and then spiral bc they have unrealistic expectations for what vaginas look like. This includes me. It’s just such a scary process and to hear everyone crying wolf botch is highly stressful.

I&#39;m aware of this, that is why I said I feel botched and not that I am botched, as in, my personal expectations have not been met so far, which to me translates to being botched.
</p>
<p>
However I understand how it still would be triggering, so for that I apologize. I might delete this post soon anyway.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I would like to add that this is a surgery that I&#39;ve waited for for 5 years, technically more if I count the dysphoria I&#39;ve dealt with even before I even was aware of what it was, so I really want the results to be as good as possible, and given how much I&#39;ve suffered from dysphoria, alienation and stigmatization for being trans, I feel like the least I could aspire to is to have my wishes met by one of the only two gender affirming surgeries that my country&#39;s healthcare covers for trans girls.

It&#39;s still very early into your recovery. I know that it can feel like it&#39;s been a lifetime since you got the surgery, but 1.5 months is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Personally, I think it looks fantastic. If you&#39;re unhappy, it&#39;s valid, but it looks very natal to me, and clearly many other people here.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re going for a revision for all these concerns, I&#39;d highly suggest you wait a while longer, maybe until the 6 month mark, to really let things settle.

You look like you got a great result honestly.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re only a month out. You&#39;re still hugely swollen and inflamed. Mine kept changing for maybe two years.
</p>
<p>
Your labia minora and Majora already look well within cisgender range of variation. In three months, it will look so much better.

Yeah, initially that&#39;s what motivated me to post, knowing that I had no reference to look up when I was getting into the procedure, and I wanted others to have at least one example. However, right now I&#39;m feeling like a Guinea pig tbh. I just feel wronged.

Trans dude here, have seen other vulvas that look like this, think you&#39;ve got some of the best results I&#39;ve seen though I must admit I mostly look at surgery results for dudes.

It looks ok, except for the hairy clit. You also have some hair inside, usually there is no hair on the inner parts..  you will have a lot of problems shaving it. Try some other ways, dont know.
</p>
<p>
Btw what are 2 openings that i see? Lower is the vaginal canal? What is the upper one?

Literally didn’t even read the caption and I thought you looked really great. Don’t see much concern from me but I don’t know much. Good luck !

I would love to have that nice of a result. Unless you want it to look prepubescent, there should be some folds. You should be glad it&#39;s so symmetrical. Mine was butchered, and now a month out from a full revision and still very torn up and lopsided. You can have a revision to pull the labia down some to help cover the gap after healing. You&#39;re kinda bitching with your mouth full. You should see some of the fails on here, and also check out wall of vulvas.
