Been looking through threads, struggling to find one that can give me details on breasts surgery MTF in Australia, preferably Sydney. After info on what doctors, cost, whether any of it can be covered by health insurance etc
</p>

I have read in the past that there may be a way to claim some of it on health insurance. It all has to do with your medical professional stating that it isn‚Äôt for ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù reasons, rather it is for mental health reasons, and then using the same Medicare numbers that are given to mastectomy patients when they get implants.

Yeah, im thinkin of tryin to get my dr to work it to get an augmentation as &#34;medically necessary&#34;(my health fund has some cover for that reason). Not sure if its known but i remember hearing a few years ago a woman in the ADF got a set of implants for free coz of self esteem issues, i might try and work that angle.

Dr Merten at Pure Aesthetics in Sydney (Macquarie St and Macquarie Uni Hospital) specialises in transgenders.   Transgender surgery is a quite different procedure to CIS surgery if you want a good result. He will give a cost estimation. About $10k or a little less. I‚Äôve seen him, explains things well and no rush.  Photos of results on website.  Looks good to me. üëç
