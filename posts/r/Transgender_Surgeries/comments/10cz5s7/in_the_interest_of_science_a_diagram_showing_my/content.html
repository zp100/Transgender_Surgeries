Are you dilating with a narrower dilator youâ€™re not showing, because itâ€™s unusual to increase depth like this otherwise.
</p>
<p>
How long are you post op?

I am using the Vaginal Dilators by soulsource (see link) and chose the same colours for the lines in the diagram. My surgery was on November 23rd and I started dilating one week after that. My surgeon recommended, that I dilate three times a day, for the first year (which I plan to do) and my goal was to increase depth and diameter as much as possible. The method was penile inversion with reuse of urethra and scrotal skin.
</p>
<p>
When dilating, I try to get to the depth I was the session before and then holding at that point for 15min with additional pressure. This took quite some time, when I was upgrading diameter and was using multiple dilators. Keeping my hips and/or the dilator moving in a circular motion helps a lot too, as well as turning the dilator, when its all the way in.

Thank You for doing this and sharing it. It&#39;s one thing I worry about and there isn&#39;t much reliable information from the girls themselves. I wish the very best result for you.
