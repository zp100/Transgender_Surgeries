I am scheduled for a revision at the end of October. Overall I am exceptionally happy. The care I have gotten has been superb.

Thank you for sharing your experience!
</p>
<p>
Would you be willing to provide more detail about the operation? Were you going for a full depth vagina? Did you undergo an orchiectomy prior to the neo-vaginal surgery? Laser or electrolysis before hand? Any detail you could provide would be amazing.

Sure thing! I had an orchiectomy about a year before I had vaginoplasty. It was really the thing that solidified my desire for the surgery. I had my consultation later the same year and was soon on the schedule.
</p>
<p>
I had laser before I had surgery. I am sure I wasn’t perfectly clear, but so far, I have t had any issues.
</p>
<p>
I originally contemplated zero depth, but decided I needed to go for the whole thing. A standard penial inversion.
</p>
<p>
I ended up with 5 1/2” of depth.

It’s pretty easy. First you will talk to Ejay and he will explain all of the back end requirements like letters and things. Dr. Kim is really nice and will go into more details about the process. They are requiring hair removal, so if you haven’t started on that yet, start soon. That is the big thing that can hold you back.
</p>
<p>
If you are in the Twin Cities area and would like to talk about it in person, social distancing of course, I would be more than happy to get together. I can go into greater detail if my experience. Feel free to message me.
