Yes, and I‚Äôm very happy with the result. Much like his GCS aftercare, he recommends a lengthy amount of daily care (30 minutes per day massage to avoid capsular contracture). His method is trans-axillary, so the implants are placed through an incision via the armpits then filled. I recently had a 4 month checkup with my GP and he was very blown away with Dr Chettawut‚Äôs work. His recommendation for the volume of the augmentation after assessing my measurements at the pre-surgery consultation has left a very natural looking result.

Did he used the endoscopic camera during the pocket dissection? It seems that a lot of surgeon are using it now for more accurate cutting and reduce bleeding. What implants did you get? The new Motiva? How are the scars getting?  Sorry if I asked to much cuz I can&#39;t find much info.

I wish I could answer all your questions. I‚Äôm not sure about the use of a camera. The accurate cutting rings true by the reaction of my GP and the awe at the quality and what he considered quick healing of the incisions. The implants were textured, beige to brown in colour but I couldn‚Äôt tell you a manufacturer. There is still some slight discolouration at the scars after 5 months, but barely noticeable by touch. For the implant volume, he measured everything (height, depth, nipple to nipple distance, possibly more) at the consult. And as you may have read regarding his other procedures, he is just the most lovely and caring person to put your trust in.

Haha, I noticed that you have your surgeries in September. I was in Bangkok too. I went to him in early October for SRS but didn&#39;t ask much details about the implants at that time. Should have asked him more face to face. Brown ones should be the the round Mentor implant, i supposed. How long were your incisions? Did he gave any meds for scar healing? Do you have the blood drains too? Where did he put them?

The incisions look to be around 1.5 inches and I did have drains which I thought were out of the incisions. The drains were removed before I left the clinic. Meds is a hard question too as I had FFS, BA and GCS in the one visit and had what seemed like a meal replacement plan worth of multiple antibiotics and other pills but I‚Äôm unsure what was related to each procedure. I wish I had better information for you, but unfortunately I was a bundle of nerves at the initial consultation and quite out of it for the time I was recovering in the clinic.

May I know what size did you go for? Did you buy the surgery bra from the doctor or you just use your own sports bra? Some doctors require patients to wear breast wrap for some time to avoid the implant movement, especially for armpit incision. Do you have that to?

I think it was 415cc implants as recommended after measuring at the consultation by Dr Chettawut. For reference I am 5‚Äô7‚Äô‚Äô and quite wide at the shoulders and 27 BMI. I totally left the volume decision to him and the result is aesthetically very pleasing. I brought my own bra from home (standard/plain with underwire) and the nurses assessed its fit as I was ready to leave the clinic and were pleased, but they offered the clinic bought bras if I needed of course. I had measured the bra to fit comfortably around my frame and allowed a D sized cup post-op which was luckily perfect.  There was no wrap as I remember, but daily massage started almost immediately to make sure the implants sat correctly plus to address capsular contraction risks.

Hi, just want to confirm with you. Hope you don&#39;t mind. üòÅ Another patient told me her scar under the breast crest was 3 inches for her 400+cc implants. So yours were only 1.5? Any complication moving your arms? Cuz I prefer the underarm method. But a lot of other clinic told me it would be 3++. üò≠

No problems... Just checked my partner to maker sure, appears 1.5 inches, perhaps &#34;definately 2 inches maximum&#34; under the armpits.  My GP explained the material is inserted first then the contents (fluid) added, thus the small incision. I had some muscle pain in one arm when it was raised above my shoulder height,  but I assumed it was due to the limited movement I usually had resulting in the surgeon needing to extended it past that point.

May I know how did you take care of your wound? Since the armpits are said to harbour a lot of bacteria. Did the doctor give any instruction?

Your GP probably mistaken that you have saline implant instead of silicone gel. Muscle pain at your arm or chest muscle? I&#39;m really worried about capsular contracture, especially because I&#39;m using injection.
