I have not had a great experience with bottom surgery, having now had three surgeries and still being in pain and with other complications. I&#39;m not yet sure I want to send pictures but I&#39;ll explain what happened. In 2020 I went to Dr. Meltzer in Arizona for the first stage of a two stage vaginoplasty. It went well. Then a year or two later I went for second stage, which was mostly labiaplasty. This is where the problems started. Meltzer mentioned adjusting my urethra during this surgery. Soon after surgery, my labia minora and clitoral hood retreated, despite doing exercises I was instructed to do, and an intense pain in my urethra started. This lasted a couple years before I could convince my parents to allow me to get a revision. We couldn&#39;t afford to go to Meltzer again, so I went to Dr. DeLeon at the Crane Center in Austin Texas. She did a revision surgery which was meant to remove excess erectile tissue around my urethra which they theorized was causing the pain, and also redo my labia minora and clitoral hood. She did indeed do those things, and said the excess erectile tissue was the most extensive she&#39;d ever seen. Yet, again, a couple weeks after surgery, my clitoral hood split in half, and my labia minora started retreating. That was a good 7-8 months ago. My labia minora are now completely gone, and my clitoral hood too. The pain has also come back despite the removal of the erectile tissue. It feels like a severe UTI most of the time and it comes and goes. In communication with Dr. DeLeon she continually dismissed my concerns, saying it would &#34;fix itself&#34; and yet it never did. On our final call (about three weeks ago I think), she finally admitted that it went wrong. She was extremely rude and would not admit any fault, only agreeing to waive part of her fee to revise my clitoral hood, but not the labia minora. My primary concern is appearance, but I really want to figure out what the pain is too. I&#39;ve been to urologists and gynecologists and nobody can figure it out. I need as much advice as can be given. This is probably my last chance for revision that my parents have agreed to pay for. We&#39;ve booked with the Crane Center, but I don&#39;t think I want to go back there. So I have around 4 months to find a better option. Im not sure what our cost limit is, but I just want to have results closest to a natal vagina as I can get, and as a bonus, if possible, a solution to the pain. So what surgeons have the best results, and best turnout for revision surgeries? This has been a rough three years for me, any help is appreciated.

It&#39;s not actually a UTI. It just feels like one. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s actually wrong.

Did your urologist say what the issue may be?

It may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
may be more.
