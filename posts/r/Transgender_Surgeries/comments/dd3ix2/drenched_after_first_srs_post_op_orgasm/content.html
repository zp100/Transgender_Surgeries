How did you heal so fast?? Any tips? It’s one of my big fears that it’ll take forever.

I was also able to have my first orgasm around 5 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Being in good shape before surgery, eating a lot of protein and an otherwise balanced diet. Lots of sleep, and as little &#34;more than necessary&#34; stuff, all help with healing.
</p>
<p>
But above all, a lot of luck. Every surgeon is different, as is every patient, and what works well for one, might not work well for the next.
</p>
<p>
Not having too high expectiations, like, I should be able to orgasm at 5 weeks, also helps.

I was gonna say the same. I live in a walkable neighbourhood and walked around 5 km a day (sometimes up to 10) as a part of my regular lifestyle. I eat super well and generally take good care of myself.
</p>
<p>
Those things helped, but Ive also been lucky.
</p>
<p>
Also, just saying, I was fucking dented for the first couple weeks too. Like in tons of pain when I walked, was only able stand for a minute or two.
</p>
<p>
I will also say that my impression is that brassard runs things kinda like bootcamp compared to other surgeons. By the third day, we served ourselves our meals from a buffet, were expected to fill up our ice bags ourselves, change our dressings ourselves and generally be as independent as physically possible. I’ve heard of other surgeons not even having their patients walk for 5 or 6 days post op (we were expected to walk the night of our surgery). Having to do that stuff while in a ton of pain, hardly able to move and being extremely exhausted was pretty rough, but i think it was probably ultimately quite helpful .

Damn! What was that famous line in that movie “When Harry Met Sally” with the restaurant scene..... “I’ll have what she’s having”.
