Heyyy everyone today marks 3 weeks since I had my Srs! I was wondering when did u start to feel normal like you were able to walk work and do normal everyday life things again! Also when did u stop having discharge that smelt like death üò≠üò≠ I would love to wear shorts without bleeding and discharging all through it! And when did sleeping on your side begin to feel normal again

Yessss that doesn‚Äôt seem to long for me to wait! üò≠ I‚Äôm a week away from hitting a month and 5 weeks away from two months ( although everyone heals differently) I‚Äôm waiting on this so I can also wear clothes with getting discharge or blood or pain from wearing shorts or jeans or anything

It&#39;s isn&#39;t that long, it&#39;s the mental game that makes it feel longer. I had one or two breakdowns over how helpless I felt and needing help.
</p>
<p>
But I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re using now, but my discharge and bleeding was pretty bad for a while so I used like the heavy maxi overnight pads. They were enough to let me actually put clothes on. Couldn&#39;t wear jeans because I like slim fit, but made leggings work. So if you&#39;re only using thin liners try getting something a little more capable.

I‚Äôm almost on the 3 months and i still have sone yellow discharge, but she don‚Äôt have smell anymore, if your surgeon its close to you i suggest u to ask if the smell its normal, mine was a little infection and like my surgery was in Thailand i had to find a doctor by here , so the gynecologist give me some metronidazole and the smell disappeared.... for sleep on the side i think you can start with a pillow on the middle of the legs, i started with 3 weeks too...jeans only after 3 months ...

Yeah same I can tell mines are slowly healing because it‚Äôs starting to turn pink and look more like healed skin rather than the red skin ( which I still have some )

Yesss it‚Äôs just yellowish whiteish discharge! Nothing greenish or darkish discharge heyyy so maybe I‚Äôm okky then and it could possibly be I douche with warm water and baby soap and that helps I also wear my spouses boxers ( size xl ) since my underwear well boy shorts  are a tad bit tighter you know and omg the struggle to sleeping on my side comfortably is hard and my spouse loves to cuddle sleeping side by side but it sometimes gets uncomfortable so I‚Äôm looking forward to being normal again

Walking, as soon as the packing came out, strength limited at first, maybe sometime end of second into third week more or less normal. Most everyday things I was doing at day 12-13 when I got home. But that said time was limited because of dilation. For work I was in the gym to get my strength back at week four and went back to work at full duty at nine weeks as planned. The discharge thing was somewhat complicated for me. At my four week follow-up I found out I had significant necrosis of the vaginal graph. That resulted in it taking about six months in to fully heal during which I had discharge for about five of those months. But the worst of it was in the first two months. As to sleeping in my side I was doing that in the hospital. I just kept a pillow between my legs. The pillow use lasted maybe three weeks.

that sounds soooo like soooo much! I don‚Äôt go back to work until July 14 which is my 3 months post op officially ( which I‚Äôll still be dilating I believe 3x a day ) or I‚Äôll be able to discuss this with my surgeon I‚Äôm still using the purple ( 5th dot with ease ) &amp; blue ( 5th dot with some relaxation) so hopefully at month 3 I‚Äôm normal again without all that discharge and smelly weird stuff ( I douche with warm water &amp; baby soap ) ughh I hope I‚Äôm normal before my birthday on July 4th üò≠
