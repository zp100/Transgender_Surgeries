I&#39;ve been intending to write an update for quite some time now since quite a bit has happened in the last 8 months and my 6 month update (index post
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e6jqjg/vaginoplasty_with_dr_krakowsky_and_dr_grober_at/">here</a>
). I think this will be my final update in this series since I&#39;ll be going under for a pretty comprehensive revision with Dr. Satterwhite in 2 days.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in a much better mental place since my hormones are under control and the antidepressants work. That and having a concrete course of action (which started to come together in June) have done wonders for my mental well being.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned in my 6 month update, I reached out to Dr. Wittenberg and had a video consult with her in June, it was a very positive consult and gave me a lot of hope that my problems could be addressed. I liked her manner and, while I still wanted to wait until I saw Dr. Krakowsky in person for my &#34;6 month&#34; follow up, I was planning on going with her for revision. I had a bunch of follow-up questions for her and we scheduled an in-person consult for August.
</p>
<p>
WCH opened back up for in person appointments in July and I had my somewhat delayed follow up at the 8-month mark. It was somewhat disappointing as I was told that the only parts they could address were the split clitoral hood and clitoris size. Which would be more than nothing, but wouldn&#39;t do anything to resolve many of my problems. If I hadn&#39;t already been expecting not great news, that would have hurt to hear but, having consulted with Dr. Wittenberg in June, I already had a plan in place.
</p>
<p>
I had my in-person consult with Dr. Wittenberg in August, in which she told me that while she could address _most_ of the complications she was extremely reluctant to try to reposition my clitoris due to risk of nerve damage, and that she couldn&#39;t address my lack of a right labia majora since she isn&#39;t setup to do fat transfer. She recommended that I get in touch with Dr. Satterwhite since he should be able to address that particular point. It was a bit of mental whiplash going from feeling very positive about going through revision with her to trying to figure out how to address everything again.
</p>
<p>
As she suggested, I consulted with Drs  Satterwhite and McGinn, both of whom are able to do fat transfer. I found that I was both more comfortable with Dr. Satterwhite and that he seemed to be much more on the same page as me with both what was wrong and how to fix it. Queue OHIP paperwork for out of country approval and I ended up with a surgery date of February 5th.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in San Fran now, having had my in person pre-op yesterday, and I&#39;m feeling confident that we&#39;re on the same page in terms of problems, goals, and approach to take. He both knows how to listen and is open to alternate approaches. My friend is flying in tomorrow to stay with me while I&#39;m recovering and I&#39;ve picked up all my prescriptions so I&#39;m about as ready as I can be short of being at the surgery centre. Fingers crossed.

Congratulations! I had my bottom surgery with Dr. Satterwhite&#39;s partner, Dr. Grujal. They are both wonderful surgeons and people. You are in great hands.
</p>
<p>
Are you going to get hyperbaric therapy after your surgery? I did and I think it really helped me heal faster.
</p>
<p>
By the way, I&#39;m going back to Dr. Grujal for FFS in March.

Thanks! I&#39;d say he&#39;s in my top 3 of surgeons who I feel really comfortable around. (The other 2 being Dr. Thomas who did my VFS, and the craniofacial surgeon who pulled the infected plate out of my chin and I&#39;m discussing a revision to my forehead with.)
</p>
<p>
I am, from what I&#39;ve heard it really helps with healing and reduces swelling which is a definite positive since I can&#39;t use ice because I&#39;m having some fat transfer done to my majora. I&#39;ve got a couple of books that I&#39;ve been meaning to read for a while to keep me company while I&#39;m in the chamber. :)
</p>
<p>
Nice! I hope you have a smooth recovery. :)

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
By the way, you may also get a wound vac. I had one and it reduces swelling a lot.
</p>
<p>
Good luck and have a fast recovery!

You&#39;re welcome!
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, one isn&#39;t planned for me. I suppose the difference between a primary procedure and a revision; there&#39;s a lot less major re-arrangement of things and less potential for loss of graft perhaps?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!
