So I made a post a while back asking about Dr. Tue Dinh for GRS and I wanted to write about the consult I had in person with Dr. Dinh because there is very little information about him at the moment, especially for all you local Houstonians out there!
</p>
<p>
My consult was early in the morning so I drove to downtown Houston at Methodist Hospital at Scurlock Tower all the way up the top floor, which is where his office is located. His office is beautiful when walking into the reception area and was giving me some sense of excitement to be able to meet with him. Upon arrival I checked in with the front desk and waited until I was called back in. The nurse assistant, Stephanie (the person who replaced Linda Snead for anyone whoâ€™s gone to Dr. Dinh in the past), was super sweet and welcoming. She took me to a room and had went over my medical history with me to double check some things and have everything ready and in order. Later, Dr. Dinh arrived in the room and he was giving off very cheerful, nice, sweet and caring vibes; which made me feel good!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Dinh told me he wanted to use the consult as an opportunity to give me a variety of options and some of the things we talked about in the consult:
</p>
<p>
So the golden question: How many SRS procedures does he do? He does 15 a year, only of those 15 he does 7 to 8 PI and the rest colon Vaginoplasty (which immediately did not sit well with me). He strongly prefers colon because he said to me that there are an amazing team of colon specialist at Houston Methodists that use a robot to extract the colon to use for the vaginal canal lining and he said he has very little complications with the colon vaginoplasty. Where I started to see problems was when he examined me to see if I was a good candidate for Penial Inversion, and he said I wasnâ€™t because unless I was looking for longer depth around 5-6 inches, my Penial skin was not enough to create a sufficient vagina. At max would be at 3.5 inches if Iâ€™m lucky according to him, and then we would have to take skin grafts from other places which I was opposed too. What was interesting was when I consulted Dr. DeLeon from Crane Center, she said that she would have no problem getting me the depth I want when the material I presented when I showed her, which might contribute to Dr. Dinh doing very little PI procedures per year, which kind of shows vs Dr. DeLeon doing PI 3 times per week. Even Dr. Freet does more than Dr. Dinh and I didnâ€™t have a great experience with Dr. Freet myself let alone have a high frequency of Vaginoplasty patients in comparison to other surgeons Iâ€™ve consulted.
</p>
<p>
After advising that I may not have the depth needed for PI, Dr. Dinh strongly advised me to do the colon Vaginoplasty. He works with a colon surgeon and said that I would first have to go through a colonoscopy to see if the colon is good and sufficient for the surgery. I was not a fan of having to come in another time just to do a colonoscopy for procedure I didnâ€™t want to do in the first place. He said that colon Vaginoplasty would not only give me the depth I want but itâ€™s long term affects were solid after the intense first year of dealing with the smell and constant discharges that would happen after the surgery and the recovery going forward in the first year. You would not have to go through with hair removal if you do this procedure he says. All of this just didnâ€™t sit well with me and so I asked him if he does ppt or peritoneal flap vaginoplasty and he said he didnâ€™t and heâ€™s felt that the peritoneal flap was going to cause more complications than any other procedure (which is true if you donâ€™t have the right team for it, Dr. Jun and Dr. BBL are examples of surgeons that perform that procedure the best!).
</p>
<p>
After that, we talked some more about my options, I asked a lot of questions and he was very patient and kind with me throughout the whole process. At the end, I asked to see some photos of his work and sadly, that didnâ€™t go well as he wasnâ€™t able to get consent from his patients to show photos and was only able to show me one photo of his that was not very aesthetically pleasing in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I think heâ€™s a really nice guy! Heâ€™s been actually known to do more GRS revisions than the actual procedures themselves but my big take away for you Houstonians out there is that I personally donâ€™t think he is someone I would recommend for doing Vaginoplasty unless heâ€™s your only ONLY option or you would not mind doing colon Vaginoplasty. Iâ€™ve had better experience with Crane Center and NYU Langone and might choose someone from either of those facilities. Experience and high frequency is VERY IMPORTANT! If there is a long ass waitlist, there is a reason why and they are worth the wait/fight and your really only get one shot to do this right (revision are not fun ðŸ˜¨)! And for me, doing only 15 per year plus some of the information I gained from him was not sitting well with even though he was giving his honest opinions and best of his experience as he could, which I highly respect!
</p>
<p>
I hope this is helpful to anyone in Texas looking for GRS surgeons!
