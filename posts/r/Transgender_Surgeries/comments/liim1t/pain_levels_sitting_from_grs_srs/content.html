Congratulations on your surgery!
</p>
<p>
I am a couple of days past 3 months. I had difficulty sitting for any length of time for week. Once I had the packing, wound vac and catheter removed, I found sitting with a doughnut not too bad for shorter periods, less than an hour. This gradually improved and by six weeks, I could sit a long time, 3 or 4 hours with the doughnut. By 8 weeks I was mostly sitting without it and not at 3 months, I can sit as long as I want with little or no discomfort.

I&#39;m almost 12-weeks and can sit quite happily for 2hrs in an office chair.
</p>
<p>
Moving from towels to liners made things more comfortable too. X

I could do that at 10-weeks - when I returned to work, and I had issues with some severe granulation that delayed my healing. X

I&#39;m 5 weeks out. I can sit for about a half hour to an hour without major discomfort. If I take Tylenol, I can sit through a full length movie. Donut pillow or not. I discovered my limit is around 2 hours per day, then she gets angry with me. Doc said it will likely be that way for the next couple of weeks. It gets better daily. Congrats on your surgery. :) Happy healing.

Hey there,
</p>
<p>
I too had surgery with Bluebond / Zhao about two and half weeks ago, so weâ€™re on a very similar timeline.
</p>
<p>
As of right now, I can sit for about 20 minutes on the waffle pad before it gets to be a bit much. But if I can slouch sit, such that Iâ€™m sitting more on my tailbone, itâ€™s a lot more comfortable, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing most of the time when Iâ€™m in an Uber or sitting in a waiting room. Iâ€™m sure my posture looks awful but I donâ€™t care.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to DM if you want to compare notes as we go through recovery together. At least for me, my recovery is going extremely well - I hope yours is too.
</p>

Almost 1 month after.  Sitting depends on the thing I&#39;m sitting on.  I have a lounge chair and I can sit quite a while on it without much discomfort.  The kitchen chair is padded but I need to sit all the way back for it to be comfortable.  I&#39;m working at home now so my desk chair I have a very fluffy pillow that helps.  I need to shift every so often on it.

my friend of mine had a GRS operation in Thailand with Dr. Kanit, I asked about this experience.
</p>
<p>
on the first month, he will be sitting on a donut-like pillow, It will help to sit longer for him.
</p>
<p>
Everything for him is perfect. Wish you good luck too
