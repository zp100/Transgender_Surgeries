Yes, it was. Really liked the level of care I got from the surgical team and nurses who cared for me while I was staying in the hospital

That&#39;s so great to hear it really helps with my anxiety! I&#39;ve been trying to find more info on him so I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking but I have a few questions:
</p>
<p>
1)how long was the waitlist for surgery for you? &amp; 2)how many appointments did you have before your actual surgery &amp; 3/4)was electrolysis hair removal a requirement for the ppt method? If so how much did you have to get done?
</p>
<p>
Btw your results are looking amazing!!!

1) roughly 6 months 2) I had three appointments before the surgery. Two with Flannery and one with Gupta 3/4) not required but strongly recommended. I had the shaft of the penis, a bit less than an inch radius around the shaft, and the scrotum cleared of hair. Took about 9 months to do (this will very based on how dense your hair is)
</p>
<p>
Thank you!

Question for the both of you, how does the insurance process go, like I’m on the east coast and I’ve never dealt with out of network.

Dr. Gupta was in network for me so my insurance and U.H.&#39;s insurance department handled it. I do not know what changes for out of network cases

No original asker but I am also seeing Gupta for ppt vaginoplasty so I was curious was the hair removal on the scrotum to remove any area from closely around your opening? I’m considering starting that area too (I’m only a month and a half into my electrolysis so I can add it no problem.)

I don&#39;t have the medical expertise to answer that. Possibly? I just did what Dr. Gupta said would provide the best odds for a successful recovery and outcome

Ok so the scrotum was at his recommendation. If that’s the case I will absolutely start getting that done.

I&#39;m doing Dr Fascelli at the cleaveland clinic.  I had my consultation in October and am just waiting for insurance approval.  Hopefully before Christmas.  He is replacing Dr. Ferrando and has trained under a lot of different Dr over the last 3 years and he showed me the end results I can expect from great to ok. He is LGBTQIA+also and he made me feel so at ease and I can&#39;t wait to share my experience also.
<br>
Congratulations on your beautiful outcome ❤️

Was this at the pride center? Is that what it&#39;s called? I&#39;ve heard my friend who lives in Youngstown area talking about another place she is threatening about switching to from The C/C. She&#39;s doing her hormones through there and I&#39;m not. I&#39;m from Missouri and I had to go telemedicine through TransClinique a couple of years ago and I ended up with a family of friends there and am sticking with them. The cleaveland clinic is where I am having surgery and I actually just flew home a couple of days ago and I don&#39;t really no that much about there. She just said that there was a pride clinic hospital that does surgery there also.

The pride clinic is located in Lakewood, Ohio. It&#39;s a Cleveland clinic hospital. I go to them for my hrt and my primary care physician.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if University hospitals has a specific pride clinic. I just went to them for Gupta because he did PPT

The new Dr that&#39;s doing me at the cleaveland clinic Dr. Fascelli is doing PPV on me. That&#39;s what he has interned doing for 3yr. He is also going to take a small skin graph from my R upper thigh so I can have superb depth plus he said it will buy me two more days stay in the hospital to cut back on the $2300. Campus hotel that&#39;s out of pocket and mandatory.
</p>
<p>
My girlfriend hormone Dr was Dr. Kinsey which had to retire for health issues I believe she told me. I was just at the cleaveland clinic main Tuesday before Thanksgiving.  I hope I can get results like you.  I have confidence that I will.  I am always a positive thinker.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had to semi move to Ohio to get insurance coverage.  My governor here in Missouri pass law banning any Trans surgeries paid for by state insurance no matter what on August 28th.  A little over a month before my consultation that had been scheduled since July and I have been years getting this far and I lose my coverage at the last minute. And now they are screwing around and won&#39;t cancel me so I can get Ohio and on the financial aid program at the clinic.  I was supposed to have had my surgery now the week after Thanksgiving but it&#39;s taken 30days to get MO canceled and they have screwed that up and I had to call again yesterday to confirm I was canceled and I wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s one thing after another for me but I just have to ride it out, I no I will be getting it shortly it&#39;s just this not knowing exactly when is tuff. At least the Dr has promised me an open spot within a week after I get approval.

I’m pretty recently accepting myself and one of the first thing I was pretty sure I needed was srs. I was living so hard trying to over masculine everything but sex is weird you can’t fake you all the time. Girl, if your up front with guys about depth they’ll probably get of faster. Beautiful results btw and in a year or two I hope to be joining you with my own vagina lol

Would love to hear a 13mo assessment! I am following the same path as you did, with the same surgical team so any opinions, tips, issues you&#39;ve had or even milestones would be amazing and much appreciated sis!

Hi! Took a break from Reddit so just getting to these now.
</p>
<p>
Self advocacy is important. The team means well but they aren&#39;t in your body. I wish I had brought up more of my small worries as they were happing instead of waiting.
</p>
<p>
Highly recommend getting them to recommend you to a pelvic floor specialist if you can afford it. Around/after the time you&#39;re cleared for sex. I waited until I felt like I could never have penetrative sex just to find out all I need is some physical therapy. Would have been easier if I started that sooner.
</p>
<p>
There a lot of lubes out there. My PT recommended switching to &#34;good clean love - bionude.&#34; It&#39;s a bit pricey but I like it.
</p>
<p>
Gained about 20 lbs during the first year. Not really a vaginal thing but that was tough some days. I&#39;m sure I could lose it if I tried. Just have been busy as hell.
</p>
<p>
Cis-Men didn&#39;t necessarily get &#34;more attractive&#34; but I lost a lot of dysphoria about having sex with them. So that&#39;s a win for my bisexuality.
</p>
<p>
Um, yeah. Kinda rambled. Any thing in specific?
</p>

You need to be dilating a lot more aggressively.  At least 2 hrs and 3 times a day.

That&#39;s really not much more than I dilate already. It&#39;s also not really feasible to dilate in the middle of the day.

Yes it is is a huge difference. You are warming up the tissue the first hour it needs to be done for longer duration.  Id recommend going to a pelvic floor specialist  and see what they have to say.  You need to make time for this it doesn’t have to be middle of the day. That is why GCS is such a big thing you need to dilate to maintain depth.  You’ve already lost depth so that should tell you it isnt enough

Thank you so much for sharing! I have struggled to find others who are going to Gupta and have talked about their experiences at all.

It’s extremely helpful to hear your experience and see your results. Thank you again! The lack of information I was finding was making me a bit nervous honestly.

That&#39;s totally fair. I was definitely a bit nervous going into it. While I did have a good recovery, I would like to say that I am just one data point. It is very possible that others have had better or worse experiences. I wish you the best of luck
