Hey all!
</p>
<p>
I had a vaginoplasty about 15 months ago with Dr. Ting.
</p>
<p>
Ostensibly, everything has gone well. Cosmetically and functionally everything is adequate, but the feeling of intense pain has never gone away. It doesn’t feel like it did right after surgery, but it’s felt like intense bruising ever since initial recovery.
</p>
<p>
Family doctor is at a loss. Surgeon has no idea. I go to pelvic physio regularly and I’ve worked through vaginismus, but things are still so painful it’s debilitating.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea who to turn to or what to do next, so figured I’d ask here: has anyone experienced this? Was there anything that helped? Any sort of specialist or an idea of what to check? I’m desperate and have no idea what to do next.
</p>

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through this. I can&#39;t say I feel anything comparable at 6 months post op. If you have constant pain I&#39;m not even sure what that could be other than nerve damage.

Where is the pain centered at? Is it diffuse the whole vulva, the vagina, clitoris? Is is just one area?  Is it constant or does it come and go?  How would you characterize the sensation? Does anything make it better, what makes it worse?

Have near constant pain going on 6 years post. Especially if I mess with the clit. Feels like a fishhook is caught on it.

It may be a good idea to discuss things with a neurologist. It sounds like scar tissue and issues with nerves.
</p>
<p>
And some people use organic coconut oil for dilation etc.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/transfeminine/index#wiki_after_surgery" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
in the middle it was discussed. It may penetrate deep into the tissue and may make for a softening. Its what a number of people from Thailand recommend.
</p>
<p>
Hope you find a few ways that work for you.

Yes, I have had 2 revisions and have been using coconut oil for many years.  I have had 100&#39;s of inflamed and ingrown hairs in the clitoral hooding area that prevents any &#34;using&#34; it.  It makes the pain worse. I&#39;m done having operations below. I&#39;m still glad the birth defect has been sorted. Sad about the pain. Last ditch a pelvic floor person but I have no issues with dilation. depth or trouble and use Mr. Orange.

There is a pathology called “chronic post surgical pain” which can happen. I don’t know much about it, however other that some casual reading when I was post op. It’s usually managed with gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and other neuro modulation medications. If you’re still having pain, you might ask to see a pain specialist.

A bit off topic, but you
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/m7zu4i/4_months_post_op_cant_orgasm/" rel="nofollow">posted a year ago</a>
that you can&#39;t orgasm. How did that go?
