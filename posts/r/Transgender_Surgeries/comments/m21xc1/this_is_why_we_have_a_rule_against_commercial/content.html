Rule 6

Rule 6 was added to this sub about a year ago to protect members of our community against unfair commercial influence by surgeons.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>
6.
</strong>
Posts by people with a commercial interest in members decisions. Please follow
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/">these rules</a>
. You will be assigned a light yellow flair next to your user name.
</p>

<p>
We have surgeons and their representatives who post in this sub, all of whom follow
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/">rule 6</a>
, don&#39;t advertise and have a flair identifying themselves as having a commercial interest. Some of their comments have been very helpful.
</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;ve been reluctant to do this but I feel the need to speak up about some activity I&#39;m seeing here on reddit promoting Thai surgeon Dr Kamol Pansritum. We&#39;re having life changing surgeries based on what we read here.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year there were posts by
<a href="/u/Kamol-Hospital">u/Kamol-Hospital</a>
directly advertising Dr Kamol. I gave them the usual notification regarding rule 6 and removed their post, and they did it again.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ktrmed/ffs_suggestion_what_you_recommend_for_more/gistqst/">I removed that too</a>
. They gave up.
</p>
<p>
Then some time later along comes new user
<a href="/u/ChrissyJ1978">u/ChrissyJ1978</a>
who starts posting glowing reports about Dr Kamol. After seeing a few of these (ie 15 out of 15 posts promoting Dr Kamol)
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/l1ug5m/understanding_surgery_in_thailand/glw9w2o/">I finally said something</a>
. She&#39;s posted about 90 times now, almost every one of which is about Dr Kamol.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after this warning another reddit account pops up,
<a href="/u/transwoman42">u/transwoman42</a>
, to say good things about Dr Kamol and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/l5log2/transgender_surgeries_inquiry/glzmytw/?context=3">supporting ChrissyJ1978&#39;s</a>
comments - and she had PPV last year
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I agree chrissyj1978 i went to the Kamol hospital for my PPV last year and they were amazing, I&#39;m so happy with the results. Dr Kamol is a legend and comes highly recommended
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Fair&#39;s fair, though ChrissyJ1978
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/lcgxlx/ppv_srs_and_ba_end_of_the_month_im_so_excited/glzs2t0/?context=3">posts</a>
supporting transwoman42.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I&#39;m so happy for you Transwoman42 and without sounding condescending very proud of you 35 years is a long time to live in denial and also very mentally frustrating as i can only imagine, good for you xx. I also have had experiences with the kamol hospital, dr.Kamol is very very good at what he does, your in very safe hands, have you been there before??. I wish you all the best in life, let us all know how it goes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This doesn&#39;t prove anything you might think, but both of them posted their photos, and they look remarkably, absolutely, identical. Here&#39;s
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/comments/ld4vkf/out_with_the_old_and_in_with_the_new/">transwoman42</a>
and here&#39;s
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/comments/ldtjjl/hi_all/">ChrissyJ1978</a>
</p>
<p>
After I banned them all she setup another sub
<a href="/r/TransgenderSurgeries">r/TransgenderSurgeries</a>
, and they are &#39;both&#39; mods.
</p>
<p>
She also
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransyTalk/comments/luwjcj/youtube_transgender_daily_surgery_vlog/">announced</a>
her YouTube channel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqwcwbO0PcZA_FTrA58KHdw">A Transgender Vlog, My Journey</a>
where you can hear more on this subject. There&#39;s also some Facebook groups, but I&#39;ve not looked at those.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve noticed a recent  up-tick of interest in Dr Kamol on reddit, so I believe this is having some influence. Hence this post. I&#39;d probably not have said anything otherwise, but I can&#39;t stand by and say nothing at this point.
</p>
<p>
I may post screen captures later if the links get deleted.

9 times out of 10 (maybe more) when I see someone comment regarding Kamol I&#39;m left with the impression that you&#39;ve taken the time to confirm. Their tone is just so remarkably different from any other I can&#39;t accept anything they say at face value. Just the worst kind of advertising I can imagine.
</p>
<p>
It
<em>
may
</em>
be that Kamol is just as skilled of a surgeon as Suporn or any other, but if so there are much better ways of advertising such a claim. The fact that they&#39;ve chosen such a poor method speaks volumes.

It&#39;s funny, because without reddit, I would have never heard of Kamol, but I&#39;ve heard of Suporn a number of times, both inside reddit and outside.  So it just sounds like an advertising thing.

Thank you for writing all this out and letting us know. This is even weirder then when Dr.Kanit was getting all those cryptic reviews that sounded mostly the same. The sneakiness of this as well as the blatant lying reflects really badly on Kamol.
</p>
<p>
All that Rule 6 really requires is transparency and a more valuable approach to letting us know what surgery with your clinic could be like. It’s a bit concerning that they didn’t wanna do that. It’s also concerning that the 2nd account transwoman42 in her first post says she’s
<em>
going
</em>
to be having PPV SRS but then in other posts says she had PPV SRS last year and is discussing her experiences. Like yes it’s a fake account but the fact that you’re contradicting yourself on the same account is...
</p>
<p>
Of course, Dr. Kamol may not be doing this himself but someone associated with him is and they want our business so badly that they’re willing to break rules, sneak around, and lie. They can’t even go about it honesty. This definitely adds to the risk of going to him in my opinion, and is something to consider if he’s on your list.

Hmmm thats a weird post as well. Tbh if I didn’t have this context I likely would have taken it with a grain of salt. It seems to be more about a concierge service? Also pelvic implants are not the same as SRS (which is what I’d go to him for) so I feel like it gives me more insight to how Kamol would react if something went wrong vs what he could do for me SRS wise.
</p>
<p>
With the added context of this situation though, it make things even more fishy. The Petersong association is shady and so is this. That’s not good and ups the risk more.

Agreed, such a major surgery requires that one has complete trust in the surgeon. Behaviour like this by his representatives does not encourage that

I know you&#39;ve taken your position/power as a mod very seriously with regard to not &#34;speaking out&#34; or possibly disparaging surgeons, even when it&#39;s clearly warranted. Mad respect for that, and I think this situation 100% warrants this post.

Thank you so much for being vigilant and informing us of this! Like, this is so shady, even at a quick glance I&#39;m just seeing how one day, ChrissyJ1978
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/comments/ld4vkf/out_with_the_old_and_in_with_the_new/gnzlbml/">claims to have undergone PPV SRS</a>
and then the very next day
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TransgenderSurgeries/comments/lo3grb/not_long_now/">has somehow reverted back???</a>
How?!

I&#39;m sorry but your comment has little to do with mine.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s not a real person, that she didn&#39;t get surgery at all, or that Dr. Kamol doesn&#39;t do good work. I couldn&#39;t possibly know any of that. (Going by the timeline of that second link, she very well did, latest at about 14 days ago, in which case I am really happy for her.)
</p>
<p>
None of this changes her shadiness though? Looks to me like there&#39;s a huge, huge inconsistency in the information shared in the first link versus what&#39;s in the post in the second link, that&#39;s all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>
I had the PPV SRS
</strong>
OMG its amazing much better than the colon/inversion techniques
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s 19 days ago.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Only 4 days now before i go to the Kamol hospital in Thailand to see Dr kamol for my surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Super excited, not really nervous just excited.
<strong>
I cant wait to wake up from surgery to know my penis has gone.
</strong>
YAY!!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That&#39;s a day later. Now, I can see a case for how there&#39;s no conflict here but that just seems terribly unlikely. Either outright lying or misleading it looks like to me, but who knows, perhaps I&#39;m missing something?

I’m not sure tbh! I’ve been trying to find a good surgeon for years! So far the only surgeon who seems to be consistent and affordable is Kamol. I would’ve went with Dr Selph in Birmingham if it wasn’t for the fact of there staff is shady and haywire and it seems they have a pick system of people they want to help. Its so hard trying to make the right decision! As soon as you think you’ve found the perfect surgeon then there’s a horrific post pop up about them. I’m almost to the point of giving up and just live life with what I got...

I&#39;m so sorry, it must be a really stressful thing to be deciding. Please have some hopefully comforting e-hugs from me! 🤗🤗🤗
</p>
<p>
If it helps, I don&#39;t think that Dr. Kamol being advertised shadily here necessarily implies bad things about his competency though. Could still be a good surgeon, just with an overly aggressive advertising team / fanbase who are just being rule-breakey here on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
If GRS is a life-saving or life-enhancing procedure for you, I do hope you won&#39;t give up! I was looking at Dr. Chett and I&#39;ve seen some disheartening bad reviews of him too. It&#39;s just important to be careful, do our best to research as much as we can, trying to keep an objective eye on all the relevant information, and weigh all the pros and cons against each other. Who to pick, what procedures to undergo, how much to spend, how much to wait and save and all.
</p>
<p>
I wish you all the best with finding the right surgeon and having the surgeries you want go well, and I wish you so much happiness and ease in your life.

I&#39;m sure she&#39;s real, the problem is all the deception. She has a YouTube channel. She also has (or had) a Facebook group where she offered a discount code for Dr Kamol, from which she no doubt some money.
</p>
<p>
Its worth considering that Dr Kamol has discount codes at all and what this implies. Who else is influenced by this? I&#39;ve never heard of any other surgeon doing this.

Is there something that can be done about them copying the name of an existing subreddit? I really have no clue but find it very disturbing and confusing.

No, but there’s also nothing stopping anyone posting links to this post wherever they post outside that sub.

Thanks for informing us. Christ, just when I was considering Kamol for a revision, along comes this post.

Thanks for getting the word out. Under-qualified surgeons bother me a lot. If you don&#39;t have them on your radar, please keep an eye out for Robert D Oates, MD posts as well.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Oates started with no experience or training in GRS when BCBS pushed to get a surgeon in MA after they got appealed into covering surgeries out of state.

It wouldn&#39;t be allowed, but its normally not possible to really know whats going on. It might be suspicious, but perhaps its real.
</p>
<p>
What usually happens is that other members will say something, and if you&#39;re researching the surgeon you&#39;ll have to decide for yourself.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t like making decisions for other people which is why I don&#39;t usually do anything.

If they wanted to go on and on about Dr Karol as a promotional tool, why can’t they just make a subreddit about him specifically? You can even add a link to it in the wiki and note it’s a commercial venture about Dr Karol. I’m glad you mentioned this, btw.

I did notice that those recent Kamol post seem fake. It’s ashamed that people are doing that because I’m sure Dr Kamol doesn’t need Reddit. He seems to be doing fine getting patients. I just noticed him in the news the other week with the human Ken/Barbie. I’m sure that will spike his business by itself.

Fairly sure this behaviour gets you banned from Reddit you should reach out to reddit.we had a similar issue with a troll on our dayz server of making new accounts to troll us .Reddit banned him in the end. Circumventing bans is a Reddit bannable offense.

Can we get list of subreddits to stay away from in the sidebar ?  We have &#34;Useful Subreddits&#34;, but nothing about bad actors.  Getting that visible might raise more awareness than a post that many people might miss?  Seems like it could be useful.

I thought about making a list of useful subs in the wiki, but ones to avoid would be an

While I disagree with them they are trans, so I’m not going there. I’ll add subs run by terfs, etc.

Is the criteria they have to meet just being trans moderated?  For example TrueTransChristianity was created by a ~15 year old trans man who uses the bible to call gay people sinners and call out blasphemy as he sees it because TransChristianianity was too accepting of other interpretations of the bible.
</p>
<p>
I would also suggest a warning for
<a href="/r/lesbians" rel="nofollow">r/lesbians</a>
and point people to actuallesbians instead due to terf harassment.

I would avoid doing this. This post is really worthwhile because it&#39;s your sub but I don&#39;t think you publicly  judging other subs is a good look. I know you have good intentions.
</p>
<p>
People need to take some personal responsibility when looking at subs and particularly if researching medical matters.

After research, I&#39;ve found Kamol clinic and write to their WhatsApp to some Spain representative (I&#39;m in Argentina btw). The YouTube videos are so fake, you don&#39;t wear a bikini and pose like nothing was done in that area 1 months after. There&#39;s too much irreality in their videos. Also no complains, no bad reviews.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve found that a patient has had SRS with them through some strange commercial dealings (production was made as for TV, like a movie), but with some political prearrangement that was aimed to promotion, not like a big brother but definitely they put so much effort in how much great it&#39;s going to their clinic. Videos are SURREAL.
</p>
<p>
It misleaded me to the point to think there&#39;s NO POST-OPERATIVE CARE AT ALL. That sounds misinformed and dangerous. That&#39;s why I avoided Kamol team at all costs.

Interesting, I&#39;ve seen this sub mentioned on other trans subs. It&#39;s well done and seemed genuine although I was a little suspicious....

These posts will certainly influence people in that it raises the visibility of this surgeon.
