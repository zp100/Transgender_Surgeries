I know Mittermiller trained under Keojampa, but I&#39;m trying to decide who would be best for me. Mittermiller is in-network and has significantly shorter wait times, while if I went with Keojampa I&#39;d have to pay about twice as much, being out of network, and put down a $5K deposit which will be rough.
</p>
<p>
There are photos of my face on my profile, I need really extensive work to even remotely pass with makeup and I&#39;m worried about Mittermiller not being as experienced if I were to go with him.

Him and his OR staff are top notch.

Oh, and the *life changing* results are nice, too.

You should go with whoever you feel most comfortable with.  I didnt like Keojampa bc his office staff completely sucks.  Despite calling and emailing multiple times, I was never able to get a call to schedule an appointment.  At the end of the day, I am only interested in doctors that I feel good inside with.  If all things were equal (insurance, wait times etc), which would you choose!?  Which one do you trust most?  Iâ€™d go w that one
