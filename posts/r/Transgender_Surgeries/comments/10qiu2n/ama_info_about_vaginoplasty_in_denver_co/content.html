Well put together list - I am sure this will be useful for many others in the Rocky Mountain region.  Full disclosure - I am having my surgery with Dr. K and Dr. H at UCHealth (May 12th!)
</p>
<p>
For the hair removal requirement, UCHealth also offers an &#39;in-house&#39; option.  They were without an electrologist for a few months, but they have hired a new one and she is wonderful (as well as being trans herself, which may make some feel more at ease).  You can request a referral from the ITP to the Dermatology department for this.  As of my last appointment there were a few openings, but these can go fast.  People who no-show too many times are removed from the list, so openings do happen periodically.  Plus, right now I would expect at least one other opening in the April timeframe since I will be done. ðŸ˜Š  The UCHealth Electrologist is also the only one in the state of Colorado currently accepting medicaid, so that may also be a benefit to many.
</p>
<p>
As far as the consultation goes, give them a call periodically to see if there are any cancellations you can take advantage of (and if you were setup with the UCHealth App, look at your currently scheduled appointments - once the consultation shows up, check the option to be notified if an earlier time comes available).  Back in late 2020 when I scheduled my consultation I believe it was around 6 months out.  I ended up getting a call back early January &#39;21 for an opening in February which I took.
</p>
<p>
Also, just for information - Dr. K trained with Rachel Bluebond-Langner and uses the same hybrid PIV/Peritoneal procedure with robotic assistance (Dr. H does the robotic/internal side).  I believe that Dr. Hyer at Denver Health trained with Marci Bowers, so I would imagine her technique would be similar to Bowers&#39;.
</p>
<p>
I am counting down the days as they fly by (and madly trying to get everything prepared that my OCD mind insists I do) until my surgery.  I fully intend to post updates and results afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes on your journey!  ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

Thank you so much! What a lovely comment, I&#39;m really glad to see into your experience with UC! I&#39;ll try reaching out to them to see if anything comes of it. I haven&#39;t spoken to them since joining their waitlist.
</p>
<p>
Very excited for you! Looking forward to hearing all your updates &lt;3

Hey I was looking at this because my first choice was dr bluebond-langner but her waiting list is crazy. (Just for a consult they said I&#39;d have to wait til 2025) so I was looking for others Dr Wittenberg is another big name in San Francisco but unfortunately they don&#39;t accept my insurance. So Dr K seems good since he studied with one of them, what&#39;s his full name if you don&#39;t mind or is it dr. khechoyan?

Hi there.  His name is Dr. Christodoulos Kaoutzanis.  You can look him up on the UC Health web site.

Yea, sorry I did a bit more research and pieced it together. I put in for a consult and would love to hear more about how the surgery pans out for you! Also if you don&#39;t mind how long did it take them to schedule a surgery for you after your consult?

My consult was in Feb &#39;21.  I got scheduled for surgery in July &#39;22, with my date being in 2 weeks.  Most of the time in between was dealing with hair removal, so if you haven&#39;t started that expect it to take anywhere from 10-24+ months - depending on your hair growth patterns and amount.

Hey everyone! I made a website with updates to this post. Over the next year, I intend to evolve it into a full-fledged resource. I am aware that the website is rough in its current state, but I figured I&#39;d prioritize publishing the information than sitting on it.
