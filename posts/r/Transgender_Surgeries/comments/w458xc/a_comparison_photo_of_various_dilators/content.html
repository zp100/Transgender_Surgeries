In my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/tfj6wx/guide_to_dilating/">Guide to dilating
</a>
post, I talk about the various Soul Source dilators and dilators you can get beyond Soul Source #4.  This is a comparison photo of those dilators which makes it very obvious the width/girth difference between where you start out and where you could get to.

<p>
In order from left to right:

<ul>
<li>
Soul Source GRS #P1 (9&#34; x 7/8&#34;)
</li>

Soul Source GRS #P2 (9&#34; x 1&#34;)
</li>
<li>
Soul Source GRS #1 (9&#34; x 1 1/8&#34;)
</li>
<li>
Soul Source GRS #2 (9&#34; x 1 2/8&#34;)
</li>
<li>
Soul Source GRS #3 (9&#34; x 1 3/8&#34;)
</li>
<li>
Soul Source GRS #4 (9&#34; x 1 4/8&#34;)
</li>
<li>
Soul Source Silicone dilator #8 (6&#34; x 1 4/8&#34; =&gt; 1 5/8&#34;)
</li>
<li>
Luscious Playthings #7 Glass dilator (7&#34; x 1 6/8&#34;)

Thanks for posting this.
</p>
<p>
Luscious Playthings ones look good. #6 would be excellent for my needs, pity it&#39;s only 7&#34;. Only suitable one I&#39;ve found for sizing up from the Suporn Clinic Large is a custom one (additional length) from Passion Glass. Very expensive and a long delay in receiving it.
</p>
<p>
Onundon ones available on Amazon.de are long enough but 40mm diameter is too wide to start with and they don&#39;t ship to Australia anyway.
</p>
<p>
Some people say they use Soul Source orange but really prefer not to do dynamic dilation with that curved end.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;ve just read the FAQ and Luscious Playthings say they will do custom orders. I&#39;ll enquire about a longer one.
</p>
<p>
Onundun ones now ship to Australia. I bought a 40mm and a 45mm. Don&#39;t know why I bought the 45mm, don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever squeeze it in there. But it was relatively inexpensive. The 40mm almost split me in half! Was really hard to insert because of the blunt end. Didn&#39;t try pushing it to my full depth, think I may have done some damage trying that. They are very clear and smooth and super heavy.

I’ve been using the SS #8 (silicone) one for quite a while. Honestly unless you are a size queen or are in to fisting it’s more than enough. Even my surgeon said the orange (#4) would be optional in 99% of things you might put in there.

The average girth of a penis is a little under the width of orange, but talking about all sizes you will find out there some will be thinner and some will be thicker than orange.  So for most reaching orange is good enough.  Happily gaining width is *way* easier than gaining depth.
</p>
<p>
My partner was wider than orange so I knew from the start I would need to find some sort of dilators larger than orange to make sex comfortable.

I always wonder if there is any &#34;give&#34; in an actual penis, which makes the orange one even &#34;larger&#34; in comparison.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t know about you gals, but the hardest part for me is how hard the dilators are. The unyielding plastic is definitely tough to work with.

I was able to get to progress from one to the next reaching full depth (a little over 7&#34;) on them all.  I forget exactly when, but I was regularly dilating with Mystic before I reached 6 months post-op.   I did try out a handful of other dilators too, but these were my recommendations.
</p>
<p>
Sizing up through the Mystic Large most will start running into a need to stretch beyond the vaginal entrance ring.  You will have to start stretching urethra tissue and labia minora tissue so I would have a hard time recommending anyone going beyond 2 1/4&#34; in width (based upon measurements mentioned in most surgical papers I read).  Being fisted is something else, but probably not worth the extra effort and risks of stretching this other delicate tissue.
</p>
<p>
While I didn&#39;t get it, as mentioned in my post the medium Mystic is a good one for immediately after orange and at its max width is smaller than the Mystic Large.  Comfortable because it is squishy and helps you size up via the fact it is tapered.  The glass of course is best for long-term dilating because it is completely ridged and guarantees you are reaching your full depth/width.

Thank you for this! I feel like a fish out of water when it comes to sizing up after orange. I’m currently afraid of going past like a 5.2in circumference because I don’t want to hurt myself/rip. I don’t  know what my natural “limit” is width wise and I don’t what size I should be at to accommodate the vast majority of men.

The average size for men is probably between the Soul Source #2 and #3. You’ll see higher numbers if you look at most studies because men are only asked to disclose and they often exaggerate both length and girth. But some men can be larger than the orange by a bit, and a small few larger than that.

Thank you so so much. Orange isn&#39;t enough for me.
