I had some from brassard as well.

<p>
Fortunately after a few months it will close on its own.   Keep her clean and dry as best you can.   Dilation and douching will get much easier when those wounds clean up.

I forgot to mention, make sure you use lots of lube around the cavity entrance while the dehiscence heals on dilation, it will help keep the dilator from pulling on the stitches.

I had a dehiscense also.  Yours isn&#39;t that bad.   It is a very common almost expected complication.  Keep dilating,  keep area very clean, follow your surgeon&#39;s instructions.   It will heal and usually very well.  I know you feel devastated,  I did also. Look on the bright side you have a vagina!! Glass half full instead of half empty kind of thing. Here is love ❤️  and hugs through the  cloud .  Recovery really is difficult from mtf vaginoplasty .  Charlie

I had dehiscence as well, and my surgery was with Dr. Laungani (same hospital). It sucks, it’s very very very scary. But it heals, just takes a very long time. What everyone else applies, but remember your mental health too. The process is very taxing.

Bring a battery pack or a very long charging cable, the wall outlets are very far from the bed.
</p>
<p>
And don&#39;t wait to say if you&#39;re cold, i spent several days freezing until i told them and turns out they had space heaters available all along
</p>
<p>
I unfortunately can&#39;t say much about the place, i was intolerant to all the antibiotics they had so i spent most of my time with heavy nausea and headaches
