It&#39;s healing well. Clitoris has feeling. Canal is good. But there is no getting away from granulation which gets burned off. (I went with the PI with Peritoneal flap, if you were curious?)

Hey kati sorry to message a old post but you look amazing, I remember seeing your name before because I was looking up justine lee but you almost look completely different. Did you get another ffs done with someone else or just with justine lee? I am about to on the waiting list for justine lee after switching health insurance so I was looking her up again.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be rooting for your recovery and thank you so much for sharing your experiences, you are looking so beautiful and thats even without make up.

Thank you honey. You made my day. I had an ffs revision with Dr Paul MitterMiller.  With Dr. Lee, I had requested too much work for my first surgery. In hindsight I should have done it in stages. A few complications did occur which I had corrected with Dr. MitterMiller.. In hindsight, I would have gone with Dr. MitterMiller and done chin and jaw as a separate surgery then upper face after.

Ah, I didn&#39;t even know that was such a thing. I just always assumed one is supposed to get everything done in one go. If you don&#39;t mind, can you share what kind of complications occurred so I can be more educated on this topic?
</p>
<p>
You seriously look completely different I was surprised by the change, Dr.MitterMiller must be great.
</p>
<p>
With justine lee were you forced to only do the upper face with her because of said complications?  That must have been stressful, but whatever happened you are so beautiful your new surgeon did a amazing job like I said I only remembered your name and was so baffled with how different you looked haha and I&#39;m not trying to ham you up, thats you in the hospital with no make up LOL.

Haha. Yes. No make up.
</p>
<p>
With Dr Lee, I did pretty much everything below in one go. Chin, jaw, brow bone redux, rhino. Fat graft in lips and cheeks, hair line lowering, lip lift. (and Tracheal shave w/ Dr. Mendehlson). Honestly, it was too much and I should have separated it into two surgeries.
</p>
<p>
things that went wrong: permanent hair loss in the front left side. i need hair transplant, which unfortunately isn‚Äôt covered by insurance.  rhino was lacking and the chin shaping was very conservative and not centered, so i have a small indentation on one side of my face.  am considering a chin revision with Dr. Mittermiller. going in for another surgery right now doesn‚Äôt seem appealing. will wait a few more months before i decide.

Hi there, I hope that after 2 years, you have been fully recovered and had -0- complications!!!
<br>
I&#39;m considering Dr. Ng for bottom surgery, anything else you want to share about your experience with Dr Ng?
</p>
<p>
The vacuum seal, and epidural is something I&#39;ve never seen/heard of before but it seems super nice!
<br>
How was the overall recovery?
</p>
<p>
Would love to see updated pics.  Thanks!

The epidural makes it comfortable. Zero pain.  When they start weening you of it, you become aware of the packing in your new vagina, it makes it a little awkward to turn. When the packing comes out, you can definitely feel a difference and it&#39;s not pain as much as it is new sensations which feel a little weird and have to acclimate too.
</p>
<p>
Dilating has been easier than I expected.
</p>
<p>
The most painful part for me has been simply peeing! Because it dribbles everywhere, it gets onto the stitched areas and stings a lot. Nothing a topical novacaine ointment can&#39;t solve.

I probably should post an update photo soon. I have full depth to the last dot on the dilator. I had A PI with peritoneal cap. My vaginal I‚Äôm told looks very cis. Clit works. Have had a few orgasms so far.  I do have a few internal granulation so and need to go in for them to cauterized.  healing went well. Once I was of the epidural, day 3, I didn‚Äôt need or take pain meds. It wasn‚Äôt pain to me, just the feeling of a lot of swelling and I just wanted to experience the ‚Äòbirth‚Äô of my healing vagina and be aware of it‚Äôs coming into the world rather than sedating myself. But that‚Äôs me. We all experience pain or discomfort differently. :)
