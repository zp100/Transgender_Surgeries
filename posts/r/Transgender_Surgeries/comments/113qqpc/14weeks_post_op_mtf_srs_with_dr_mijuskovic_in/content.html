Congrats! Can i ask what is the pink tissue on the bottom right in the last picture? Is that the erectile tissue? Also what else can be revisited on a second surgery?

Yeah not the really big changes since my last update. Since im more active again dialating got a bit harder, it feels like stuff is stiffer down there when i do a lot of physical work. I currently dialate 2 times a day, i hope i can go down to one time a day in 4 weeks at my next consultation. Im still a bit restricted in my movement, though its really minor stuff now, like bending down to get something on the floor. Oh and i had my first orgasm yesterday after 3 months of not beeing able to. I think it was because i wasn&#39;t able to put enough pressure on the clit until now, maybe its also just training and getting used to the new body and how shit works down there now. The only thing i dont like aesthetically atm. is the remaining erectile tissue that is still very visible from the outside, maybe i can further remove it in a second operation, because i also think it being there makes it harder to have penetrative sex atm.

You know what confuses /excites me?
</p>
<p>
You got great result which is awesome. Also you speak very casually about the whole procedure. Like as if the whole after care and dilation regimen is really not that difficult. In fact the whole recovery seemed doable when I look at your results.
</p>
<p>
And on the other hand you have these super complex stories about girls that had to retreat from life for months just to upkeep the initial phase of care and recovery and whatnot.
</p>
<p>
Does anybody else feel like that? I&#39;m really on the fence if SRS will alter my lifestyle fundamentally just to keep that plumbing going...

Well i dont want to give the image that it was all easy and simple. I mean i didnt do much besides dialating, watching netflix and sleeping for like 4-5 weeks. Then i started up life again a bit, but its only 4 weeks since i feel like im fully in life again. It is doable, but its still a lot. Like the first three days after surgery were ✨hard✨ but it gets better every day from there on.

Yeah i mean you make the time in between longer and longer and best case would be if you can replace it with sex at one point. people i know that had it 8 years ago or so do it like once a month just to check if still everything is okay

Hmm Healthcare is probably one of the best. Waiting lists arent long for operations and usually everything will be paid, even VFS and FFS. With hormones its also okay unless you want injections, because doctors wont give you that. Endocrinologists dont really know how to treat trans women besides a few in Zurich. So you have to be an expert on your own. DIY is a thing here
</p>
<p>
Law wise its okay, we can now change our names and gender without a medical approval and trial thats new since 2022. But there isnt really a law protecting us against discrimination.
</p>
<p>
The general society has now heard that we exist and has some sort of opinion about us. In every small city you can find yourself a bubble with green/left people that will support you but you may have still to do some work with them because they might not know a lot. There are of course also big lgbtq communitys but more in the big cities. But yeah with the standard society you have about a 50/50 chance what reaction you will get if you dont pass.
</p>
<p>
The biggest party, the right wing SVP, now just started a campaign where they try to import that US culture war shit. If this works and they can make ground with that sort of stuff then the countryside will shift from &#34;uhhhh dunno&#34; to hate and that will be uncomfortable. I generally hope that this doesnt work.
</p>
<p>
Yeah so if you pass, no problemo
</p>
<p>
If you are organized, no problemo
</p>
<p>
Healthcare, no problemo
</p>
<p>
SVP, big problemo

i’m a little late to this, but your results look amazing.  i’ve heard from everyone that if you’re gonna get srs in switzerland, then go to dr. mijuskovic.  i have an appointment for a consult with her in october and after seeing this, i’m looking forward to it, although i am a little nervous with my insurance.  how are things functionally?  i am looking forward to all the options i have available to me when i’m post op so i’m hoping that part goes well as well.

Also everyting  looking like I could also be at her care and I have heard good things about her outside of reddit in Trans-meetings when talking about this stuff.
<br>
The university hospital in Basel kinda crystalized to be the go-to spot for vaginoplasty, over the last year or two...

from what i’ve heard, mijuskovic is the best in switzerland. a good friend of mine had her srs done by mijuskovic and she’s happy with the results. mijuskovic now works at zuger kantonsspital, but she does consults in zurich. i have a consult with her in just under a month in zurich and i assume the surgery will be done in baar

That one is very good to know. I also remember that I have heard that but I wasn&#39;t sure on my memories, especially since I am very bad with names. 😅
<br>
Also in consultation fairly soon, it may take a while as I am still fairly early on HRT (1y4m) for surgery.
<br>
But it was more meant to temper my expectations and see what is up in context of my specific medical situation.
<br>
May be time in a year or so though. ^^

i’m a little ahead of you on hrt (1 year, 5 months), but i think the conditions for most operations is that you’re at least 1 year on hrt (2 years for breast augmentation). i should have had these consults and maybe even an operation or two earlier, but i had 1 psychiatrist dismiss my dysphoria and say he wouldn’t support me getting ffs and then i had another tell me i’m too depressed for my transition (as if dysphoria helps with depression).  but i have had two of them, i’m waiting to change my insurance before a kostengutsprache gets sent. hopefully it will be approved

Ouch, that really sucks... :/
<br>
My therapist so far has been very good to me and was more like &#34;are there maybe some things that can improve stuff for you beforehand?&#34; instead of &#34;you can&#39;t go cuz too depressed.&#34;
<br>
And she was definetly okay with getting a first consultation talk to get expectations on my situation, since I have a few special medical issues that they may resolve while they&#39;re at it if possible. So it&#39;s more to sort my case rather than getting on it.

it’s pretty rough, but i found a psychologist who could refer me and say that i’m in a place to do these operations.  my current therapist is also really good so far.  she would 100% back me up if i need it. i’m pretty much good to go with operations, at least as far as i’m concerned. i have absolutely no plans on letting anything/anyone getting in the way of my transition
