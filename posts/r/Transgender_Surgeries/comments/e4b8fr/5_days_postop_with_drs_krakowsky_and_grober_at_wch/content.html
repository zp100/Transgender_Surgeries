Going to try to keep things a bit shorter than yesterday so I can get to sleep before midnight. Hopefully I&#39;ll get an uninterrupted night sometime soon, last night woke me once up with gas pains again. On the bright side, I pooped! So there&#39;s a lot less abdominal pressure going on now.
</p>
<p>
Today reminded me that pain management is incredibly important. I mistimed my morning dose (I had my PRN med after breakfast instead of before), and breakfast kind of wiped me out so I had a morning nap. On the bright side, I managed to get super cozy and woke up feeling warm and refreshed and NOT IN PAIN!!! (Seriously, I didn&#39;t really appreciate how awesome pain free wakeups are until this morning.)
</p>
<p>
I got dressed completely unassisted for the first time since surgery since I was going to head down to the cafeteria on the main floor to have lunch with my wife and daughter. I surprised myself that I was able to (barely) get my own socks on, and getting dressed took a lot longer than it would normally, but I managed it. We had delicious takeout Indian since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, and I got to snuggle my daughter a bit, as well as get some fresh air while not in intense pain. All in all, a great visit... that wiped me out again and got me back in bed to recover.
</p>
<p>
The big event of the day that more or less dominated my afternoon / evening was pooping. GA constipates me, opioids constipate me, and not being up and moving about doesn&#39;t help any either. (I went from running ~5-6km 3x a week to basically almost completely inactive.) Worst constipation ever, but I managed to relax through it (pushing = bad for the rear incisions) and got at least most of the way caught up on things. It was a very intense experience that I&#39;m not going to post, and one that I went through without the heavy painkillers in my system (see pain management, importance thereof. I started the process at the tail end of my last dose and was so focused on the process that I didn&#39;t re-dose. At the same time, much of the pain was from pressure, which most painkillers don&#39;t really touch, so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;d have made a significant difference.)
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, the relief was huge, and I was pleasantly surprised by the positivity of the staff who knew that both a) I hadn&#39;t had a bowel movement yet, and b) that I&#39;d just had one. Back to bed, more meds, more relaxation before heading to dinner, still feeling kind of wiped out. Back to bed again after dinner.
</p>
<p>
Out of bed again for a refill of my water bottle turned into an evening snack and chat with the other women here, and then back to bed. (Typing it out, I think my body is trying to tell me something, maybe that it&#39;s tired and needs more down time than I&#39;m giving it?) I then discovered that while all of the powered controls on my bed I had tried so far were working, the one to raise the bed wasn&#39;t. I found this out after lowering the bed just a little bit too far to comfortably get into and out of. Oops. Then I made it worse by experimenting to make sure I wasn&#39;t doing something wrong, and whether or not the bed would reset itself if I put it all the way down. No on both counts. Fortunately the other bed in my room is unoccupied and the staff got me shifted over into it. They also brought me my meds in the process, including the PRN painkillers, which helped a LOT in managing the roadbump of not being able to crawl back into bed. (Oh look, pain management, it&#39;s fucking important.)
</p>
<p>
After that, I was able to do my nighttime routine, albeit delayed, and I&#39;m ready for what I hope might be a solid chunk of sleep. *fingers crossed*
</p>
<p>
As always, feel free to AMA, though I don&#39;t guarantee that I&#39;ll answer.

<p>
On a side note:
</p>
<p>
I seem to lack most of my filters when making these posts and just stream of consciousness about my days. Is this genuinely helpful? Would it be more beneficial if I tried to condense it down a bit?

Thank you for the feedback, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re finding them useful, and it&#39;s kind of cathartic to get it out there. I find that it&#39;s easier to write these than it would be to condense them down, I can just word vomit instead of having to think about what was really important from my day.
