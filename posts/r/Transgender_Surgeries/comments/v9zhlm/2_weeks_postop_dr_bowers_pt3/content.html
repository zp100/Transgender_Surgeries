Here to share my experience with Bowers. I know that she is a focal point of interest conversations and also pin ðŸ“Œ to this page. Not defending her since everyone has their experience that is true to them. This is about mine, from a point of view of an immigrant white Mexican trans woman.
</p>
<p>
Even though my surgeon n was Bowers there will be similarities with any surgeon like exhaustion from walking, bowel movements, pain, bulb extraction, etc.
</p>
<p>
*Day 2 post-op Today was not so boring! By the morning and through the day my pain level stayed between 2-4 and no longer taking narcotics just ibuprofen and ketorolac. Closer to noon the gauze shell came out. The nurse was impressed by the small amount of blood on it. I cried like expected and of course, took pictures.  My bulb was about empty, so much that throughout my stay they used what looked like a half cup measurement. If they had not emptied it at all I would doubt that it had gotten full.  Lunch was nice I had visitors and I was able to have a normal conversation.  Around 2 pm I was taken out for a walk around the wing! The 2nd best thing of the day! My back was dying and it was nice to stretch. Of course, I was exhausted. As soon as I got to the room again I fell asleep. Woke up with the urgency of a bowel movement. So there was another bedpan experience.  Right after I was cleaned Dr. Bowers and the visiting Denmark doctors arrived to check in and say hi. Again bowers made comments on aesthetics, and again I thought it was weird but not uncomfortable. I guess most plastic surgeons are focused on the looks of stuff, it&#39;s their job. Anyways after they left I slept again woke up for dinner and slept again
</p>
<p>
*Day 3 post-op I get to go home! Dr. Bowers said she&#39;s come late morning to take my bulb out, I had a feeling it was going to be after lunch. I was right but while I waited I went on two separate walks around the wing and pooped by myself in the restroom! Yay! I mean I had a CNA assisting on walking but I was alone I was there and wipe my butt. THE FEELING OF INDEPENDENCE! it&#39;s weird what makes highlights when you had major surgery and are stuck in bed. Oh! I also had a shower! I thought that if something were to happen might as well that it happened in the hospital. Nothing happened but it felt rejuvenating having a lukewarm shower, you don&#39;t want scalding water on wounds even though I love to cook myself in the shower.  Anyways one walk was in the morning the other one right after lunch.  Bowers came around 3 and took the bulb out. Faster than expected and not extremely painful but definitely uncomfortable and super weird sensation, any pain was gone after 5 min. The catheter was way for painful but I&#39;ll get to that later.  I waited for the hospital to get all things together for discharge. I was asked if I wanted the leg bag for the catheter, but I declined. The bag that I had was not too big and I couldn&#39;t see myself constantly draining it and changing it at night. Also if folks are gross-out by a pee bag that it&#39;s coming from a clean-looking person it&#39;s not my fault. Everyone pees. Not going to stop taking a walk in the park because of someone else&#39;s comfort. It wasn&#39;t like I was going to go to restaurants or the movies, I mostly went to parks and playgrounds with my family and always empty my bag before going. Well, by 4:30 I was ready to leave the hospital.  I walked to the car while mom and partner carried my stuff and a CNA walked along with me.  The car ride was not bad at all I had a donut. Bowers seems to disapprove of the use of them but seems that she was talking about the air-filled ones since what talking about not being stable. I had a foam donut with flat bottom and top, it worked great and I used it for all car rides and hard surfaces like the dining chairs.  After I got home I ate and fell asleep. All that walking and car ride was super exhausting.

Getting long again so I&#39;ll ride another part. The next one will be a quick summary of the days between the hospital and post-op. The post-op appointment and travel after surgery.

It would help people follow your posts if you linked them together, old ones to new, new to old.
