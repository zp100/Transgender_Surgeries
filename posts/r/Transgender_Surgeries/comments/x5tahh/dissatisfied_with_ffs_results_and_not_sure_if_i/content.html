I (MtF, 27) had FFS a year and a half ago and the result has left me totally dissatisfied with my appearance and has me wondering about what I&#39;m going to do with my life. I know passing isn&#39;t everything but the fact that after spending tens of thousand of euros I still don&#39;t pass is really demoralising. I always knew I didn&#39;t blend in as a woman but I thought that post-FFS I would have a very real possibility of being able to assimmilate but that&#39;s not the case at all and now I feel like I was deluding myself the whole time. The two main problems are the dysphoria I still feel about my appearance and the problems being a non-passing trans woman introduces into your life. I don&#39;t think I have the confidence to try and have a social life or a career where people can see my face when I am tacitly non-passing. I feel constantly ashamed that people see this way and I feel resentment for myself for believing FFS would solve it.
</p>
<p>
Before FFS I would often stare at myself in the mirror and take recordings on my phone orbiting my face to see the angles that strangers see and my appearance looked clearly male. Now I feel like my face is kind of uncanny but more male than female. I have a very long, masculine, oval-shaped facial structure and I don&#39;t think changing my facial features can affect that. My friend who had FFS with the same surgeon but who now passes easily insists that it&#39;s in my head but the fact that I am still gendered male all the time by strangers makes me doubt her. The way people treat me is exactly the same as before FFS and nobody in my life ever commented that my appearance had changed. I asked one relative if they noticed anything different about how I looked and he said no. I showed him the before photos and he said he couldn&#39;t notice any changes. I had my browbone, the bones around my eyes, my jawline and my chin all operated on for a huge sum of money. How is it even possible that a year later and fully recovered I look the same?
</p>
<p>
What do I do now? I thought about seeing a psychologist but FFS was so expensive that I can&#39;t really afford to. Am I crazy for entertaining the thought of having more facial surgery in the future? Do I just have BDD? I feel like my only options are to either give up or have a second attempt at something that would be very expensive and might leave me even more disappointed and neither option sounds appealing.
<strong>
Has anyone ever been dissatisfied with their first FFS attempt but satisfied with their second?
</strong>
Are some people just doomed to never pass?

Hey hun‚Ä¶ u might need a second surgery that‚Äôs just life. Some drs r not as aggressive as others when it comes to ffs! U need to go to a dr who is aggressive at changing the facial features. Some trans girls need very aggressive work and some need more subtle. Sounds like aggressive would have worked better for u. If u lived her in the states like California it would cover your ffs for free actually and breast implants and bottom surgery! It‚Äôs all covered under insurance ace in many us states. But if u can‚Äôt come here I might have to find a more aggressive dr there and get a revision‚Ä¶ did u get cheek implants!?? Cheeks can massively feminize the face. Maybe u can send me a photos of yer before and after I‚Äôm private and I will help u figure out what u need to change to pass. I have a very amazing eye for these things and I promise I‚Äôll try my best to help u. Message me on private hun. I just wanna help. U can go look at my pics too if u want on my page here. Hope to hear from u soon‚Ä¶ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüíã

hey! üññüèª
</p>
<p>
I feel for you. My wife &lt;36y&gt; had her FFS with Dr. Funk in Munich, a colleague of Dr. Spiegel operating in USA. Much like you, she&#39;s not entirely happy with the result and still sees the masculine even though it&#39;s been radically sanded away. The operation lasted 8 hours, maximum time span.
</p>
<p>
I think she looks great. She gets more positive feedback from friends and at work. There are few good days, but most of the time she doubts it and thinks everyone sees her as a man in dress in disguise.
</p>
<p>
it makes me sad to see her so unhappy and don&#39;t know how to support sue.

Do you have any more info on Dr Funk? A link or even a full name would be good.

Sometimes its all in our heads tbh. Im sure you look great. not trying to dismiss your feelings but most girls after FFS look great even if they can&#39;t see it

Well it would help to have photos front, side, and over &amp; under to see the cranial, brow to nose and cheek ratio
</p>
<p>
List the prior surgeon / state
</p>
<p>
And which procedures they done Also was it by there ideal to only do a limited procedure ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
I know I consulted a doc but there ideal of beauty was warped and disrespectful from my own intentions and I was only expecting what is possible from my own scans that could be realistic.
</p>
<p>
This guy was a senior and even said he knows what kind of women he likes so he knows what I should look like. ü§¨üò° This asshole wanted androgyny and masculine refusing to do any jaw work, orbital rim, or a lift on one of my upper eyelids that has excess skin that looks lazy. He wanted to only do 40% of the brow so there was still going to be significant bossing to avoid a plate implant despite telling him I was content with one if needed since my brow sinuses were underdeveloped and shouldn‚Äôt even be a problem to begin with.
</p>
<p>
I believe the docs name was James E Zins or something with Ohio Cleveland clinic

Try
<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/19059-bahar-bassiri-gharb" rel="nofollow">Dr. Bahar Bassiri Gharb
</a>
. She does FFS at the CC. You won&#39;t have the same issue you had with Zin.

I feel you! I&#39;ve had ffs and the surgeon was very conservative and didn&#39;t make me (imo) feminine enough. So now I am struggling with the next step.
