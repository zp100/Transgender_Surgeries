It&#39;s been a month! I&#39;m definitely still healing, but the worst of the swelling has gone down. I don&#39;t need ice all the time.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the fluid coming out of my vagina when I squeeze has been urine, which means there&#39;s a hole in my bladder/urethra. The surgeon says they can fix it though, if it doesn&#39;t heal on its own. I haven&#39;t noticed much fluid today though so here&#39;s hoping I&#39;m on the right track.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve lost a little bit of depth, but I can still get the dilator in about 13.5 cm, or all but the last dot. Today I started the orange dilator again after stopping it when I got freaked out about the urine (I had used it a couple days in a row almost a week ago). I&#39;ve been doing 30 minutes with the purple, then 15 with the orange. I&#39;ve also been trying out a lube applicator to try to get the lube deeper in my vagina. It mostly just oozes out before I get the dilator in, but I&#39;m still experimenting.
</p>
<p>
Okay, picture time.

Your posts are so interesting and I appreciate you keeping us updated with your process and healing. I didn’t know this was possible and it might be an option to consider. One question I forgot to ask is: in the future when they create the labia, there’s only going to be the penis and the vagina left, right? Meaning no trace of where the testicles used to be or tissue there?

Thanks, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re finding my posts helpful!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure yet exactly what&#39;s possible for the labia. In my ideal world, they&#39;d integrate nicely with my penis so it would kind of look like a large clit. There might be a way to at least make them connect naturally to the rest of my scrotum. I&#39;ll probably sketch up a picture of my goals at some point and share it.

This is probably not very realistic (and doesn&#39;t quite reflect my current goals anymore), but here&#39;s what I drew for Dr Wittenberg in December 2020:

When you dilate is it sensitive or does it feel like pressure? I’m not even sure it can be explained, if not no worries. Also, is this a one surgery process or are there more in line?
</p>
<p>
Congratulations on your surgery! I hope your bladder/urethra heal on its own quickly. I appreciate your information. I’m excited to schedule my consultation in the next few months.

Thanks! Best of luck with your consultation! Is it also for this same thing with Dr Wittenberg?
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t feel exactly like skin or anything, but I feel like calling it pressure doesn&#39;t really do it justice. It&#39;s incredibly detailed, and I can feel exactly how deep the dilator is. I can feel it sliding, which is really weird, and I can feel it irritating the swelling inside, which is unpleasant. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m missing anything in terms of sensation. It all feels &#34;right.&#34; (For what it&#39;s worth, partners I&#39;ve had with natal vaginas described a similar thing to me. There&#39;s really no touch sensation inside.)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to get a labiaplasty in about a year with Dr Wittenberg. I&#39;m waiting for this to heal though before I figure out exactly what I want out of it in terms of aesthetics and sensation.

Yes, I’m scheduling a consult for the same thing with Dr. Wittenberg and I am probably twice as excited now thanks to your sharing of your journey.
</p>
<p>
That could not have been a better explanation of exactly what I was wondering in regards to sensation.
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate you letting us experience through you. Thank you so much! I can’t wait!

<p>
This makes sense, because the mechanoreceptors on the tissue should be similar to a vaginal lining… namely, you should be able to feel “grip” and “hot/cold”, but not really “touch”.

Yep, that makes sense. I can also feel texture, kinda, in a weird way? I can tell the difference between two different lubes I used because of how the dilator felt going in. It might be that as the dilator goes in, the way it slides against the skin makes vibrations that carry and I can feel elsewhere? I don&#39;t know how that shit works, brains are amazing

I got my insurance to cover it at the in-network rate by arguing for a GAP exception. They made a Single Case Agreement with Dr Wittenberg and with the hospital. I haven&#39;t seen the bill yet, but I expect to hit my max out of pocket, which for last year was $2000.

Dr Wittenberg is in San Francisco.

The material came from peritoneal tissue in my abdomen. They went through my belly button laparoscopically and pulled it down into the vaginal cavity. It stayed connected to its blood supply the entire time, so it&#39;s not a graft exactly, and has a lower complication rate.
</p>
<p>
Most of the recovery time is from the internal parts of the surgery, so I don&#39;t think adding a penectomy and clitoplasty and labiaplasty would change much, except for comfort sitting and amount of swelling. But that&#39;s with peritoneal pull-through. I think penile inversion still has a faster recovery over all.

As someone who’s still very new can I ask (without sounding like I’m being nasty etc) what the point of this surgery is? I’ve said i would only get bottom surgery if my penis stops being useful for anything other than peeing out of and it becomes a hinderance for clothing. Is it purely for sex?

I&#39;m not sure I fully follow what you&#39;re saying about your own surgical plans, but as for me I don&#39;t have dysphoria about my penis and I&#39;m fond of it. I plan to use it for all the usual things, although I don&#39;t really top anymore if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking about.

See if you still like and use your penis then why get the vagina? And I don’t mean this in a nasty way so please dont take offense, I’m just curious.

Because I got dysphoria from not having one. I just felt like my body was wrong without it.
</p>
<p>
I also have always wanted to enjoy sex in certain ways that aren&#39;t possible without a vagina.
