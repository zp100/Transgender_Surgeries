are you possibly experiencing granulation in your vaginal canal? Loss of depth and bleeding are symptoms, a gynecologist could examine and treat if there is any granulated tissue.

Yes I get granulation every other 1,5 weeks that I have to go see my surgeon every time it happens. So I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. My surgeon is suggesting to go under again to laser up the scar tissues and possibly open up the canal again but see it‚Äôs gonna resist again.
</p>
<p>
I am thinking about PPT as an option but I hear that it‚Äôs not as stretchy as colon feeling wise and depth is usually longer with colon. However , I‚Äôd rather do PPT bc of less complication and easier recovery plus it grows itself afterwards so idküò≠üò≠üò≠

PPT or sigmoid colon vaginoplasty could be options for depth absolutely! I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. Have you looked into a pelvic floor physical therapist? I‚Äôve heard similar stories with PI Vaginoplasty losing depth and have heard a lot of girls can get depth back but it takes time. But with the bleeding you mentioned it would be good to see either your surgeon or another surgeon that specializes in revisions to get their opinions on how they can support you. üíú

Which do you think is better? Based on my research colon might be better as it‚Äôs more stable n stretchy and less likely to collapse. I‚Äôve read so many PPT posts that it may not much different than PI when it comes to depth

I don‚Äôt think I could speak on that. And there‚Äôs only so many people out of all the folks who get surgery who post here, so while the information can be helpful I think it‚Äôs ultimately best to consult with surgeons who do different methods to ask them all the questions you could think of.

I don‚Äôt have the funds to do it. I found a doctor who specializes in urology and takes insurance. He operates with gastric surgeon who assist with the colon part and urologist stitches the colon into vagina! I guess my concerns is what was ur recovery process? I am an athletic person who lifts heavy so I def don‚Äôt wanna lose that ability. I‚Äôm also concerned about my life expectancy and bowel movement.

Oh I can&#39;t be 100 sure for others but mine was pretty good and basic. I was able to walk run or lift heavy stuff after 3 months but I am a slim person (maybe athletic) but surely I don&#39;t gain weight no matter how much I eat, I heard from doctors mostly complications occur if you&#39;re obese or have previous history of bowel disease.

Vaginal stenosis is a widespread complication with the skin-grafted canal. Sister, get a colon revision in Thailand with Dr. Theerapong.

I also have a similar story, had PI 11 months ago. Followed the aftercare however also lost depth. I‚Äôm not bleeding. However I feel how you feel. Sorta just lost. Like I know my surgery wasn‚Äôt a waist I worked and waited a long time for this. Just seems like I‚Äôm back to square one hiding in my home cause I just don‚Äôt want to deal with it. Again just my experience not sure about yours. If anyone has a solution I‚Äôd love to know. I would love my depth back. With the least risks.

I‚Äôm really sorry you had that experience. Tho remember every vagina is different. You are a women. We got this. I believe the reason why we have this issue is due to the excess skin. I will say I don‚Äôt regret PI as it was a fast recovery. Tho just hate that I probably may need a revision. If I do then that‚Äôs ok. I just want to be able to have vag sex lol. Also if you have like a yard what‚Äôs been helping me is doing yoga outside or going for a hike tho idk where you live. But definitely do a solo trail. Ik the burden of feeling like you don‚Äôt belong. It‚Äôs just dysphoria. Tho if we got past it once we can do it again. Just know your not alone.

Yes, it‚Äôs all good. I‚Äôve gained so much weight due to wanting to get bbl that like people clock me so much now lmao so that‚Äôs another reason as to maybe I don‚Äôt even need to get a revision. I feel like I need to be honest with myself and others. I need to accept that I am a trans woman and no amount of surgeries will ever make cis or ‚Äúclose‚Äù to cis lol.

That‚Äôs valid, sorry you‚Äôve been getting clocked definitely not a fun time. And yea definitely see a therapist to work through that. Again idk for you. However for me. Part of the reason why I got the surgery was so I could live in stealth. However that just is not the reality. Tho I can be somewhat passable. Deep down I know I‚Äôm not a cis girl. And I‚Äôve accepted that. I am a women of trans experience. So now I‚Äôm just trying to live my life, and trying to find a partner that loves me for me not what I have down their.

Then you could give the skin-graft another chance to regain depth however, the failure rate for that is rather high.

Sorry you also had complications. I will say they did a great job. And know that loss of depth is a common complication sadly but we got this. I too and hoping I find a solution I may go see my gyno soon.

My best friend who is short (5&#39;4&#34;) had PI and then PPT revision and that added another inch. If you had PI, then PPT is the best option. The best in the northeast are Bluebond-Langer in NYC and Jonathan Keith in New Jersey.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that is not talked about is &#34;dynamic dilation;&#34; my best friend and other girlfriend do this. Dynamic dilation is done using a Motor Bunny or a Sybian.

Try temple in PA they have a team of a surgeon and urologist that do surgeries together and I have Cigna Open Access Plus and they take that insurance idk what you have but it might be acceptable. FYI they don‚Äôt do virtual consultations as of 1/15/24. You can try and ask on the phone but didn‚Äôt work for me. Good luck
