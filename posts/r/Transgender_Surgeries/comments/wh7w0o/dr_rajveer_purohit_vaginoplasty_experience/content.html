My daughter had vaginoplasty surgery with Dr. Purohit in May 2022. We met with him the first time December 2021. When we first met with Dr Purohit, he was very thorough and patient. He took the time to answer all of our questions and used the whiteboard in the exam room to visually diagram the different options in a way that made it easy to understand. We never felt rushed and we could tell pretty quickly he was the surgeon we wanted to use. From there, we started the scheduling process and started working with Sam in the office to get everything sorted out. Having Sam on our team made us feel like we were having a VIP experience. Sam walked us through every step of the process from billing to paperwork to accommodations (since we are from out of town), to what to expect every step of the process. Sam did the communications with all of the departments to make sure everything went smoothly. I honestly feel like we could not have done this without her help. Dr. Purohit did a wonderful job on the surgery and my daughter is extremely happy with the outcome and functionality of her new vagina and vulva, but we all know behind the scenes experiences can make or break the final outcome. Sam did an amazing job coordinating everything and making sure we were taken care of every step of the way. At one point after my daughter surgery, she had a small issue that put us in the emergency room and Dr Purohit‘s team was at her bedside within five minutes of us arriving, even before an ER nurse or doc.  They were able to fix the issue and put everything at ease. After the surgery, our questions and need for assistance did not stop, and Dr Purohit and his team were always there to help us with whatever we needed. It has been over two months and my daughter is completely healed, and I still feel like Sam and Dr Purohit are family. Dr. Purohit is very obviously a brilliant surgeon, and very good at what he does, but he also cares about his patients and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure the experience is top notch from start to finish. Highly recommend. I was a very nervous mother and I’m so thankful for the care we received from Dr Purohit, Sam, and the rest of the behind-the-scenes team. My daughter’s vagina and vulva are beautiful!

From our meeting to the surgery was 6 months. They worked with our schedule as we had to wait for my daughter to turn 18 and we wanted to do it while she was on break from school and had three months to recover.  The cost was around $70k. We did not have insurance that covered it. They gave my daughter pain killers but she didn’t use them once out of hospital (3 days in hospital). She rotated Tylenol and ibuprofen for about 10 days and that was effective. Pain wasn’t too bad she said. Her depth was about 5.5”. She had been on depo Lupron hormone blockers since she was 13yp. She had standard penile inversion. The outside looks perfect and beautiful.  The only probable n we had was after catheter came out she had swelling later that night and couldn’t pee. That was what took us to ER but it was an easy fix and catheter went back in for another week with no problem. There was some stitches breakdown from that problem peeing and her trying to push urine out but it has healed perfectly. We used manuka honey for two months under dr Purohit’s instruction. Perfect healing.

How were your costs $70k? Im just curious because the other non insurance costs I’ve seen floated around are $15k-40k. I’ve never seen a cost that high.

Thank you for being a great mom though. I actually showed my mom this post to help convince her and my dad to support it for me.
