Sigh... What can I do about post-op internal vaginal hair? I&#39;ve only found 2 fo far but it&#39;s 2 more than I should have. I was able to pull out one but the other one is too painful. The one I pulled out feels like it grows from 3 inches in, but I&#39;m not sure really. Dr. Rumer&#39;s web page says that her &#34;technique does not require elecrolysis or laser hair removal of the genital area, and there is NO regrowth.&#34; -

<p>
I&#39;m pretty disappointed. Excuse the messy pictures. I just finished dilating and when I remove the dilator, it draws out the hair to make it visible. The white stuff is just from my prescription cream. Do I have options to get these hairs removed??

From what all ive read and heard you should be able to go to a gynecologist and get them lasered or something so they dont grow back. Im sorry I wish I had more information but its something to definitely ask your gynecologist.

I believe they can be removed with electrolysis. You&#39;ll have to find an electrologist or gynecologist that can offer that.

Electrolysis works, but only near the entrance. It’s not going to work deep inside. You might be able to find someone who can cauterise deep hair, like a gynaecologist or surgeon, but it’s probably very difficult.

I’d guess it’s possible, but they don’t want to bother. And I’d doubt the ones you can see are too deep to access.

They are definitely too deep to remove, even though I can see them. They grow so long that I can pull on them with tweezers. I can literally feel them from the back of my vagina, and it&#39;s too painful to pluck them out. I was only able to successfully pull one out one time and it was about 2.5 inches long. It&#39;s a long fucking pube from the very back. My gyno was able to see them also.

Hey there, I’ve been dealing with internal vaginal hair for the past three years.
</p>
<p>
There’s a few options you can utilize:
</p>
<p>
For the hairs growing right near the entrance of the canal, it’ll be possible to have electrolysis performed on them. Electrolysis can’t be performed on hairs deep inside since they’re not reachable by the needle, but the ones at the very front will be reachable. It’s difficult finding a technician with the experience and comfort to be able to do so though.
</p>
<p>
As others have mentioned, you could opt for a cauterization of the hair follicles with a surgeon or gynecologist. I honestly have never been able to find a gynecologist who has experience with post operative hair, let alone being able to remove it, however my original surgeon mentioned she could cauterize the hair in the first few inches of the canal. However, the huge downside to cauterization is it’s just a simple heat zap as my surgeon explained, and gets progressively more difficult to perform the deeper you attempt to go. It isn’t always a concrete solution to ridding the hair fully and requires sedation in order to be performed.
</p>
<p>
You could also try having a doctor apply silver nitrate on the hair follicles, I’ve heard of this working for some people. However, the same downside exists where it isn’t always a concrete solution and difficult to reach deep within. I’ve heard of it causing permanent reduction of hairs but I’ve never heard of it fully solving the hair issue in the few cases I’ve seen reported here.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the only sure way to fully solve the hair issue once and for all (and what I’m faced with considering currently) is removing the penile/scrotal graft completely and having the vaginal lining redone with peritoneal or sigmoid tissue.  Essentially going through vaginoplasty again.
</p>
<p>
I know these options aren’t the most ideal, I wish you luck and hope you can get the issue solved.
</p>

Thank you for the long reply, but I am definitely not going through vaginoplasty again. I&#39;ve already done this twice.... 1) my original botched surgery with Rumer and 2) my necessary revision with another surgeon. I just can&#39;t do major surgery again. I&#39;m too traumatized by all of this. About 15-20% of my head hair fell out from the physical stress of my 2nd surgery. At least most of it has grown back, but I can&#39;t do this again.

I&#39;ve spoken to my 2nd surgeon and two specialists since this post and everyone has told me that that&#39;s really nothing that can be done because of how deep these hairs are. The hairs feel like they&#39;re at the very back end of my vagina. My gyno was able to see them upon inspection but they are just too deep to remove. I can often feel these hairs when I dilate. It feels like the most upper/back area of my vagina is scratchy when I push deep with my dilators. There&#39;s rough pubic hair all the way inside my vagina. I hate thinking about it but I don&#39;t have a choice. My 2nd surgeon said that the hairs shouldn&#39;t cause any issues at least, but they shouldn&#39;t be there in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rumer is a fucking liar. I&#39;m immensely pissed off and upset. She&#39;s still falsely advertising on her website right now that her &#34;technique does not require electrolysis or laser hair removal of the genital area before surgery, and there is NO regrowth.&#34; My goddamn medical records say otherwise.
<strong>
Irreputable bullshit doctor.
</strong>
Just one of my
<strong>
many
</strong>
complications from her.

Who do I report her to for false advertising? Can i sue her for this? One of the main reasons I saw to her is cuz her website guarantees &#34;no regrowth&#34; and hair removal before surgery isn&#39;t necessary.

holy shit. there are 4 malpractice cases against her, and all of the plaintiffs have the same lawyer.
</p>
<p>
also, read page 2 here:

(this is publicly available info)
</p>
<p>
It looks like Dr. Rumer left 4 hairs in this patient&#39;s vagina and this was signed on the bottom by Dr. Rumer&#39;s own lawyers! What the actual fuck is going on?!

I just noticed... Page 3 of that PDF says &#34;Hair growth is a recognized complication of vaginoplasty. Complete hair removal, whether it is done pre-operatively or post-operatively is never guaranteed.&#34;
</p>
<p>
One of the main reasons I saw Dr. Rumer is because her website literally says &#34;Dr. Rumer’s Vaginoplasty technique does not require electrolysis or laser hair removal of the genital area before surgery, and there is NO regrowth.&#34; -

I already saw that one. How does Rumer still have a license to practice? I wasn&#39;t previously aware that there were 4 malpractice cases against Rumer,
<strong>
all with the same counsel for the plaintiffs

and according to this, Dr. Rumer has $500,000 in physician&#39;s insurance? Since she was sued 4x, does this mean that she gets paid up to $500,000 four times?

I have no idea what happened with the malpractice suits. I never sued her because my main and only goal ever at the time was getting fixed. I wasn’t letting her touch me again after the gaslighting and her clear incompetence, but I also couldn’t give any new surgeon a reason to feel like I would be more trouble than I was worth.
</p>
<p>
For the record, I still have hair in my vagina and still haven’t gotten fixed over seven years later. Marci Bowers tried originally in 2015 to give me a revision but she only made things devastatingly worse. Could I sue her either? No.
</p>
<p>
I was trying to get fixed. It wasn’t about money.
</p>
<p>
That being said… my life was ruined and I got zero money… and I have debit and live a pretty unremarkable life now struggling permanently with my mental health because of all of this. Could an an infusion of cash have given me some stability from which to rebuild, maybe. It’s so hard to fight over money when the concern is fixing your body. When your mental health is so in the gutter that you feel like you are fighting to justify your life, talking about money is a hard pivot.
</p>
<p>
The uninformed well-intentioned unhelpful elements in my life (in this case, my siblings and family included at one point), would say hurtful stuff like…. “If you sue then you’ll have money to get fixed.”
</p>
<p>
The reality was: “I need a really complicated surgery to get fixed, most of these doctors I have visited are worried they will do more harm than good. Money absolutely isn’t the issue, and either way our parents can front me the cash if I had a doctor lined up. Suing could take years, I’m probably past the short statues of limitations anyway, and the last thing I need is to turn these doctors into adversaries because the example it sends is that I’ll just sue the next one to… and that plus a complicated surgery is an instant no.
</p>
<p>
No sadly I may have a fucked-up vagina and have to spend the rest of my life kissing ass and trying to pretend the surgeons who screwed me up are esteemed professionals. It’s like beginning each conversation with your rapist in a compliment because nobody is gonna have sex with you again if they think you scream rape at everyone.
</p>
<p>
Simplistic notions fail this predicament, except for basically that I am living my best consolation-prize life and never recovered from any of this seven years in. I lost my career dream, my ability for physical intimacy at a time when I was trying to meet partners and get married and they’d literally be disgusted away by it… and even if they didn’t mind, I felt embarrassed, so lots of potential dates ended before they began.
</p>
<p>
I do actually have a first stage of a new surgery to address this finally coming up in a few weeks. It is with a surgeon I first started talking to in late 2019. In early 2020 I was starting to get imaging and preliminary steps done before the pandemic started, then everything just hit pause for over a year. Then his office twiddled their thumbs for a while and I had a family wedding I couldn’t be voluntarily incapacitated over right in the window they opened up shop again, so it got delayed to last month and now rescheduled to this month because I got Covid.
</p>
<p>
In short it has been a mess already and I haven’t even discussed what the actually surgery is to try and carve me up and do skin and nerve grafts. I have no idea if it is going to work or make me worse and I am sick to my stomach over it constantly.

I already had major revision after Rumer with a different surgeon, but this hair issue persists and my 2nd surgeon said it&#39;s not something she can fix. I&#39;m too traumatized to go through a 3rd surgery. At least the rest of my major complications have been resolved and I&#39;m slowly recovering.

I have some hair in my entrance but also further in the back (I only got one pass of electrolysis with mines ) … or so I believe I do it feels like it when I stick my finger in there or when I’m dilating … or when I’m aroused (I have painful erectile tissue ) and I feel like when I’m I guess erect I feel like lil poking going on there. And with African American hair that ish pokes /sticks you. I’m not sure how other hair types feel in those type of situations.
