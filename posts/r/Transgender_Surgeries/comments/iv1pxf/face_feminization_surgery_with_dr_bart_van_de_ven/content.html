In short: He delivers. As looks are highly subjective, I&#39;m incuding the before picture, the advertised preview and the to-date 2 months after picture.
</p>
<p>
Surgery did cost me ~18K € and I had a stay of about one week in an apartment room within the clinic itself (though hotel is also possible, if someone prefers).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
TLDR: I&#39;m very happy that I did the surgery and I&#39;m very happy with the results from Dr. Bart so far (actually, I hoped for a more V-shaped jaw area than in the preview, and it happened;D). As far I can tell, the invest of both, time and money, was well worth it. 100% would do it again, and I fully recommend Dr. Bart for FFS.

I have been to 2Pass for surgery three times including one revision and have also met Dr Bart in London for a couple of appointments.  I found him friendly and professional throughout - even when I returned for the revision (which he didn&#39;t charge me for)
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re staying at the guesthouse, it&#39;s an amazing experience - the whole team, especially Petra, will really try to make you feel at home

Getting a deviated septum corrected at the same time as a cosmetic rhinoplasty is technically possible, but not every surgeon will do it. I&#39;ve had a friend in Canada who had this done, but it was by a local plastic surgeon (not an FFS doctor). Whichever surgeon you chose, you should ask them specifically.

My experience with payment for surgeries is that usually you get the premium treatment once you have paid - which makes sense: once you have paid, you are a valued customer, whereas beforehand they are working probably in vain for you. That said, I can confirm that e-mail communication with 2pass was by quite a margin the weakest part in my experience. I had some detail questions on the proposal and the employee answering the mails at 2pass didn&#39;t understand me well and also didn&#39;t forward the questions to Dr. Bart. So I said &#34;fkk it&#34; and asked Dr. Bart in person once I was there. My mails were answered in time, though. When I had my consultation with Dr. Bart at 2pass, I had already paid everything, I asked him a plethora of questions that I had prepared, and he took the time and patiently answered and explained me everything. He also explained me what surgical steps he was planning, the possible risks etc. just everything I could ask for, so afaict no complaints despite him already having had my money.
</p>
<p>
Regarding your question to have the deviation on the nasal septum corrected together with rhinoplasty: my suggestion would be to no longer bother with the e-mail drone employee at 2pass, just ask for another (Skype) appointment with Dr. Bart and then ask him directly everything regarding your surgery. Even if the appointment costs some two-digit number, it is too important to clarify open questions regarding the surgery itself directly with the surgeon.

May very well be worth the 300€ too though. Or, if it isn&#39;t too late for you to know, you can collect all your questions together and ask them in the preop consultation at the clinic, just as I did. Or, talk to their e-mail drone with Dr. Bart in CC again and tell them to forward your question to Dr. Bart himself, since you need detailed information from the surgeon: you probably don&#39;t just want to know whether or not septum correction is doable same time with rhinoplasty, you probably also wanna know what risks this procedure introduces, whether Dr. Bart actively suggests for or against both at once, how it would affect surgery costs, and what alternatives are available.
</p>
<p>
Btw I&#39;m from Germany too, gonna continue with English though, so everyone can read this. Imho, you can be happy that you pay for the surgery yourself. That way, you can rest assured that you get exactly the procedures that you want with the surgeon that you choose. Otherwise German insurance would decide all that for you based on money and not on your needs (as already happened: you are not &#39;male enough&#39; = zero money for you. And had they given you money then it would have been even worse, since they had referred you to an  unexperienced German surgeon).

This is about the OP’s surgery, and is not the place to have a go at Dr Bart for other people surgeries.

part 1:
</p>
<p>
Let me preface this review with my motivation. Though I had some quite prominent male-typical looks in my face that I owed to the, well..., male-typical bone structure underneath, especially square jaw area and embossed forehead and eyebrow bones, I never felt the &gt;&gt;need&lt;&lt; to do a FFS, as in if I would suffer severely from my facial looks. Transition was largely good to me: People treated me as woman, and whether they read me as transgender or not was largely irrelevant, as they treated me well. I even met my boyfriend and we were planning our marriage before my FFS. So why yet another surgery (especially since in the past 2 years I had done hair transplant, VFS, SRS, body feminization, and all that made me exhausted)? I guess, I wanted to be beautiful. Maybe vanity... But I transitioned &#34;later&#34;, and now in my 40s I&#39;m feeling the typical &#34;life-is-too-short&#34;-pressure to get most out of my life now. And I didn&#39;t want to regret years down the road that I was hesitant now. So, yeah, I pushed my self to go for it...
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Sometime last year (last September I think), I had the first consultaion with Dr. Bart. He is traveling to some cities around Europe every year for consultations, and I booked an appointment with him in Munich. There, he made pictures of my face, and, after telling him where I see my biggest pain-points - for me it was the square-typed jaw, he made two proposals for me, one that included every procedure he suggested for my face (forehead reconstruction, brow bones, jaws, chin, liplift and cheeks lipofilling) for 18K € and a &#34;budget&#34; one, that I asked for, which did not include forehead and brow bones, which was about 5-6K € less. He made preview pictures of both proposals and sent them to me via e-mail 1 - 2 weeks later, so I had everything I needed to decide. And I took my time and thought about it thorouhly, as, as I explained in the motivation preface, I never felt the dire need to do changes in my face. But when I finally decided for the surgery, I also decided for the &#34;complete&#34; package, and now, 2 months post-op, I&#39;m actually very happy about it. I mailed the clinic for a surgery date and got access to their surgery booking website. Everything is online from now on: surgery date booking, current payment state, current state of the required ducuments: a recent bloodwork and a panoramic x-ray of my lower face bones (mouth, jaw, chin area), it is expected to collect them from local doctors and upload. Also online, there is a timeplan, based on my surgery date, with all the &#34;details&#34;, like when to arrive at the clinic, at what date and time are my consultation with Dr. Bart, my surgery time, how long is the stay at the clinic etc.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
According to the timeplan we arrived to Antwerp by train. We, that&#39;s my best friend and me. She was accompanying me, and the clinic has rooms with two beds, so she could stay with me during our whole stay in the clinic. Some time after showing us our apartment room and organizational things were done (access key card etc.), I had a consultation with Dr. Bart. He made several pictures of my face in different angles, he went forth with measuring some key areas like jaw length and distance nose to lip, and he proceeded with explaining in more detail what he is planning to do and what surgical steps will be involved. This consultation meeting is opportunity to ask questions about the surgery, that was scheduled to happen next morning. My questions largely revolved around expected risks and what I have to care about post-op. As for the risks, in short, as in every surgery, many bad things can happen, but their probability renders them largely irrelevant for worrying. The most relevant risk, still very low in occurrences, was permanent nerve damage, which would result in permanent loss of feeling in the lower lip area. According to Dr. Bart, patients who had permanent nerve damage, could successfully adjust to live with it. The post-op care, luckily, is not so taxing compared to my past surgeries: Putting on some creams and waiting for the swelling to recede. Also, no sports and no lifting heavy things for the first 6 weeks and protecting the scars from too much exposure to direct sunlight for the first 6 months. After consultation, Petra, the &#34;good soul&#34; of the clinic, explained me the preparations for my surgery, I was expected to not eat from midnight on and to not drink at least 2 hours before surgery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Surgery morning arrived, I put on some provided clothes and waited, until a nurse took me to the surgery room. There, Dr. Bart and the anaesthesist were waiting. Little smalltalk, then I informed the anaesthesist, as I&#39;m expected to do for every anaesthesia past my VFS with Dr. Kim in Seoul, that my vocal cords are shortened and a typically female-sized tube should be used. That said, the anesthesia mask was put on me, I inhaled a little bit of the gas, and zzzz..., the next thing I remember was waking up in the wake up room. My face felt hot and tightly bound: I was wearing a cooling mask connected to a device that pumped very cold water into small tubes that the mask pressed tightly around my face. I couldn&#39;t see anything, as my eye area was also covered by cooling tubes. Cooling felt good and was much needed initially. I felt no pain, just light discomfort. Biggest challenge was &#34;killing time&#34;. Unfortunately, as time passed, either the pressure or the cooling of the mask caused severe pain on my teeth. It was a slow building up of constant pain impulses, which got stronger and stronger, to the point that I stared moaning. They immediately gave me painkillers (everything intravenous, as I couldn&#39;t open my mouth much, let alone swallow), and things went fine again, I could bear wearing the cooling mask. Some hours later, still in my bed, I was transported back to the apartment room, still wearing the mask and still connected to the cooling device. I was expected to wear the mask for the night and the following day. Unfortunately again, during nighttime I started getting severe pain on my teeth again. On the first night post-op there was a night nurse, and we got a bell button to press in case we needed help. My friend saw me having pains and pushed the button. The nurse came immediately, gave me painkillers again - though this time they didn&#39;t help much. So, the nurse instructed my friend to pause/unpause the cooling machine, and she put the mask off me, so my teeth could recover from pressure. She then put the mask back on, started cooling again, and she explained my friend how to put the mask off and on again and how to unlink the mask from the cooling device if needed, so my teeth can recover from time to time. So, I had little complications post-op, but clinic staff helped swiftly and my issues were dealt with properly.

part 2:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The second day post-op I could change to another face mask, which was easier to wear and had no cooling effect. This mask was intended to cover and maintain pressure onto the surgical site: forehead, jaws, chin. Slowly, I could leave my bed more and more often. Eating and drinking was a bit of a challenge: For drinking I needed a special cup, since my mouth couldn&#39;t open much and I had no feeling in the lower lip area. As for eating, only small pieces could enter my mouth, and immediately post-op chewing was difficult and little bit hurting. I was expected to eat only soft stuff like youghurt and soups or soft lasagnas, vegetables and so on. Everything to eat, for me and my best friend who accompanied me, was provided by the clinic: Every day, Petra provided several yoghurts, soft salads, soft cheese, cereals etc. for us, and usually for late afternoon she prepared warm meals for all of us in the clinic apartments. Speaking of all of us: the days post-op were a great opportunity to meet other patients from Dr. Bart and have an exchange of experiences. Some had only minor stuff done or corrected, they stayed only few days. Others, like me, had full FFS done, and also stayed for a full week. In the evenings, after lunch, we usually had nice chats together and sometimes played some game of chess. As days passed, I could also leave the clinic more and more often, so we went out exploring the neighborhood - scars covered with a headband, and we had some nice walks in nearby parks. Eating and drinking also continually became easier, chewing became easier, allowing for eating more solid food.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to the last day at the clinic: Final consultation with Dr. Bart, he removed the sutures (not a pleasant procedure, but also not really painful) and made post-op pictures, again, in different angles. Some final questions from my side regarding post-op care, and then it was time to say goodbye to Dr. Bart, the nurses, Petra and the other patients we met during our stay at 2pass. Besides a successful surgery, we had a very good time altogether. Travelling back after surgery was a non-issue, covering my face with a corona mask also wasn&#39;t problematic, maybe even a bit welcome, since my face was still quite swollen. I was told that it needs roundabout 3 weeks for most of the swelling to recede, at least 3 months to get a good grasp of what the final results will be and about one year where facial look is still developing. Back at home I&#39;m continuing my post-op care. For scars protection sunblocker and a hat are doing the job right now. And I noticed with new people I interact, that didn&#39;t know me pre-op: they absolutely don&#39;t read me as trans now - feels even a bit awkward thinking about telling them.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
One final word on the numbness: My lower lip was completely numb for the first month, and afterwards, the feeling came back very slowly. At the beginning it felt like a very weak tingling, by now, 2 months after, the nerve is mostly, but still not fully recovered. The forehead area around the scar had similar numbness and is also recovering slowly. At the beginning I was nervous about whether the numbness would recover at all or I was to expect permanent nerve damage. Luckily, I knew a few past patients from Dr. Bart and they reassured me that nerve recovering just takes many weeks, so I have to give it time - Dr. Bart also had explained me this, but still, it was good to hear from other patients too. So allow me to reassure you, the reader, if you are willing to undergo FFS and end up with numb feelings on parts of the face, you just have to give it much much time, but eventually, things will be alright.

If you were charged for a type 3 forehead reconstruction, are you able to verify, with scans, that it is actually what you received?
</p>
<p>
The biggest issue with Bart, and the reason he&#39;s in legal hot water, is that he lied to a bunch of patients and performed type 2 forehead reconstruction instead, which is a simpler procedure, which should cost less. He also filled sinus cavities with bone cement, causing serious pain at high altitudes for his patients, and affecting their voices in some niche situations.

To the time being, no, I can&#39;t verify that with scans. My view on this always was, that I payed for a feminine face, and if you cannot verify from my after picture what procedure was used and need scans instead, why actually bother so much? I had the same with body feminization, that I had done in Germany: the surgeon suggested implant forms and sizes, he told me though, that he can only decide on the actual best fit during the surgery. After surgery he told me, what exactly he decided for. That said, post-op, Dr. Bart hasn&#39;t told me anything about having done type 2 forehead instead of type 3. Imagining that he had performed type 2 on me instead, it is still hard to accuse him for anything more besides not telling me: If he achieves same good looks with a procedure that is simpler, less invasive, which is thus less prone to risks and complications and less taxing on my body and the healing, isn&#39;t it actually an advantage? You see, it is a major surgery, and as with all surgeries, it is by far not all about the money. Had he known before surgery that type 2 suffices and he charged me for type 3, that would indeed be malpractice. But then again, how should I know that? In the end, it is a matter of whether you trust the surgeon or not.

This. It&#39;s hard to trust a surgeon who will just do whatever he wants which is unethical and illegal plus often times he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing or what is necessary or not. And the damages he causes are always permanent.

Trust is very important. I trusted Dr. Bart fully, and I&#39;m completely happy with my results, so, naturally, I recommend him based on &gt;&gt;my&lt;&lt; experience. If you don&#39;t trust him however, you definitely should not go there for surgery, look for a surgeon you feel better with instead. This can&#39;t be emphasized enough.

The reduction on the jaw and chin is too much. I would get a CBCT scan if I were you and ask to check the state of the mental nerves and ID nerves and canal. With that much reduction he has likely cut the nerves and he does it all the time. Your lower lip also rolled in it seems and now puckers. Do you have screws in your chin? If so ask to check if they are impinging on your roots too.

I don&#39;t understand... my FFS was 2 months ago. I waited that time to see the results and base my AMA and review on them. Same as I did last year with my SRS AMA. I got no payment or discount for writing it, just want to be helpful and share my experiences to people who are interested in this surgery. If you feel, Dr. Bart buthered you, then by all means, write your own review and provide pictures too, but please don&#39;t attack my AMA.
