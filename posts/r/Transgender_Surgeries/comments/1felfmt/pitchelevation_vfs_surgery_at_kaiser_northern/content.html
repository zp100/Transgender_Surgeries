TLDR; Voice training didn’t fully work for me as a trans feminine person so I sought voice feminization (VFS) surgery at Kaiser Northern California.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon, Dr. Nancy Jiang, brought me into feminine pitch range, pretty much nuking my voice dysphoria.  Six months postop: new pitch stable, no complications, over-the-moon happy.
</p>
<p>
The surgical procedure, Wendler glottoplasty, is popular, safe as surgeries go and relatively effective but it commonly has trade-offs, which I experienced. And positive outcomes are not as consistent as they are for vaginoplasty and breast augmentation. It’s not a cure-all for the effects of the wrong puberty on the female voice and it is not a replacement for voice therapy.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser’s NW region (Washington, Oregon) offers VFS to members. The much larger Kaiser Northern and Southern California regions are working on doing so. IDK its status in the other regions.
</p>
<p>
This post is long, and intended for Kaiser California members who may want Wendler glottoplasty or anyone wanting a somewhat deep dive into the procedure. For those seeking only a quick overview of it, I’ve put a brief summary at the end.
</p>
<p>
I hope this will help those in any Kaiser region who need VFS to get it. Feel free to AMA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Why VFS
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Some trans feminine people who went through male puberty are happy with their voice. Some are happy with voice training alone. And some seek surgery.
</p>
<p>
After about two years of voice training with Kaiser speech-language pathologists (SLPs, i.e., voice therapists), I could not reliably maintain a feminine pitch.
</p>
<p>
They had given me the tools to succeed, safely, at sounding feminine. And after a few months I did. My problem was, I couldn’t sustain it. And that caused me significant distress in my daily life.
</p>
<p>
Without consistent higher pitch I couldn’t fully concentrate on the other aspects of a feminine voice they had taught me such as resonance, musicality and intonation, articulation, emphasis via pitch rather than volume, etc. Worse, my pitch would slide back into an androgynous/masculine voice a lot of the time, especially when tired, distracted, nervous, or just engrossed in conversation with friends.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
VFS research:  Wendler glottoplasty is safe and relatively effective
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Trans people I’m friends with IRL had warned me against VFS, citing people they knew or had heard about who were unhappy with it. Another friend knew a woman for whom it was a success. Posts on Reddit from those who’ve had it recount disappointing as well as positive experiences.
</p>
<p>
In healthcare outcomes, individual case reports matter to the individual and may matter generally. Large numbers of individual case reports matter because they can surface trends that help drive better outcomes for many.
</p>
<p>
I used PubMed (a database of medical journal abstracts hosted by the National Library of Medicine) to identify about 50 medical journal articles from about 2013-2023 reporting on VFS outcomes for about 1,000 patients, the overwhelming number transfeminine. I downloaded and read the full articles from
<a href="/r/scihub">r/scihub</a>
and other sources.
</p>
<p>
The two VFS procedures that surfaced the most in my PubMed searches were Wendler glottoplasty and cricothyroid approximation. They are quite distinct and surgeons may vary the technique they use for them (e.g., Kim, 2020).
</p>
<p>
What I found in my review was fewer complications and higher F0 over time for Wendler glottoplasty than cricothyroid approximation. (F0 is fundamental frequency, the perception of our speech sounds as high or low; Hirst and De Looze, 2021.)
</p>
<p>
Wendler glottoplasty involves de-epithelializing and then joining together via suture, adhesive, or both, the anterior third to half of the two vocal folds producing speech, thereby creating a new structure: a glottic web.
</p>
<p>
In reducing the folds’ vibrating length the surgery places greater tension on them and thus raises the frequency of sounds as air moves past them.
</p>
<p>
Wendler glottoplasty does not directly alter the resonating chambers of the larynx and supralaryngeal vocal tract so it typically does not affect resonance.
</p>
<p>
In digging deeper on PubMed into Wendler glottoplasty outcomes I found it to be popular, safe as surgeries go, and generally effective judging by recorded vocal measurements pre- and postop and by patient satisfaction scores on the Trans Woman Voice Questionnaire (TWVQ). Dwyer et al. (2023) call it the “present gold standard” for VFS.
</p>
<p>
I ruled out cricothyroid approximation mostly because Wendler glottoplasty is less invasive, meaning less risk of complications and a relatively easier recovery as well as my perception of Wendler glottoplasty having better outcomes.
</p>
<p>
There are also frequently reported trade-offs about Wendler glottoplasty. These can include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
reduced output acoustic power (loudness and/or phonation time),
</li>
<li>
reduced frequency range,
</li>
<li>
hoarseness, i.e., any deterioration in voice quality, usually characterized as roughness (Stinnett, 2018). Roughness has been defined as a perceived irregularity in voicing source (Reghunathan and Bryson, 2019) and as a harshness “induced by particular sound qualities (i.e., dissonance)” (Di Stefano, 2022).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The magnitude of these negative effects differs by patient and may improve with postop healing and/or voice training.
</p>
<p>
From the TWVQ scores in the PubMed articles, most seem to find these trade-offs acceptable. But they can be unacceptable to others, including performers like singers and actors--really anyone whose work could unduly stress the vocal folds (Guss et al., 2014).
</p>
<p>
I judged the trade-offs acceptable to me given my needs and the likely benefits of surgery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pushing for Wendler glottoplasty at Kaiser Northern California
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Kaiser is a large healthcare provider with HMO and PPO plans in several U.S. states. I’m a member of Kaiser Northern California.
</p>
<p>
At least one other Kaiser region offers VFS: Kaiser NW (Washington, Oregon). It’s published a voice modification surgery UR (utilization review):
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/content/dam/kporg/final/documents/health-plan-documents/coverage-information/clinical-review-gender-affirming-voice-modification-surgery-nw.pdf">https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/content/dam/kporg/final/documents/health-plan-documents/coverage-information/clinical-review-gender-affirming-voice-modification-surgery-nw.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>
A UR specifies a healthcare service in a way a provider can use to allocate the resources needed to deliver it, whether it’s professional staff, equipment, facilities, and/or referrals to out-of-network providers with the expertise to perform a procedure or service when that capability doesn’t exist in network, as used to happen at Kaiser Northern California for vaginoplasty and still does AFAIK for electrolysis. It can include, as this one does, a referral process for the surgery and medical necessity criteria to justify offering the procedure to the patient.
</p>
<p>
At Kaiser, a published UR is de facto evidence of coverage for a specific procedure. Its stated purpose is to help ensure patients receive consistent and equitable care. The Kaiser regions in California have not published a UR for VFS.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser Northern California has told its voice therapists to tell patients it does not offer VFS. That’s what they told me, more than once. I decided to try to get Kaiser Northern California to offer Wendler glottoplasty to me anyway, and hopefully for others.
</p>
<p>
As it turned out, my request for surgery helped spur the physicians at Kaiser Northern and Southern California to form an interregional committee to create a clinical pathway for VFS so that these two Kaiser regions can offer it to patients if it’s medically necessary. A clinical pathway is a formal first step to providing a procedure.
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t the first to have VFS at Kaiser Northern California. A small number of other patients have had it, too.
</p>
<p>
Until a clinical pathway and UR are actually implemented (see below for status as of this writing), perhaps what I did may work for you.
</p>
<p>
In late 2022, I asked my voice therapist to document my continued dysphoria around my voice.
</p>
<p>
It took a while before I resolved to try to push for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
When I did, I decided my next step would be to ask a Kaiser gender therapist to document my distress in detail, with the object being to have a record for an appeal after I was refused surgery.
</p>
<p>
It then took about a month to get a video visit in mid-August 2023. I chose a video visit rather than a phone call because patients typically have more time with the therapist and because seeing helps foster empathy.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to make my distress as real to Kaiser as it was for me.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, I gave the therapist detailed instances (time, place, how others reacted, how I felt, etc.) of the hurt I suffered from speaking in public, at work, on the phone, and with friends. I included how these events had negatively impacted my life and prevented the things I had needed to do. Some of these experiences were so hurtful when they happened, I still remember them vividly years later. This may have been the single most important thing to help persuade Kaiser to offer me the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The gender therapist sent the notes of our meeting to my primary care physician (PCP) right away, and I was lucky enough to snag an in-person appointment with them that week to underscore my need, summarizing what I had told the gender and voice therapists.
</p>
<p>
By the next day my PCP had endorsed my request with the supporting documentation from the gender and voice therapists to Kaiser’s ENT (ear, nose, and throat) department in Oakland.
</p>
<p>
There I figured my request would end. But a few days later they called to schedule a surgical consultation.
</p>
<p>
About a month after that, in September 2023, I was face-to-face with Dr. Nancy Jiang, chair of Kaiser Northern California’s Department of Head and Neck Surgery (it would have been sooner but I couldn’t commit to an offered earlier date).
</p>
<p>
She was experienced at performing Wendler glottoplasty and the medical journal articles she had co-authored about it, including a meta-analysis, had surfaced in my PubMed search (see, e.g., Song and Jiang, 2017).
</p>
<p>
She had already reviewed my medical history and the therapists’ notes.
</p>
<p>
At our visit she examined my larynx via nasal laryngoscopy, captured some still photos, cleared me medically for having surgery, and explained the procedure.
</p>
<p>
We discussed the current state of the art in pitch-elevation surgery. She confirmed my assessment of the literature, suggested I read the work of a former colleague of hers, Dr. Mark Courey at Mt. Sinai, and noted three cautionary points about Wendler glottoplasty:
</p>
<p>
(1) There are not a lot of reported outcomes in peer-reviewed medical journals greater than 1 year (including from the provider with the most surgeries, the Yeson Voice Center in South Korea).
</p>
<p>
This matters because the glottic web created during the procedure needs to maintain its integrity in order to raise F0. The absence of long-term reports makes the procedure’s efficacy less known over time given that web may suffer disease (e.g., polyps), trauma from impact or irritants, and will be subject to aging as all tissue is.
</p>
<p>
(2 Post-procedure dysphonic vocal qualities like roughness are not well reported, and
</p>
<p>
(3) The location for stitch placement is not as well understood as it should be.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, she said longer-term positive outcomes for Wendler glottoplasty are not as certain as they are for some gender-affirming surgeries like breast augmentation and vaginoplasty, and therefore a positive outcome was not guaranteed for me (which she reminded me of in the perioperative prep area shortly before surgery when I asked her about the surgical plan).
</p>
<p>
I said I understood these risks and wanted a week to think about it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Developing a clinical pathway for VFS at Kaiser California
</strong>
</p>
<p>
A week later I asked for the surgery. Kaiser then put me in a holding pattern while it formed a committee to develop a clinical pathway for this procedure.
</p>
<p>
A clinical pathway helps reduce risk and optimize outcomes for a group of patients by ensuring adherence to evidence-based standards throughout a clinical process, including patient- and group-specific protocols such as medical necessity and appropriateness, mitigating risk, appropriate timeframes and criteria for recovery, as well as optimizing resource utilization (e.g., staffing, facilities, supplies like surgical and diagnostic instruments) by the provider.
</p>
<p>
The intent of the pathway is to help make this procedure safer and provide a way for Kaiser Northern California to be able to offer Wendler glottoplasty or potentially other gender-affirming voice procedures to those for whom it’s medically appropriate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Wendler glottoplasty surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
About four months later, even as the clinical pathway was still in development, I was given a surgery date.
</p>
<p>
Before it I met with a Kaiser Oakland voice therapist who recorded my maximum phonation time; my pitch and intensity, having me read a passage, describe a picture, and speak extemporaneously; and then take a resonance test. And I filled out the Trans Woman Voice Questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
Surgery was at Kaiser’s Richmond hospital three weeks later, at the end of March 2024.
</p>
<p>
The hospital is old but clean. I walked myself into the large OR, trailing my IV pole with its bag of Ringer’s solution but no sedatives. This would be my fifth surgery under general anesthesia and I’d found that foregoing pre-op sedatives helped me recover a bit faster.
</p>
<p>
I was under anesthesia for about 1.5 hours, and spent about 1.25 hours in recovery. I like that for every procedure Kaiser had someone sitting quietly at my bedside as I woke.
</p>
<p>
My sister drove me home and despite her suggesting I recover at her place—which would have been safer because that first night I was still a bit woozy and at elevated, if small, risk for stroke (general anesthesia usually takes two-to-three days to be eliminated from the body). But I wanted to recover by myself to avoid any temptation to speak. She thoughtfully brought soft foods like applesauce and chocolate puddings for me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery signs and symptoms
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The first injunction in the discharge instructions was two weeks of complete vocal rest.
</p>
<p>
In spite of reading on this sub of the experiences of those who’ve gone through it, it was harder than I’d anticipated (not difficult, just annoying), even though I stayed home by myself as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
After the two weeks, the discharge instructions said I should speak up to 10 min./hr. (that turned out to be optimistic), and not to whisper, sing or shout until four-to-six weeks postop or until they say it’s OK to do. Also to stay well hydrated and to avoid gargling or clearing my throat.
</p>
<p>
I kept glasses of water handy to stifle any incipient coughs. I did not buy a steam inhaler as recommended in the discharge instructions for alleviating discomfort. Also no nebulizer for misting my throat with anesthesia. I considered these but figured my somewhat high pain tolerance would see me through, and I was right.
</p>
<p>
Nothing in the discharge instructions about the many spicy foods I like, but I had the sense to avoid them. Caffeine I didn’t avoid and it irritated my throat a bit.
</p>
<p>
Discomfort was like the mother of all sore throats in duration, but not in pain. Fairly constant pain level 1 to 3, reducing in about a week to intermittent pain level 1 or below. I managed fine with Tylenol 500 mg. caplets 5 X/day. I stopped Tylenol day 4 postop. Throughout recovery I swallowed 10 ml. of Robitussin as a prophylactic against coughs.
</p>
<p>
N.B.: We all experience pain differently so YMMV.
</p>
<p>
I had made a pocket-sized laminated sign “Just had surgery. Unable to speak.” It proved handy in slowing down the world while whoever it was I interacted with when I was out and about scrutinized it while I typed out what I needed to say on my phone. I kept my sign next to my Covid mask to make it easy to whip out, and I masked more often in public to reduce the chances of catching a cold that could make healing more uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Although I successfully suppressed almost all coughs and sneezes during those two weeks I let slip a few words almost each day, albeit not putting enough volume behind them to upset my vocal folds much. Dr. Jiang had said that if I had, it would only have delayed healing.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks postop my first words at normal volume were “hello world” and then reading at normal speaking volume a brief passage from a book. After which my vocal folds rebelled and for the next 3 or 4 days I’d get hoarse after just speaking just one sentence, accompanied by pain level 1 to 2.
</p>
<p>
I had wanted to speak up to 10 min./hr. as Kaiser’s discharge instructions recommended, but my throat would get too sore too quickly for that. The surgeon had said that was normal and to stop at any sign of discomfort but otherwise to continue speaking each day. The folds are in part muscle, after all, and muscles can benefit by exercise.
</p>
<p>
There were no exercise restrictions otherwise so I resumed my daily walks, including my city’s hills, the day after the surgery.
</p>
<p>
It was a gradual recovery, a slow improvement almost every day: a little less hoarseness and a little less pain and longer bouts of speaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Follow-up visits with surgeon
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
3 weeks postop
</em>
</p>
<p>
Nasal laryngoscopy showed a healthy looking anterior glottic web with some mucous, vocal folds swollen but abducting (opening) normally although with an anterior glottal gap on modal phonation (the folds near the web not closing completely as they need to during normal speech sounds).
</p>
<p>
<em>
8 weeks postop
</em>
</p>
<p>
Nasal laryngoscopy showed that the stitches had almost entirely dissolved, swelling was minimal and the anterior glottal gap on modal phonation largely but not completely resolved.
</p>
<p>
Also, pain after an hour or so of conversation was noticeable only as a little tightness. And the tightness I experienced waking up no longer occurred each morning.
</p>
<p>
<em>
5.5 months postop
</em>
</p>
<p>
Would have been sooner but Covid intervened.
</p>
<p>
This time the photos showed the anterior glottal gap almost completely resolved. It’s still visible but doesn’t affect voice and is probably still healing. Both folds, the glottic web, and surrounding tissue looked healthy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre- and postop frequency measurements
</strong>
</p>
<p>
According to the Voice Tools app on my phone, when reading that passage from my book when I had just ended vocal rest, my pitch had gone from 194.6 Hz pre-op when I was making the effort—as I had been taught in voice training—to elevate my pitch for speech, to 216.7 Hz postop when I wasn’t consciously making an effort. Five weeks postop, pitch for that passage was 215.6 Hz. At 6 months postop it was 216.1 Hz.
</p>
<p>
At my first follow up with Kaiser’s voice therapist five weeks postop, she measured mean F0 for reading a text, when I may have been making an effort to consciously raise pitch, was 215.59 Hz, and extemporaneous speaking, when I was wasn’t making an effort to raise pitch, was 208.18 Hz.
</p>
<p>
That’s within the range for cis females (180-220 Hz, Dwyer 2023, 77, though this range varies by author). Pitch often falls later in the day when we’re tired.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Trade-offs and downsides
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Here are the downsides I’ve experienced:
</p>
<p>
(1) Some non-speech sounds (like coughing) as well as sotto voce speech and whispers, seem unchanged in pitch, though others (laughing, clearing my throat, sighing, yawning) are higher pitched. I hadn’t anticipated this but should have as that&#39;s how vocal folds work: air has to be pushed past them to create pitch.
</p>
<p>
(2) My phonation time decreased almost 25 percent by the SLP’s measure. That hasn’t created any limitations in talking but could if I needed to sustain a note in singing. Intensity is unchanged. For conversation in moderately noisy environments like restaurants I’ve had to remember to speak a bit louder. But acquiring that as a habit was easy.
</p>
<p>
(3) Maximum loudness may be down but by how much I don’t know as the voice therapist cautioned against stressing the vocal folds and I’d never measured this before. But at week 10 postop I had no trouble briefly speaking outdoors in a fairly quiet environment to about 50 people. Tested brief yelling: pitch was high and voice clear but how loud IDK.
</p>
<p>
(4) Speech was rough for several weeks, the roughness reducing with healing. At postop week 3 the surgeon estimated mildly rough, grade 2 on a 15-point GRBAS scale (Grade: Roughness Breathiness Aesthenia Strain; like TWVQ a subjective measure).  The voice therapist noticed no roughness in our final session week 8 postop and I’ve noticed none in classroom settings (week 11).
</p>
<p>
Again, we all heal differently so YMMV.
</p>
<p>
As the owner of a new glottic web I was worried about being intubated for an upcoming BA. The surgeon said not to be, as it’s now just a part of my anatomy and an intubation wouldn’t damage it with anything less than an “insane” amount of force against it. That’s reassuring, but I’ll ask the anesthesiologist to go easy anyway.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Outcome
</strong>
</p>
<p>
My pitch is higher routinely, without having to consciously think about it, judging by what I hear and from what people have said.
</p>
<p>
Having my pitch dialed in means I no longer worry about my voice being perceived as masculine.
</p>
<p>
Misgendering on the phone is a thing of the past, which is huge for me, perhaps the biggest benefit in alleviating my voice dysphoria. Woo-wooing at events or shouting “brava!” at the opera is euphoric.
</p>
<p>
I can still access lower frequencies but have to make an effort to do so, and it sounds artificial.
</p>
<p>
When I emphasize words, I naturally go high. But I still have to remember to focus on resonance and musicality.
</p>
<p>
All this has helped me feel more confident about speaking and has been a significant boost to my overall confidence and happiness. My TWVQ score went from 75 to 39 (lower is happier).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Kaiser California’s clinical pathway completed but not implemented
</strong>
</p>
<p>
As of now (mid-September, 2024) the clinical pathway for VFS at Kaiser’s Northern and Southern California regions is completed but not yet implemented.
</p>
<p>
Kaiser’s two California regions have about 8.5 million members. That would include a large number who may benefit from VFS. Both regions have committed to implement the pathway to offer VFS to those for whom it’s medically appropriate. Remaining steps include training the SLPs and allocating surgical resources, including referrals to outside surgeons if needed.
</p>
<p>
I’d speculate Kaiser Northern and Southern California will offer VFS by Q1 or Q2 2025. This is only my  somewhat-educated guess.
</p>
<p>
Until Kaiser has published a formal referral process, any Kaiser Northern and Southern California members interested in having this procedure should ask their SLP about it. PCPs, gender therapists and other providers at Kaiser may not be as up-to-date on the latest plans.
</p>
<p>
There’s another factor: U.S. politics. Given the current far-right majority on our Supreme Court, Republican victories in the presidency and Congress could severely restrict or end most gender-affirming healthcare in the U.S. Accordingly, I urge anyone seeking gender-affirming surgery in the U.S. to try to have it sooner than later.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
If you’re considering VFS
</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you’ve read this far, you’ll know that pitch-elevation surgery isn’t for everyone. You should think as to whether it would be necessary and appropriate for you in alleviating your dysphoria, and consider its trade-offs.
</p>
<p>
If you do want a more feminine voice and haven’t done so already, consider seeking out a trans-competent SLP. They can help you train your voice safely and efficiently. If you pursue surgery, your sessions with an SLP before and perhaps after will help ensure a better outcome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
SUMMARY
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Kaiser offers VFS in its NW region and is working on offering one type of it, Wendler glottoplasty, in Northern and Southern California. Wendler glottoplasty is the current gold standard for pitch elevation surgery. It is safe and relatively effective at raising pitch but that’s all it does. It can help alleviate gender dysphoria but it has common trade-offs such as reduced frequency range, loudness, and phonation time. Its outcomes are not as consistently positive as for BA and bottom surgery. Voice therapy, ideally with a trans-competent SLP, should be tried first and will help ensure a better surgical outcome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Thanks
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m grateful to everyone who’s posted about their experiences having VFS. I found these two posts especially useful because they helped me better know what to ask myself, and thus what to say to the gender therapist about my dysphoria, and in how to prepare for recovery:
