There&#39;s no &#34;right&#34; path to being trans*, only your path. You do you, and if it feels off, then adjust the course and try something new. Don&#39;t ever let someone convince you that you have to do something that doesn&#39;t feel right. Experiment, and go at your pace. You&#39;ll know what is right for you. Best wishes to you!

Iâ€™m so glad you posted this! I feel the same way, I have body contouring booked for august and I just donâ€™t feel comfortable dressing and presenting female with this manly body and proportions and Iâ€™ve begun to get super anxious because I have to see a therapist to get a letter and Iâ€™m worried about her not taking me seriously so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s strange. maybe weâ€™re just perfectionists lol

Hehe you might be right. Yes that&#39;s exactly my problem. Since going onto HRT 3 years ago I have only tried makeup once... bought some female clothes but never tried them on. I just dont feel ready, not until I have the body that I want first. For me that&#39;s FFS, body contouring and breast surgery. Once all that&#39;s done then I will finally be ready to take the biggest step to living how I want to be for rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
But yes I cant possibly find comfort with all of these masculine features showing. It seems strange but I have to remove and delete that part of my appearance first.

Nah not strange. Totally relatable lol I will say makeup is hard sis start practicing now!!!! Iâ€™ve ordered all the necessary things to do a full face and Iâ€™ve been practicing here alone at home but the practice has helped. donâ€™t be afraid to live the fantasy behind closed doors lol square body and all I be in my little dress covering up this beard at my little vanity station in the bathroom a couple nights a week. just for practice. I usually breakdown near tears cause then I just see a man wearing makeup buuuuuuuuuuuuuut practice makes perfect and after I start getting work done the last thing I want is to still have patchy eyeshadow and crooked eyeliner lmao

I wasnâ€™t in boy mode but when I started having procedures I certainly didnâ€™t pass and I never forced a feminine appearance if it wasnâ€™t there. Over the past 2 years my appearance had migrated slowly fem. I tossed all my boy clothes at about 6 months HRT and opted for a light makeup look with androgynous female clothes. Still not happy with the results but feel way more comfortable in my own skin.
</p>
<p>
I showed up to my Orchi in sweatpants, a t shirt, no makeup, no hair products, no wigs, I certainly looked like a guy.

My anxiety had got the best of me many years ago. I used a simple Philosophy: Confronting and trying to find self-acceptance with gender dysphoria should work To make you more comfortable with yourself. I personally wouldnâ€™t wear womensâ€™ clothing unless I was more comfortable in womenâ€™s clothing, and that for me required having people make me feel more uncomfortable wearing menâ€™s clothes than womenâ€™s. I didnâ€™t think that day was possible. Taking hormones on and off since I first learned their potential at age 24, I change to taking them daily at age 29. By age 31, especially after removing my facial hair with laser ( my body hair disappeared and redistributed itself in some new ways), I was greeted and treated as a woman despite trying to keep my male facade. I was seen as a â€˜Tom-boyâ€™ by many, treated as if a lesbian (usually my people that are angry and homophobic), and my family didnâ€™t know what to think. At this point, I tried simple womenâ€™s clothes fitted for a womanâ€™s shape, which fit well, and I had little to no issues. At that point, I started reinventing my wardrobe. I donâ€™t have drastic facial issues, but they still bother me and I am self conscious about them, but Iâ€™m not able to afford FFS. Regardless, other people see me how I wish and â€˜boy-modeâ€™ is now what would Cause discomfort.

Been on HRT for 2.5 years, and have bottom surgery scheduled for the end of September. No plans to shift to a more femme presentation unless / until I feel I can pass (or can no longer pull off boymode at all).
