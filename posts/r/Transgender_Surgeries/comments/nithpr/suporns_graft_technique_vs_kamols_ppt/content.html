So I’m booked in with Suporn for scrotal srs, but I’m starting to wonder if PPT with Kamol might have been a better idea? I’ve wanted to go to Suporn for years but the emergence of PPT has been playing on my mind recently. I think that aesthetically Suporns SRS results look better than Kamols, but then again it must be nice to have a self lubricating vagina, it’s such a dilemma. Somebody did post a video of their PPT result with Kamol and the positioning seemed off, like it was too high towards the navel.
</p>
<p>
If anybody could weigh in with their opinions/knowledge I would be grateful.

I&#39;m also planning to go with Suporn, and I&#39;ve had similar thoughts about maybe going PPT. Obviously having a mucosal lining would be nice, but the Suporn canals I&#39;ve seen have all looked nice and pink, which is my main concern with a skin-lined canal. There hasn&#39;t been much research on what happens to neovaginal lining over time, but there seems to be some evidence that the skin at least changes slightly in texture (which makes sense, it&#39;s being put into a moist environment 24/7). That is, while scrotal grafts won&#39;t lubricate besides fluid from the Cowper&#39;s gland, the people who&#39;ve gotten them report that they aren&#39;t at all dry (there was a girl on here about a month ago who answered a ton of questions about her SRS with Suporn, and basically confirmed that the canal was pink, moist, and not really too different from a cis lining).
</p>
<p>
I also think it depends on your priorities. For me personally, I&#39;m prioritizing the external appearance over having a mucosal lining. Some people prioritize the mucosal lining, which is perfectly okay too. We all have different goals from this surgery. I&#39;m personally also more comfortable with scrotal grafts/PI since they&#39;re much more well-researched, and they also leave PPT
<em>
and
</em>
colonovaginoplasty as revision options in case the primary fails. I&#39;d personally rather utilize all of the already existing tissue before dipping into other parts of my body (you can always do that later, but you can never get back tissue that was discarded during the initial SRS). Hopefully my own thought process on this matter can be of some use to you!

It&#39;s definitely a difficult choice. Where&#39;d you hear it was an easier recovery though? I thought it would be more intense since it&#39;s a longer surgery and they&#39;re operating on your internal organs.
</p>
<p>
I almost feel like some PPT surgeons waste tissue though, I still personally think Suporn has some of the best aesthetics despite using scrotal tissue in the canal.

I think that Katiebresh means that with PPT you don’t have to dialate very much compared to scrotal.

Ahh okay that makes sense. I&#39;d be a bit careful with that assumption though, I haven&#39;t heard any surgeons say this (and Wittenberg specifically stated that she doesn&#39;t recommend PPT patients dilate any less)

Yes Suporns results look amazing, better than Kamols anyway IMO, although some results on Kamols website look quite good. I saw one of Kamols results from a video that was sent to me by the patient herself. It looked too high towards the navel, like some of the older 1990‘s results. I don’t know. I’m still leaning towards Suporn and I’m booked it so I’ll probably go ahead but the lack of photos of Kamols results make it more difficult to decide.

Yeah definitely. Another main concern with Kamol is the fact that he&#39;s sent people to advertise on his behalf without disclosure in this sub, which I personally find really shady. I&#39;d have a hard time trusting a surgeon that does that. Kamol&#39;s labia minora also tend to end quite abruptly before the vaginal introitus, but to be fair he&#39;s far from the only surgeon to do that.

Hey there, did you get the Video from Darcie? Cause I got a video too and I also think it’s way to high.

Darcie that works for Kamol? Gets paid for bringing in patients? Not sue it’s a good idea putting too much trust in things like that.

I don’t want to offer an opinion since I moderate here and prefer to help people be informed. There’s a wiki here with information on surgeons. Here’s the Thailand page

<p>
If you’re on Facebook I have noticed that there’s a lot of marketing for Kamol there, and he’s talked about way out of proportion to how well known he is outside of Facebook. It appears very biased.

I did, and I agree it&#39;s far too high. Although I got another video from her and the positioning seemed a litter better.

I got that 2nd video too and it looks much better, I think with time it will get lower. Are you still with Suporn or did you change your mind? X

If self lubing is your only reason then don&#39;t discount Suporn, I self lube plenty when turned on, almost enough to not need any lube at all.

I presume that you had srs with Suporn? Can I ask how the inside of your vagina feels compared to a cis vagina?

Definitely not as stretchy, that&#39;s for sure, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever get a comparative texture, most cis vaginas that I&#39;ve explored (lol) have very sponge like flesh a few cm in, especially at the front of the canal. Mine is just very wet and smooth all the way in.
</p>
<p>
Ooh yes, make sure to get the perineum lasered before going or you&#39;ll have hair in the entrance.

Thanks for sharing! Do you think the difference is that noticeable, or does it feel like it could fall in the range of natal anatomy?

Nah, I think the tightness is the only noticeable thing and that can be remedied with some dilation, unfortunately it&#39;s quite painful to do that though.

Thank you, Sister! May I kindly know how the scar near the Vagina is? Will they disappear? As I have done the full Bikini laser, no hair down there anymore; I really worry that I will have a nice suporn’s vagina and visible scar on the side with no pubic hair to cover. Thank you for your experiences and advice.

I wouldn&#39;t say that there&#39;s really a scar, just a transition from different skin textures.

I’m booking with Kamol for scrotal graft in October. I’ve heard a lot of people extremely happy with his results. And he’s affordable $10,500 US dollars. Once I have surgery and if I’m not happy I can get PPT in The US under my insurance since I’ll be Female.

I had PPV with Kamol on April 4th, Results o.k not much depth, around 4 inches max, and I have had a continuous UTI which I don´t know is still a consequence of surgery. Aesthetics are pretty good, I`m not a vagina expert but it seems o.k to me.
