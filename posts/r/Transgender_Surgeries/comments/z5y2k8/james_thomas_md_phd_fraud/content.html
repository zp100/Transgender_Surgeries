This serves more or less as a significant warning on the level as The Butcher, Bart Van De Ven.
</p>
<p>
James P Thomas of Portland Oregon responsible for the Femlar procedure often does not even perform the surgery. It depends largely on if he likes you or if he believes he can gaslight you. I even made the mistake of telling him I was scammed before in a face and voice surgery so nondoubt my intent to be open and trusting with him made me a clear mark. I have seen similar reports of &#34;non change&#34; in vocal quality before and after, and like me he certainly attempts to gaslight you despite evidence that you may still sound masculine from friends family and peers. Such was my experience. In short I&#39;ll outline the main problems and I can answer any questions in the comments. Started with a vocal ranged between C3 and C5, with a very male resonance. Post op my range is C3 and C5 after two &#34;aggressive&#34; surgeries. So to highlight what happened.
</p>
<p>
The first surgery was the female, promised to be a significant change with &#34;even over 40% vocal cord length removed&#34; After surgery there was little pain beyond the neck incision, slight hoarseness from swelling but no change in voice and could speak almost immediately. Zero change even though I was told the pitch would be clear and immediate even then. Voice recovered within the week but I avoided using it as much as possible for even a full month. No change, no pain. Same voice Mistaken for male on the phone and on test sites such as Omegle, strangers are a much more reliable source especially if you don&#39;t look trans, they&#39;ll tell you if you sound like a guy. And 10/10 times even without using a camera people thought I was trans or male. Not so to doctor Thomas, no the change was immediate and dramatic and couldn&#39;t believe how feminine i sounded. Typical formula used to gaslight trans patients, but not connected to reality. Second surgery, then I&#39;ll get to the independent findings from both. Was promised to be another aggressive surgery, a CO2 lasering procedure. With his very own pharynx reduction procedure which (no patients have ever given feedback on, with retrospect another lie of omission on his part as doubtless the feedback was as negative as mine. If he tells you he has never had feedback on it, beware) I think we know how this went. No voice for about a month, voice returned identical, some pitch instability during the rest of the 6 week healing phase then back to, yep you guessed it C3 to C5 range. Unchanged resonance. Dr telling me it was a huge success.
</p>
<p>
So what did the independent scope find? Using the footages he provided me to get a second opinion (only given I might add after I suggested I couldn&#39;t get a 2nd opinion until sept 2023, putting it just over the 2 year statute of limitations in Portland) It was seen that no reduction in larynx size was present between either, if any vocal cord length reduction had even taken place it was less than &#34;5%&#34;, all landmarks along the vocal cords were still present, blood vessel patterns etc etc. No suspension if the larynx, still in same position as before the surgery. The audio recordings? No change, capable of same range a before. Still perceived as male.
</p>
<p>
Second surgery findings? A complete sham. The vocal cords had not been reduced in size or bulk, and the pharynx was not reduced, what had been done instead is a single slit cut into the pharynx wall with sutures applied.
</p>
<p>
What I cannot fathom is the lengths gone to to make it seem genuine when they could have done what they promised for the same amount of effort. I&#39;m sure some people have a good experience there but if anything that&#39;s even worse if he isn&#39;t just incompetent itmeanshe is picking and choosing patients to provide quality of care to and robbing the rest of us. Playing favourites with who walks through his door.
</p>
<p>
Suffice it to say that after providing the evidence and requesting a refund, we have no heard from them since and we are 8 unanswered emails down.
</p>
<p>
We reported him to the Oregon medical board and sent in the evidence and report, and I will upload all evidence on a later post as soon as it&#39;s collated to give you something beyond my warnings. I&#39;m after all a strange woman on the internet.
</p>
<p>
But in the meantime please do your own research on this man before you jump into things, I know there is a surgeon in Australia who does the same surgery but I&#39;m not sure about them as I&#39;ve not had time to research them myself.
</p>
<p>
Like so many others I thought James was going to be the symbol of hope I was looking for and not worth looking at others because my goodness the recordings on his website are a dream come true of complete transformation. Whereas now it&#39;s dawning on me that all of those may be altered digitally somehow.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thousands of dollars down and can barely afford my own needs,this surgery was supposed to help me back into social life and the workplace as like so many others the PTSD of the masculine voice has kept me largely mute for easily 5 years beyond talking to strangers online for evidence and sending recordings.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve barely even gotten into his abusive attitude  and how many times he made me cry in person with a nonstop tirade of gaslighting and cyclical conversations until I said to him what he wanted to hear. But frankly his abusive ego driven personality isn&#39;t in comparison to his outright surgical fraud.
</p>
<p>
Further disturbing facts have been revealed by other patients that he discriminates based on your ability to pass and this will lead to him scamming you if you do not meet the cut.
</p>
<p>
You may think he&#39;s the solution to your problem but this man is a conman and a predator. I was you once and I &#34;knew&#34; he&#39;d solve all my problems with my voice. I&#39;m sorry but it&#39;s likely not going to be the case. He&#39;ll tell you to wait for years to see evidence of change when the actual healing time for vocal procedures is 6-8 weeks like everything else. He&#39;ll try to discredit you with fake accounts if you complain But understand well that complaints this severe do not exist with no problems. He is not able to give you what you want and should not practice at all. Go elsewhere, this warning may be your last chance to avoid this same situation, don&#39;t pass on it.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t let him scam you out of your money or your hope. Look for other options with real reviews you can find. I thought this surgeon only having word of mouth reviews was a good thing, it is not.
</p>
<p>
Stay away from James P Thomas. Scammer MD

I think this post is rather cavalier. You’re making serious accusations
<em>
without offering evidence.
</em>
There are probably a number of explanations for your surgical results, but I highly doubt that one of them is that he is “playing favourites” with his patients.
</p>
<p>
I am not a paid shill, but a very happy former patient (see my post history).
</p>
<p>
I recall going over informed consents with Dr. Thomas and him explaining outcomes that sound like what you’ve described. He also has audio recordings on his website which show a wide range of outcomes — not all are good outcomes.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.voicedoctor.net/media/audio" rel="nofollow">https://www.voicedoctor.net/media/audio</a>
</p>
<p>
I don’t want to diminish grief from a failed surgery, but you should reconsider the informed consent page that you saw before surgery.
</p>
<p>
I had a failed trachea shave that damaged my voice, and Dr. Thomas was able to fix it and at the same time make my voice pass 100% of the time. So I feel a debt of gratitude — and am highly motivated to offer a counterpoint to these very public accusations which have no evidence.

Right? I listened to the “bad” results on the website before I ever went to him. That’s part of why I chose him. I felt like I could trust a doctor who would be honest and realistic that not every surgery worked out 100% or gave the ideal voice. Now he’s being accused of being a “fraud” and “scammer” because of the very result he openly cautioned might sometimes occur…..pretty sad.

I spoke to him too,  however the crux of the issue of fraud is that my second opinion showed none of the surgeries he had performed  as I mentioned. It&#39;s easy to assume things are being overlooked and I understand these sorts of reactions would be needed. However I&#39;m entitled to my opinion on my own evidence and and within my rights to caution others. As the point of the issue isnt that the result cautioned against happened, it&#39;s that the surgery he alleged never happened to the level he described. Though I realize the text was quite long and it&#39;s easy to skim in outrage.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re more than welcome to disagree but I&#39;m not debating that facts as presented to me as this would be a moot exercise. We can agree to disagree

Additional Public service announcement, the first comment in the chain is actually one of James Thomas alt accounts, by all means research the accounts posts and unusual behaviour above and beyond the norm in his benefit. There are obvious other slip ups too. Secondly the other comment has been identified as Jonica Pile working in tandem with the above account. Thankfully she not only slips up that she&#39;s not a patient such as in her later comments, but she also follows the theme of &#34;autumn&#34; in her usernames.
</p>
<p>
Considering they spend more time trying to bury and smear the negative reports than answering patient emails or providing good results in the first place, I&#39;m confident this is a fairly comprehensive scam scheme with Jonica not only assisting him but also in my and some patients situation, doctoring finance documents to disguise the surgery as more serious than it is, in order to assist (defraud) financial institutions to get the funding they want to take from you. On my case I came clean, reported myself in this regard and forwarded the emails from Jonica willfully conspiring with me. As I know she&#39;ll see this anyway this serves as a little catharsis that she&#39;ll go down with me. Enjoy

It seems that those of us who have poor results are constantly gaslit and blamed for things out of our control. We are just part of the “bad” statistics. The surgery was a leap of faith with no way to know if you will be one of the “bad results”, and some of us just have to crash and burn while the rest become rockstars

Rather hilariously, since they deleted the media briefly and reuploaded. They since made the mistake of posting the years the recordings were made.
</p>
<p>
Let no one misunderstand the red flags of the last recording being 7 years ago in 2016. This certainly fits with the sudden influx of negative experiences recently, either he is too old to practise effectively, Deluded in himself or has willingly begun, as some patients have seen, started discriminating against patients who do not &#34;pass&#34;.
</p>
<p>
This fall&#39;s in line with the public visibility of transgender patients growing from that year. Seems like he&#39;s just tired of us now.
</p>
<p>
Remember the unusual behaviour to in comments such as this one above, and lower down. no reasonable person&#39;s makes it their business to counteract any negative reviews unless they are directly affected, such as with jonicas comments lower down &#34;autumnskye&#34; or something to that ilk.
</p>
<p>
Be very very careful with that clinic, any clinic that needs bots to challenge their honest reviews is not one that can stand on their own merit.
</p>
<p>
Once more avoid.

Thanks to Facial team i still wasn&#39;t passable and was swollen obviously cause i had my surgery with Thomas 47 days after FFS ( i should have never done that )😭 back in december 2021 😭. I really feel like he discriminates patients who don&#39;t pass yet tbh.

Is there somewhere I can read about these patients&#39; experiences? How does one come to the conclusion he&#39;s discriminating based on his perception of passability?

Here for one, one comes to the conclusion by comparing results discussing similar experiences between passing and no to the degree of success and generally look into it enough to satisfy correlation is linked. (When you post your experiences you tend to attract like minded individuals who suffer the same issues in DMS, unless of course it&#39;s a negative experience in which case the general consensus is to prove it didn&#39;t happen for some reason) I invite you to seek out other such posts on failures and successes to make your own judgement. I&#39;ve done my diligence to warn people, whatever risks people take with this surgeon are theirs alone, as I have stated. I&#39;ve no interest in debating reality on this post as it will change nothing that has happened to me or others. I do invite you to do your research yourself, but I&#39;ve no interest in doing leg work for you or have anything more to prove. Facts are facts, I&#39;ve done my diligence by warning people but what you do with that information is none of my concern. Wanna take a risk, do it, no one is stopping you from making the same mistake. Hopefully this nips responses like this in the bud, the only answers I have for you are read the above post, and do your own research, make up your own mind.

I&#39;m afraid so, my second opinion back in the UK showed he didn&#39;t do anything he said even near to what was promised. I empathize with you deeply on this matter, as I though he was the solution, but it does seem he has a pattern of disappointment, gaslighting and fraud. I know he has some successes but it seems those are unpredictable and rare. Further he can never tell you exactly what he did wrong when things &#34;don&#39;t pan out&#34;. The chance at a none result is reason enough to avoid however the lack of support and transparency following anything going wrong is also a large consideration to make. I myself am still looking for an alternative to actually do the procedure so am unable to suggest an alternative. I would exercise extreme caution if going ahead with James. Sorry I don&#39;t have better news for you, I hope whatever you choose works out in your favor

This was originally the idea as frankly we can&#39;t afford to go anywhere else. However getting the second opinion, and seeing what he didn&#39;t do, the gaslighting telling me what a success the surgery was, and the refusal to do a revision on the Femlar and telling me it&#39;s the CO2 laser or nothing; and that also being something barely done at all. It doesn&#39;t fill me with hope. Not to mention the complete radio silence since the summer after informing them of the second opinion and requesting the surgery to be done in the face of this evidence or a refund. Again doesn&#39;t fill me with hope. If they offered a revision on the surgery and did it to the level they said they would, I&#39;d have no option to take it. As like you my life is on the line with this. However it would require going into more debt on transportation flights hotel etc to go to see a surgeon who have already lied to me twice. Not a positive prospect. But as I say up to this point they&#39;ve refused anything revision talk, cut all contact and when we were communicating despite the site saying results would be seen in weeks they keep telling me it could take years to see any result. Which just isn&#39;t true. My advice would be to find the surgeon in Australia who does the same surgery as I&#39;ve heard nothing about them good or bad yet. Though haven&#39;t had the chance to coordinate anything new much due to depression from this. I realize in some situations you may have no choice but to visit him. Just be prepared for some bullying as even with the good reviews it seems him being a bit of a brute is a common thread. Just stay safe.

I had surgery with him. He tells you up front both oh the website and in person that there are no guarantees that you’ll get the results you want from surgery, that it IS surgery, and that it takes weeks (not “years”) to see final results. It’s also completely untrue that his results are “untested” or have no patient feedback (?) as he lectures another them all over the place. We’ve had a lot of happy patients  here. I myself had the CO2 laser and can give feedback on it, and there are published reports. We’ve also had patients who had less than stellar outcomes, and he has some posted on his site. Voice surgery is rough and when it goes well it helps a lot. When it doesn’t help it seems like it really goes awry.
</p>
<p>
As to your other claims I cannot see any situation that would happen. I’m sorry you had a bad experience and I hope your voice works out, but a lot of the other stuff you are saying simply isn’t grounded in fact. Making false claims isn’t helpful to anybody. One of the reasons I went to him was that he DIDN’T make me grand promises and was realistic about what he could offer: he played me “bad” results as well as good, and those less than ideal results are right there on his website for anybody to listen to. He’s very honest that sometimes, even when surgery is done well, there just isn’t a big change or the voice still needs work. Pretty sure all of us patients saw that ahead of time, so trying to claim after the fact that we were “botched” is wrong and incorrect. I was definitely aware I would need to keep up voice work for inflection if nothing else.

I wonder where &#34;here&#34; is. I understand what you want to get across and when I find a false accusation I&#39;ll certainly refrain from making one. However as I said before I can only operate on the facts as they are not how we&#39;d wish them to be. I still wish you the best but my review will stand as is with the reality of the situation how it is

Girl I’m so sorry to hear this, sending hugs. As someone who was also butchered by him I’m understand how difficult this can be.
</p>
<p>
When was your surgery and who were present during your pre op appointment? He had an intern and a resident, who were professional but I would not have wanted them to do the actual fem lar procedure other than holding retractors and maybe suturing. But I was out from anesthesia so I would not have known any wiser.
</p>
<p>
I am relying on training to sound somewhat androgynous. I went back a month ago for a follow up and he didn’t even want to do revision and blamed me for it.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think most surgeons will be held liable for trans related surgeries. I take responsibility for letting him botch me and training could have and is saving me from a totally masculine voice. Wish you the best recovery and successful transition.

Yes I certainly endured the &#34; it&#39;s all your fault &#34; too, if you know of any other surgeons who are capable of this I&#39;d be happy to hear about them. He certainly commits to intensive bullying to force you to see things his way, went as far as to engage in cyclical conversations until I broke down in tears and agreed with his point of view, to which he demanded to phone my mother to get an outside opinion and became quite contrite afterwards stating that my mother also attested I sound the same as before and like my brothers. I&#39;d say it&#39;s an ego problem and reliance on bullying which is a shame as he could have really been a saving grace if he did the surgery he promised.
</p>
<p>
I hope you find a resolution to what he did to you as well and I wish you all the best

Personally I think people who have deeper baseline voices like myself are just beyond his expertise to really benefit from the surgery. Before surgery I had sufficient volume and a decent range in both pitch and resonance, and I was able to sound somewhat feminine as long as I control it well. It’s been almost a year for me and I am just doing enough to sound as good as my trained voice before surgery. I’m not the first or the last person that got botched

My heart does go out to you, I don&#39;t know how much comfort it is from a random woman on the internet but I&#39;m really rooting for you. We&#39;ll pick ourselves up and keep moving forward as long as we don&#39;t stop &lt;3

From my experience Jonica spends a great deal of time not working as I&#39;ve sat in with her once or twice while waiting and she uses Reddit and social media and messaging back and forth with her family. I don&#39;t actually recall seeing her open emails in the whole hour I was sat with her.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a shame as his previous secretary Jody was very professional. I heard Dr Thomas is dealing with some legal issues in addition to current issues, however that&#39;s completely hearsay and I can&#39;t verify it, though considering the complaints coming out recently and criticism of the research paper published I&#39;m not overly surprised if it was true.
</p>
<p>
I gave up trying to email the clinic several months ago now, I would recommend sending complaints to the medical board to try to get your concerns addressed if he refuses to attend you.
</p>
<p>
I hope you find a resolution

thank you, I was looking for audios of CTA, got with his page, the results I heard were mediocre at best, and scared me , then  I  searched him, now i can rest knowing that i can expect better results of other professionals. his descriptions sounds a bit like he is likely experimenting with the patients.

Unfortunately vocal therapy doesn&#39;t work well for me on a psychological level. I have some hang ups about &#34;faking&#34; the voice. I realize it&#39;s not faking more getting the voice you should have always had. But the psychological draw back for me on top of the needed effort is very triggering for me. Instances where I&#39;m in pain or need to cough etc without having time to put the effort in that result in a male sound even with vocal training are incredibly humiliating and can be dangerous socially. Is why surgery was and is so essential. I do wish the two of you luck on that journey and hope it works in your favor. I&#39;ll have my fingers crossed for you
