Looks like standard dehiscence that’ll heal. Clit not being sensitive at 6 weeks sounds normal to me. My clit is still weird at 12 weeks.

If you’re a Purohit patient you should join us on the Sinai discord. You can get support there from other Sinai patients. :)

The symptoms you described, such as concerns about the winged tissue along the inner labia and the sensation around the clitoral area after surgery, could have various potential causes. Some possible explanations could include wound healing issues, surgical site complications, or normal variations in the healing process. However, only a healthcare professional who has access to your complete medical history and can examine you in person would be able to provide an accurate diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
I strongly recommend reaching out to your surgeon or healthcare provider for an in-person evaluation. They will have the necessary expertise to assess your condition, address your concerns, and provide appropriate guidance or treatment options based on their evaluation.

put this through Chat GPT and apparently its pretty accurate at diagnoses but dont take my word for it. Trust the doctor most
