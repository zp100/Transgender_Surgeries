Who was your surgeon? That vulva looks amazing!
</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t think I see any scars in this photo. If you are concerned, most skincare clinics should have some kind of treatment.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery until now? What made you choose Dr. Bank over suporn? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? And how do you conserve your results in terms of cosmetics, sensitivity and depth?

Hey! Recovery has been mostly fine for me. I had to carry a catether for about 10 extra days because of swelling, and that was by far the worst so far, but its psychological. Other than that my pain levels are basically non-existent so far, but I have a bit of a fucked up pain tolerance. So far dilation is a non-issue, but it should become painful in months 2-3, once the scar contraction begins. But this varies a lot from person to person, and many people have a lot more painful experience than me. In addition, i
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bank is slightly cheaper, and as good as if not as better as Suporn based on online rumour. And he has better English. I strongly recommend him so far.
</p>
<p>
As far as results - depth is a question of dilation, and both doctors make it very, very clear that all appearance can be fixed in a year, dilation is the most important thing in the first 12 months. I am very happy with my looks, even though everything is still swollen, and am also very happy with the sensitivity so far.

can i ask how much it cost? and how long you where there for? and how many visits did you do i.e. did you have to go to Thailand multiply times and if so for how long did you need to be there for the doc to see you? sorry for so many questions i know there will be answers on their website but it would be nice getting a first hand experience of the process. :D

They are there. Yes, Iâ€™m lucky, however, I do occasionally notice them. Hence why Iâ€™d be interested to see what other post op girls have done.

It would be great if you actually opened up to show us your scars, or took better angles.

We can barely see anything except wrinkled skin.

Idk you can post it in a comment tho
</p>
<p>
Have you looked into medical tattoos?
</p>
<p>
If your scar lines are lighter than the surrounding skin you can get them tattooed to match the surrounding skin and would be inconspicuous.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: What made you choose Dr. Chettawut over other surgeons? Do you recommend Dr. Chettawut? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics, sensitivity and depth? How was the stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Chettawut&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? And by the way many congratulations for the surgery.
