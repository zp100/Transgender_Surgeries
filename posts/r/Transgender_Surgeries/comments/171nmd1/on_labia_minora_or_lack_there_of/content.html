I have heard GrS Montreal is really good at no labia minora and rarely does ones with that. I haven‚Äôt ever been there but I have a feeling they just didn‚Äôt give you labia minora.

They are not good at it so much as they don‚Äôt know how to do anything else. It‚Äôs what happens when you want to do surgery in a couple of hours and get through a bunch of them every day.

I wonder why they don&#39;t make the minoras? Is it because of laziness or lack of skills? It is an important part in a vaginoplasty

It seems like they‚Äôve been doing it this way for 20+ years and can‚Äôt be bothered to learn any new techniques

Dr. Menard pioneered this is approach which was somewhat novel at the time 1990ish as it was one stage and could be performed quickly with few complications.  In those days aesthetics were challenged just about wherever you went.  So it was seen as an acceptable result.  Brassard took over the practice when Menard retired and has never tried to update or improve on their technique.

I didn‚Äôt have mine with those folks, but I, too, thought I had none. Now, almost two years post-op, they have finally emerged. They aren‚Äôt protrusive, but they‚Äôre there.
</p>
<p>
Ten weeks really isn‚Äôt that long. My surgeon told me I would be 85% healed at six months, 100% at one year.

It‚Äôs just how they always do it. I don‚Äôt think they have the skill or time to do otherwise. It will be difficult at this point finding someone to revise it and I think you‚Äôll have to look outside Canada.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, some cis women look like that and it‚Äôs quite a popular look. e.g. see the porn subs
<a href="/r/Innie">r/Innie</a>
and
<a href="/r/simps">r/simps</a>
.

As a mountain bike racer I can see the practicality and attractiveness of having neater/less there.  Doesn‚Äôt look bad imo

Grs Montreal make no labia minora to most girls operated here. I&#39;m not a big fan of that look tbh.
</p>
<p>
Theerapong in Thailand can help you with this but he would have to take the skin from another part of your body

Upvotes and IRL discussions say otherwise.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I am satisfied with Dr. Brassard and Montr√©al GRS but this is a well known and discussed aspect of vaginoplasty with his team.

I went with brassard, you and I look the same.
</p>
<p>
I like the way it looks though.
</p>
<p>
So many cis women worry about their inner labia not being nicely tucked in, I find it a bit of a blessing.

Unless you‚Äôre young the reality for most women is you don‚Äôt have it all tucked in  I specified I did not want it too cute as on 59 year old woman it isn‚Äôt realistic  Hence I have labia minora very visual as well as majora which is shrinking in size thankfully

Many cis women have labia minora that are small enough that you cannot see them without spreading the labia majora.

If you do have labia minora, they&#39;re obscured by the majora in those photos. You&#39;d have to spread the labia majora to ascertain whether minora are there or not. GRS Montreal does have a reputation, though.
