Yesterday I was showering and decided to grab some lube and play with myself. So far, masturbation was frustrating and there would often be more pain than pleasure. And a lot of frustration.

Not yesterday. I was able to come in minutes. It was a small orgasm but the post-orgasmic feeling of tranquility was real.

<p>
But that&#39;s not all.

After I micro-peaked, I peed myself. I have no idea.
