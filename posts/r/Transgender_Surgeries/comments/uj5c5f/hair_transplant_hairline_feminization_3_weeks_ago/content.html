Looks like your hairline is going to look really nice as that all heals up!  Hugs hope everything comes in nicely!

I had a transplant to fix my hairline shape even though I&#39;d had tons of regrowth from HRT. After they draw your hairline, they basically give you a bunch of Xanax and you pass out enough that you don&#39;t really remember anything until it&#39;s over (or at least that&#39;s my experience.) I had FUT (as opposed to FUE), I barely remember the incision, and honestly the scar has healed incredibly well-- I know where it is when I run my fingers through my hair because there&#39;s a loss of density there, but no one else can tell.
</p>
<p>
You can wash your head around day 5-10, depending on your surgeon&#39;s recommendation, and it feels glorious. I&#39;m still waiting a bit for my final results, but I had way less shedding than most people, I think because of HRT. I&#39;m not ready to share results publicly, but I&#39;d be happy to DM privately if you&#39;re interested.

I work graves, and basically had my operation right as I would normally sleep. So i just passed out as you say right after the series of numbing shots. Woken up for lunch and back down again. A nice 8 hours of sleep and i was finished. I was pretty worried about the mind numbing bordom of being there all day awake, but it went like a snap.
</p>
<p>
Honestly the itchiness the following week was by far the worst part.

Well... my advice is: do not hesitate to proceed =) This is a very... reliable and well established and safe procedure that is definitely changed the way I look =) I would say that the hairline is one of the most crucial visual face features =)

<p>
Is this two separate procedures or do they do it all at the same time?
</p>
<p>
I guess they pull your hairline down first, and then perform the transplant?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, in my case it was just one individual procedure: a hair transplant (I did it in Istanbul, Promed clinic:
<a href="https://landing-en.promedhair.com/">https://landing-en.promedhair.com/</a>
).
</p>
<p>
You will need at least 3 days there: 1st day - the day of consultation (and, maybe, a day of procedure), then one &#34;resting&#34; day&#34;, then the &#34;washing day&#34;, then you can go home =)
</p>
<p>
The procedure itself - is of two phases: grafts extraction and collection (taking individual grafts (follicles) from a donor area (random spots from the back of the head) - visually there is no difference in density. In my case, this phase lasted for about 2 hours.
</p>
<p>
And the second phase - is the insertion/stuffing phase - when the collected grafts are planted (individually) into the recipient area (in my case it was about 3 hours).
</p>
<p>
So, the whole procedure took less than 6 hours. (Started at 10:00, at 16:00 I was free, and finally could have a lunch =)
</p>
<p>
The package is kind of &#34;flat rate&#34; up to 10000 grafts, in my case they transplanted 3000 grafts. (My package was 900 EUR - I chose it because I wanted to spend more time in Istambul (one week), so I booked the hotel myself. But they have other packages: 1200 EUR and 1500 EUR for 2 and 3 nights respectively (+hair transplant and +transfers included, of course).
</p>
<p>
So, that is my experience. If you have any questions plz do not hesitate, I hope I will be able to answer =)

Didn’t check it, actually. “Didn’t ask — didn’t tell”.  I have all certificates to change my legal docs, but being and living abroad, it is not a quick process, so I still have M-passport.
</p>
<p>
And we were there with my wife, and I was just in casual “unisex” or “tomboy-ish” clothing, so, they thought that i am just a handsome young man :)

Clinic:
<a href="https://landing-en.promedhair.com/" rel="nofollow">https://landing-en.promedhair.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
I was surprised by the price too, I remember decades ago it was ~10..20k, so I opt in immediately.
</p>
<p>
Sidenotes: it was &#34;low season&#34; (April), it was immediately after COVID restrictions was lifted up, and the lira (₺) had they fall, so that all combined might be the reason of more affordable price.
</p>
<p>
But enough talking: you see the result, just book a consultation and get your quote =)

Those are two different procedures that should be done at different times. Pulling the hairline down (a scalp advance/hairline lowering) is super useful, and may even be covered by some insurances as part of FFS (especially common when getting a brow shave). You can have this procedure done more than one, and some people do recommend that.
</p>
<p>
Hair transplants, like OP&#39;s, can then be done after the hairline lowering procedure heals. (Or, i you don&#39;t want to do a scalp advance, could be done separately). It covers the scars left from a scalp advance, it advances the hairline, and it covers those annoying male pattern baldness on the sides of your head. The procedure is not covered by any insurance, as far as I&#39;m aware, which is unfortunate. The only downside is that after a single hair transplant, the density generally won&#39;t be quite as high as the surrounding hair. Some methods can even be done without any visible scarring under the hair, but they require shaving some portion of your head which is not particularly fun. Methods that don&#39;t require significant shaving involve an incision above the occipital bone and leave a faint scar that may be visible if you lost all your hair in that area, shaved your head, or went really short.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also a huge industry for cis men who want to change their male pattern baldness. The results are amazing, it&#39;s relatively quick, and it&#39;s not all that expensive. Many people fly from US/the UK to Turkey and other countries where there are many clinics and it&#39;s like a national industry. Check out
<a href="/r/HairTransplants">r/HairTransplants</a>
to see the results (almost exclusively) cis men are getting and see specific recommendations about where to go and cost. It&#39;s pretty awesome!

Got mine done two months ago. Had to get the full shavr which was fine because of needing my crown and hairline lowered to a feminine one and filling in the widow&#39;s peaks. As you said abovd, for density reasons I have to go through this all again in another 10 months. 😮‍💨
</p>
<p>
Its by far my biggest source of dsyphoria and the thing slowing my transition to a snails pace. I will have ffs, srs and a BA done before I have shoulder length hair. 🥲🤕
</p>
<p>
So yea its expensive. I will be out 22k out of pocket when all is done. The first four months after thr proceedure are the worse, after that you will start to see significant improvement. About 10% extra every following month.

I have never had my hair cut so short (they had to shave the back of the head (donor area) to use extraction tools).

Yes, local anaesthesia for both areas (donor and recipient) + sedation (optional, it switched me off for about 10 minutes in the beginning of the procedure, so when I woke up — the whole donor area was under local anaesthesia and after that it was easy just to lie down and dreaming  :)

Tnx! I had a FUE (individual follicle extraction and transplant).
</p>
<p>
I had FFS in December, my surgeon said, that it would be ok to have a transplant session 3 months after the FFS, the opinion of your surgeon may vary :)
</p>
<p>
P.S. You look amazing O_O btw.

Thanks for the info. Did you have any of your work done in LA? That’s kinda where I am. Did my Ffs Nov 30 with Dr Toby Mayer… so same timeline. You look amazing… Great result! Hair transplant is next up on my list… probably be working on myself forever 😂🤣

Where did you go and did insurance cover? I want to do this possibly, but am almost a year into informed consent with little money….

Hi, I did it in Istanbul, Turkey (I live in Ireland).
</p>
<p>
More details are in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/uj5c5f/comment/i7hi9vw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" rel="nofollow">this comment above</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Costs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a flight there and back again
</li>
<li>
hotel for 6 nights (3 or 2 nights are enough, I just wanted to spend more time in lovely Istanbul)
</li>
<li>
basic package
<a href="https://landing-en.promedhair.com/" rel="nofollow">https://landing-en.promedhair.com/</a>
900 EUR (up to 10000 grafts (follicles), they used 3000 grafts in my case , transfers included)
</li>
<li>
additional package for sedation and post-care (circa 350 EUR)
</li>
<li>
that&#39;s it =)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(there are 1200 and 1500 EUR packages are available - the hotel is included, transfers are included).
</p>
<p>
Not sure if it could be possibly covered by insurance, but I would definitely check it =)

were there any other clinics that you were considering? how did you decide on this one?  Sorry for the 2 yr reply, you seem to one of the few posts that explicitly mention the name of the clinic.

I love your hairstyle! I have mine short too, but now I have to grow out the sides a bit to cover the scars from FFS. The length you have after the seeding looks perfect and gives me ideas!

I dreamed about the ability to look feminine even with a short hair (and, I always loved the “tomboy-ish” shorter hair style), so thank you for this heartwarming validation :)

Yes! This is exactly what I have wanted for myself since coming to Washington State. I told my surgeon (Dr. Liu) that I always keep my hair short, so that is a consideration with surgeries. I do go in for rhinoplasty in a few months, but so far - magic!
