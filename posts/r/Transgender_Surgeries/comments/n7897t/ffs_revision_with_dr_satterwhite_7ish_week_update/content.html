Because there are a lot of posts about FFS but not many about revisions, especially when using a different surgeon than the one who did the initial surgery, I thought I&#39;d make a new post.
</p>
<p>
Small background info: Had FFS with Dr. Kleinberger KP NorCal in November of 2017. It sucked, and he denied a revision was necessary despite all evidence to the contrary. I had a revision of my FFS on March 22 2021 with Dr Satterwhite.
</p>
<p>
The good:
</p>
<p>
So, in terms of how feminine I look, it&#39;s a pretty stark difference this time. Mandible is noticeably less square. Forehead bossing is completely gone and my orbitals are rounded and soft rather than at sharp angles like they were left after the first FFS. My nose has a slight swoop to it and the hump that Dr. K left is gone as well. Still pretty swollen and bulbous at the tip, but I think it&#39;s going to look great in terms of shape in a month or two.  My eyes look less deep set as well. I&#39;m 34 years old. But I&#39;ve been told a lot recently that I look 25-27. Looking younger is always nice right? :-P I haven&#39;t even worn foundation since the surgery...
</p>
<p>
My face looks more &#34;diamond&#34; shaped as opposed to just kinda long like it looked before. The weird lump of swelling on my chin that never went away after the first FFS is also gone. I&#39;m kind of amazed.
</p>
<p>
The not so good:
</p>
<p>
The healing has been a lot slower than the first surgery, which I partially attribute to having more done this time than the first surgery. Dr. Satterwhite was more aggressive than Dr. Kleinberger. I still have a lot of numbness in my scalp and all along my mandible. Feeling is just starting to return to my lower lip this week and this is WITH 20+ treatments with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
</p>
<p>
I have a small scar under my left nostril from the lip lift as well, which is super noticeable to me, but apparently isn&#39;t to others...shrug. The area around my mouth looks a little &#34;jowel-y&#34; to me which I hope is just residual swelling. I&#39;ve started to do some facial yoga exercises to try to tone it up more.
</p>
<p>
The hairline scar and ones in my scalp are gnarly and red. It&#39;s upsetting for me to look at. It&#39;s further forward than on my first surgery so I&#39;m getting worried that hair won&#39;t cover it as much and it&#39;s going to be visible or need to be covered with concealer for the rest of my life... I&#39;ve been covering it with a headband for the time being.
</p>
<p>
Along the same lines, the scars in my scalp that Dr. Satterwhite said he could fix are pretty much exactly the same... he wasn&#39;t able to shrink them much, if at all. It&#39;s disappointing. There&#39;s some hair coming through the new scar which is in the middle of the old scar, but I doubt it&#39;s going to be enough to make a difference. Thanks to Dr. K, I&#39;m stuck with these 1cm wide, crescent shaped things on the sides of my head forever. My hair is thick enough to cover them at least when it&#39;s down. But I&#39;ll have to work around it for the rest of my life when I want to do an updo or something. At least it&#39;s not worse than where I was pre revision I guess.
</p>
<p>
Which brings me to my next negative. I didn&#39;t have any &#34;shock&#34; hair loss after the first surgery, but this time I did. Quite a bit actually. I lost hair in big clumps and it was upsetting to say the least. It&#39;s not happening anymore, but I have some thin spots all over my scalp which totally bum me out. I have thick, curly hair, so I&#39;ve been able to hide them fine. Both Dr. S and the PA both say that it will grow back. Apparently, they&#39;ve never had a case where it doesn&#39;t, but with my luck, I&#39;d be the first. lol... fml...
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you get an FFS revision, just be prepared that it sucks waaaay more the second time. The first two weeks were more painful and harder to deal with than my initial FFS. I cried a lot and I was in a lot of pain especially for the first week. The aftercare with Align has been pretty good I guess. I was a little bummed about having a phone appointment as my second follow-up. But I&#39;ve been having progress pics taken at all my O2 treatments which are sent to the surgeon&#39;s office.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I think it will be worth it. I&#39;m struggling with a lot of negative thoughts right now and I&#39;m worried about scarring. I&#39;m trying to remind myself that it&#39;s still early. I think the forehead incision took about 90 days to completely fade after the first surgery so it&#39;s likely to take at least that long this time. Patience is hard. I feel ugly and gross daily. But I also see myself in the mirror every morning without makeup and it&#39;s really a big difference.  If folks need revisions or are considering Dr. Satterwhite, I hope this helps.

You were pretty jazzed with Satterwhite in your post FFS revision AMA. Iâ€™m scheduled for my first (and hopefully only) FFS with him in July. This second post of yours is a little less favorable than the first. Making me a little nervous. Eeeek!

Honestly, I don&#39;t think any of it is his fault though. It would be great if he could have fixed my scars, but I guess I can&#39;t get everything I want.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s really just how i happen to be healing this time that&#39;s bumming me out. The only thing I&#39;m annoyed about right now is that the PA isn&#39;t returning my phone calls and I really need to get in for a follow up to talk about scaring and maybe getting in touch with a dermatologist. Remember, I had a shitty FFS with a shitty surgeon that accomplished nothing for me before I had this one. My situation is different than yours. You&#39;ll probably heal faster

I had FFS with Dr Grujala at Align and I am finishing up my Hyperbaric therapy. I am sure we have seen each other. Are you still going?
