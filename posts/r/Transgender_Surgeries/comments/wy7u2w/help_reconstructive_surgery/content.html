Hi, I&#39;m a trans woman in Pennsylvania.  I&#39;m 21 years old and got my vaginoplasty and breast augmentation done a few months ago by Kathy Rumer in Philadephia.  She screwed up big time, and I haven&#39;t been able to pee since March 22nd, I have been forced to use a suprapubic catheter.  It hurts and I don&#39;t like having to use it.  But I can&#39;t find any surgeon who can fix it so I can pee normally.
</p>
<p>
I have Medicaid so it would have to be somebody that accepts that.  Honest to God it hurts like hell and I don&#39;t want to be here anymore.  I can&#39;t run, I can&#39;t have sex or be active.  It hurts whenever I drink anything because my bladder is so screwed up and I feel broken.  I&#39;d really appreciate it if anybody could help me find a reconstructive surgeon that Medicaid would cover in PA.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just about done with this life.  I hate being in pain every single day.  And 6 months down the road I still haven&#39;t found a surgeon to fix this.
</p>

I know my words kinda pale in light of your situation, ive heard a lot of rely nasty stories about her. I have heard of a few US surgeons who are willing to help but i think its more if and whats damaged and how extensive. I really hope you can find some relief. Im pre op but knowimg how I am, if i was in that state id be crushed and my thought are with you. I truly hope you find a reasoable fix... stay strong

Not sure if this will be useful, but there&#39;s some info about Dr Kathy Rumer in the wiki here

If you decide to leave PA, the Crane Center (
<a href="https://cranects.com/" rel="nofollow">https://cranects.com/
</a>
) in Austin and San Francisco has doctors who might be able to help you.
<br>
If they can, they also may have programs to help you get to one of their centers.
<br>
Meanwhile, you can get in touch with them and see if they can make a recommendation for a doctor near you.
</p>
<p>
I hope you get the help you need very soon.

It may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic
</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.
</p>
<p>
And looking for local supportive med people may also  be an idea. Some people ask at lgbt places and support groups about local supportive med people, and
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/vzb1wi/25_years_postop_mount_sinaiwho_exactly_do_i_go/ig7c6pd/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
was also a discussion.
</p>
<p>
And in general
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/support/index#wiki_connecting_to_others" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransAdoption/comments/nnz697/join_the_trans_galaxy_an_18_inclusive_safe_space/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be a number of hints concerning looking for support and connecting to others.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/gender_therapists/index" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be a number of resources concerning looking for a gender therapist in case. Atm many use online counseling so it may not be necessary to only look for close ones.
</p>
<p>
And if you feel really low please reach out .. there are helplines, for example
</p>
<p>
translifeline.org Its trans people there. It may be necessary to call a few times until someone answers.
</p>
<p>
thetrevorproject.org/get-help-now/ They also have a chat and further resources like Trevorspace so they could be accessed from anywhere. It may be possible to use a proxy in case. And someone who worked there said they may also help people of all ages.
</p>
<p>
thrivelifeline.org/ They also have a chat
</p>
<p>
glbthotline.org/ They also have support groups.
</p>
