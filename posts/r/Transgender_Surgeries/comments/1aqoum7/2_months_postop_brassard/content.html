It looks like you have a lot of granulation.

I had to do silver nitrate every 3 days for about a month before all my hypergranulation healed up.

I&#39;m deeply sorry to hear about the challenges you&#39;re facing but on the bright side things don&#39;t look too bad. I encourage you to explore the possibility of consulting with doctor Theerapong in Thailand for aesthetic and depth revision.Â Good luck on your journey. ðŸŒº

Thank you! :) I&#39;ve seen his name pop up in revision threads a few times and it&#39;s something i am considering, but i had a very hard early recovery (discovered severe intolerances to several meds + a stubborn uti) and the possibility of going through this again but on the other side of the world in a country i don&#39;t speak the local language scares me to death. I guess i don&#39;t have the balls for it (lol). I think I&#39;ll have a good talk with Brassard once i&#39;m fully healed and decide from there

Hang in there. Youâ€™re only at two months, lots of swelling to go down still. Iâ€™m kinda off the opinion that we all have SI at some point during recovery. This surgery is gruelling. Just keep dilating. When you donâ€™t want to dilate, dilate. And be gentle on yourself, youâ€™ve come so far to be at this point. Two months is definitely a time you start to want to do other things but you have to accept the situation and take one day at a time. Take painkillers if you need them and get 2% liquid lidocaine mixed into your muco at the compounding pharmacy to apply at the start of your dilation. You shouldnâ€™t need a prescription for it, just talk to the pharmacist

In my case the lack of hood was not intentional, all the tissue just disappeared, when the gauze covering it came out the stitches were holding nothing. As much as i want to blame someone, it&#39;s just bad luck

My intention was not blaming anyone but just an observation for following his work for many years ! But gladly the trans medicine has evolved so much and if it bothers you will fix it very easily!

Do you have any feeling in your clitoris yet? If so how does it feel without the hood as you mentioned? Sending hugs things still have time to improve:)

I never lost feeling to the clitoris, but direct stimulation has always been painful for me and with the complications and all i haven&#39;t tried anything, i only stopped taking painkillers a few days ago

You lack a clitoral hood and labia minora, but It can get fixed with a revision. You better save up and go to Theerapong if you are unhappy with your result

I think the lack of hood can be addressed pretty easily.  Just keep working on healing for now.  It looks pretty typical Brassard and once it heals you will feel better all the way around.

Give it timeâ€¦besides the hypergranulation, it actually looks good compared to others Iâ€™ve seen. Iâ€™ve had hypergranulation as well and I was at my surgeonâ€™s clinic (Dr Maurice Garcia) every week to treat the hypergranulation tissues.  Be diligent with dilation.  Good luck!
