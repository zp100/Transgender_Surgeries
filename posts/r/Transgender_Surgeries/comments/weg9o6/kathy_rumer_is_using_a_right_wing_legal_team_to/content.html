The title says it all.

</p>
<p>
Her legal firm is Roger&#39;s Castor who represented Trump after his impeachment and this case is being brought before an anti LGBTQ Trump appointed judge. Google Chad Kenney.
</p>
<p>
She is using an anonymous blogger as a justification to target and intimidate her low income patients who cant afford a legal council and cant afford to go public with this. Get botched by the butcher, get sued if you speak out.
</p>
<p>
Kathy Rumer is no ally of the trans community in a time when republicans are actively rolling back abortion and LGBTQ rights.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE: a petition has been posted demanding Rumer&#39;s immediate resignation

It is so very sad she botches too many lives. And how many of her botched patients gaslight themselves, come on here to confirm their worries concerns, and then get gaslighted on here too.
</p>
<p>
That Rumer is a butcher. And no one should risk going to her. Good for those who caught her on a good day. So heartbreaking for the many who unluckily caught her on her standard bad botched days.

She likely does it intentionally. With her fail rate it has to be intentional. She probably does several successful ones to not draw attention as much to it as if she totally failed her license would be taken away.

It is intentional!! She is a cold heart soul. I remember looking her dead in the eye and she had no real emotions. I have zero clue who hurt this woman but I think that she views transwomen as men. Furthermore, I believe that she use this surgery to get back at &#34; men&#34;. There is a reason she accepts Medicaid and pays the most to the Philly Tran Con. She is going out of her way to hurt people. She is not particularly intelligent around lower surgery at all. I am fairly educated and when I asked her small questions that should have been easy she balked. Also, the problem with being a D.O. is that it is not the exact same as an M.D. I am aware they give them the same statues but they are NOT the same. M.D.s spend way more time studying then D.O.s. Not all surgerons are the same.

I want to expand on this point.
</p>
<p>
Rumer uses transphobic imagery on her website to promote her work. She used a stock photo of a &#34;gay man&#34; to advertise facial feminization surgery.

Geez. At first I’m thinking surely that’s impossible. Then I remembered oh, right, I would never do that, but there’s piles of evil people out there.

Could just be incompetence though…

I had a sit down consult with her at the Trans Philly Con. We were talking about phallo. She does not know what she is talking about. A few years ago she took pictures from Dr.Crane&#39;s website and passed them off as her own. When called out she tried to gloss over it.  For anything complicated I would run from her. She lies and manipulates.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Federal courts have been rejecting Trump’s unconstitutional policies, so now Trump is trying to change the courts. In nomination after nomination, his picks for federal courts are hostile to civil rights in general and specifically hostile to LGBTQ rights. As the Senate tries to rubberstamp and rush these nominees through, Lambda Legal has spearheaded a broad effort to expose their records and inform both senators and the public of the dangers they pose to our rights, to the rule of law, and to the nation itself.
</p>
<p>
As explained in our reports issued in 2019, 2018, and 2017, many of these nominees (1 in 3) have deep histories of anti-LGBTQ advocacy, which is why Lambda Legal is working so hard to defeat them. You can help by calling your senators and asking them to reject unqualified people for lifetime judgeships.
</p>
<p>
Listed here, by state, are all the nominees, the status of their nominations, Lambda Legal statements, blogs, and coalition letters detailing their positions and our reasons for opposing their confirmation.

on December 15, 2020
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A federal judge has suspended implementation of an antibias rule for Pennsylvania attorneys that was slated to go into effect Dec. 8. The new rule facilitates discipline for attorneys engaged in anti-LGBT bias or harassment.
</p>
<p>
But on Dec. 7, Judge
<strong>
<em>
Chad F. Kenney
</em>
</strong>
of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said the new rule constitutes “viewpoint discrimination.” Thus, it violates the First Amendment.
</p>
<p>
...Kenney, 65, has served on the federal judiciary for two years. He was appointed to the federal bench by
<strong>
<em>
President Donald Trump
</em>
</strong>
. He previously served as sheriff of Delaware County, Pa. He’s also a former member of the Pennsylvania State Republican Committee.
</p>
<p>
... Criticism of Kenney’s decision was swift. The Hon. A. Michael Snyder (retired), Chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association, issued the following statement: “The promotion of diversity and inclusion and the elimination of bias and discrimination in the justice system are core values of the [PBA]. We are committed to the vision of a justice system in which all individuals —  judges, lawyers, litigants, witnesses and employees — can participate free from discrimination and harassment.

<p>
... Castor was the district attorney for Montgomery County, Penn. During his time in office, Castor declined to bring criminal charges against Bill Cosby after Andrea Constand accused the actor and comedian of drugging and sexually assaulting her. Castor&#39;s decision was heavily criticized, particularly after additional women accused Cosby of a pattern of sexual misconduct lasting decades. Another prosecutor eventually brought charges against Cosby related to the assault on Constand, and in 2018, a jury found Cosby guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against her. Later, Castor got involved in the second impeachment trial through his cousin, Stephen Castor, a Republican attorney who previously helped defend Trump in his first impeachment. Bruce Castor then enlisted van der Veen as part of the legal effort.&#34;

Two years in and the defendant is still pro se, twice denied appointment of counsel. It’s bullshit that we don’t have civil

I’ve had a really good experience getting my top surgery with her earlier this year, but I started hearing about her fails with phallo shortly before my scheduled date (made me real nervous but I went with it). I felt treated with respect, everybody was gendering me correctly, taking the time to explain everything and answer my questions etc. and Dr. Rumer herself felt fairly easy to talk to imo, but I’m also white and not overweight (I hear she tends to have dog tag issues with larger bodies). I really don’t know what to think about it. If I had to get top surgery again, I’d probably try someone else, even if I’m really happy with mine :/ Thank you for sharing the information!

Wow. After doing some googling, the defendant was supposed to be a &#34;John Doe&#34; but Rumer&#39;s lawyers violated the gag order. There is some pretty sensitive information out there on the internet about this John Doe. Holy shit.
