I have been looking at options for GRS and feel like Dr. Bank is definitely my first choice due to his aesthetics. However, I’m not sure if I want/need a lot of depth. I have heard that minimal depth requires less dilation as well.

Does anyone know or has had experience with Dr. Banks and minimal depth?

Someone who I know of that is going this year is getting zero depth with Dr. Bank at the Suporn Clinic.
