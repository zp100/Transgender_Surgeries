This makes me feel so much better about my decision to go with Dr Ramineni. I have surgery with him April 11th of 2023. I’m sorry about the nurse misgendering you though, I’m glad everything else has been great for you, and I’m excited to read more of your experience and results as you heal.

I need to see my results and how the follow up care goes before I give a final verdict, but honestly this experience has been so positive and I definitely think he&#39;s one of the top surgeons in the U.S. Extremely professional, high quality healthcare, which has been a huge relief and massively impressive given my prior experiences with transgender medicine. I&#39;m not sure how much you&#39;ve read about/talked to him, but he&#39;s incredibly invested in the trans community and in caring for trans women in particular, and it definitely shows.

I have no doubts that your vagina is going to look great once the swelling goes down and you’re healed enough. I’ve heard he is extremely professional and his bed side manner is great, it definitely calms my anxiety down knowing all this. I know a little about him, enough for me to have chosen him for surgery, and seeing other patients results.

They schedule the first Tuesdays and last Thursday’s of every month. When I spoke to them they said I can choose any month I wanted. I scheduled back in October for this. I was able to book in January but felt I needed more time for hair removal first.

Ramineni does his best to not make people wait longer than 6 months from consultation to surgery date. I had my consult in March, they had a date for me in August, but I needed more time to prepare financially so I chose a later date.

I had srs with him in May 2022.  I feel he was a great surgeon and very professional.  I had a lot of swelling post op.  Ice helped. He saved my life and gave me the vagina I should have been born with.  There is a huge learning curve to life with and taking care of a vagina.  My nurses at GWU hospital were gendedr affirming and took good care of me.   My pacu nurse was not great he had been pulled from another area and was not trained in pacu and had never done it before.  I was in a lot of pain because of that the first 5 hrs( grossly under medicated ie only tylenol , tramadol, and finally oral oxy) .  When he went on break after 3 to 4 hrs an experienced nurse immediately gave me iv dilaudid and my pain became tolerable.  I too had to wait for a bed.  After the pacu hiccup, my care was superb.  Katie and Dr. Ramineni rounded at least daily.  I am very happy with the results.  Charlie

I can&#39;t imagine what being that undermedicated must have been like, it sounds brutal. I had to have fentanyl and Dilaudid while I waited ~20 mins after waking up for the pain team to start my epidural lidocaine, and it still hurt a lot even on the fent. I&#39;m really glad everything came out good in the end!

It was like being burned alive.  Just like fire. Not Dr. R&#39;s fault more like a pacu manager putting an untrained nurse on by himself.
