So sorry you&#39;ve had a bad experience x
</p>
<p>
Are you saying the entire op was done in 75 minutes? Or just the suturing? (I only ask as I&#39;m not sure how long any of this is supposed to take, though if that&#39;s just for the op it seems awfully quick).

I was in the OR for 75 minutes total. He lied to my face a few months later and said it was two hours. My records state clearly 75 minutes.

Just saw your other post but thanks for replying here. Jeez that&#39;s fast. Is there any reason he&#39;s rushed something like this?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve spoken to him regarding srs (and had a bit of a funny vibe from him) and had heard he tried to be as fast as possible but even 2 hours is ridiculous, nevermind 75 minutes!
</p>
<p>
Have you spoken to him or anyone on his team regarding this? Surely there&#39;s some kind of recourse you can seek over this?

Surgery duration seems to variate a lot between surgeons. Brassard currently does it in an average of 1h30 without vaginal cavity and 2h with, (edit : but it is still more than what you are describing - which seems really not a lot -) Bellringer did in your case. Other surgeons in the EU I know of take longer and thai surgeons such as Chettawut (5-6hrs) and Bank (4-5 hrs) significantly more.

75 minutes is not 1.5 hours and as far as I know nobody else has ever had it done this fast. Shows in the result as well. Really not happy with it.

thats because its ppt which is MUCH more complex than penile inversion, most pI surgeons take 2 hours. ppT surgeons take anywhere from 5-10 hours

Yeah. Just be careful with the generalizations. There’s a lot of information to search through here. Don’t want little ones thinking it’s an easy breezy surgery when statistically they data says PI averages 4.15 hours.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon gave me a study to read but cannot find the paper online.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, I’d be quite concerned if my surgery was only 2 hours. 2 hours is a breast augmentation. Not a complete restructuring of one’s genitalia.

I&#39;ve never rseen anyone else on this sub that has had a 4 hour PI surgery but I guess you dont talk about it since that on paper is more than enougn time. Most are 2-3 hours but definitely there are complaints of 2 hour surgeries even though  I think thats the new norrmal as surgeons get more experienced. As for my experience, 2 hours is enough as my results are cis-like.

Bellringer operated on me in about 2 to 2.5hrs and I have a good result. I went down just after 5pm and woke up at 8pm.

I was just saying that surgery duration seems to variate a lot from one surgeon to another and that some seem to take more time than others (without any comment on results here). Of course, it is certainly related to the technique used. In any case, 75 min is certainly the shortest time I&#39;ve heard of and maybe its not common for this surgeon ? (The information on the website of Parkside and on his own doesn&#39;t include the average duration of the surgery from what I&#39;ve seen).

I was offered a &#39;genital examination &#39; by him a few months ago but no way I&#39;m letting him near me again after what he has done.
</p>
<p>
Reason he rushed it... Saturday morning, perhaps he was late for golf of something. Really gave me the impression that I was just in the way of him doing something else.
</p>
<p>
If you do decide to go with him (good luck) insist that someone else / a nurse is in the room as well. He treated me like absolute shit and really would have liked a witness. Oh and ask him about pain relief post op, to him it&#39;s a joke... He actually joked about it ! Fucking twat.
</p>
<p>
I have sent a formal complaint but not received an acknowledgement in writing just one phone call. They have now offered me an appointment with a different surgeon to hopefully get it fixed. Wish it was in a different hospital if I&#39;m really honest and not sure I&#39;m mentally capable to be able to go there again.

The hospital has arranged an appointment for me to see a different surgeon. Hopefully they will be able to fix most of it
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s too late for my mental health and I doubt they can improve sensation but if it ends up looking even remotely cis / no or significantly reduced scarring and reduce the bulges that are meant to be labia Majora but just look like testicle skin then maybe I can be happy with it.
</p>
<p>
The only way I can see the dilation / internal issues to be resolved is to cut out the mess that&#39;s in there and re-line it with intestine or perotenial tissue. Anything that doesn&#39;t feel like skin and is even slightly slippery would be an improvement.
</p>
<p>
I have made it very clear in my complaint that I am not dealing with him again and am very unhappy with the way I was treated and him lying to me on multiple occasions.

That&#39;s awful. He shouldn&#39;t be operating on people at all if he&#39;s happy to rush something like this so it doesn&#39;t spoil his weekend or whatever the hell he was doing.
</p>
<p>
For most of us this is going to be a momentous, life changing occasion. How could anyone have no problem just rushing through something like this? Disgusting behaviour by him.

<p>
I presume you&#39;ll be seen by Tina Rashid?

You presume correctly. Such a difference between two people. I really wish I had known I could have chosen her instead but I was given the distinct impression it was him or nothing. In hindsight nothing would have been the smarter option.

Well I really do hope she can improve things for you and I hope you don&#39;t blame yourself.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know much about Dr Rashid but I&#39;ve heard she has a nice bedside manner and is more caring and considerate (probably by a longshot) than Bellringer.

I have been blaming myself since I woke up, then again when I seen how bad it looked, again when I realised it wasn&#39;t getting better. I should have known better and researched more but I didn&#39;t know about Reddit until it was done :(
</p>
<p>
Thank you, she was really nice in hospital and tried to help me as much as she could but was restricted in what she could do as she was not my surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I really hope she agrees to try and fix it, I don&#39;t think I could cope if she said no.

My surgery took just about 7 hours, I had mine done in Thailand, I&#39;ve seen many results from Canada and the USA and chose to not do it on this continent, bellanger and the Montreal team in my opinion are hacks and it shows the result posted is typical of what I have seen. No inner outer labia definition, no clitoral hood etc. I&#39;m sorry and feel horrible for any woman who had to use these Drs. They shouldn&#39;t be able to practice medicine, unfortunately numerous revisions will need to be done to get a satisfactory result in the future, I&#39;m very sorry for the OP, I don&#39;t suger coat anything when I speak on it and I apologize if it comes off harsh and to the point. The scaring is horrible, and this technique they are using is extremely outdated and not acceptable. I know many woman who have complications that u r having. Everyone should sue that Dr. And have his license REVOKED. I UNDERSTAND it&#39;s cc a free surgery, but that doesn&#39;t give them the right to butcher woman like that. It should still be quality work. Good luck in the future sorry to come off harsh it pisses me off to see Drs do this to us woman.

You are very welcome and I&#39;m sorry u had to expieeance being butchered like that, unfortunately ur results are typical of Montreal, I&#39;m not sure why they are allowed to continue doing this and being happy with their work. This comes to research when ur letting someone touch u. Research is important because this is not only permanent but u have to have this for life. I don&#39;t know why u chose Montreal but it still should have been quality and it wasn&#39;t. I really truly hope for ur mental well being ur able to get this repaired in the future to attain the results u truly want. U can message me anytime I&#39;m always here to talk. I&#39;m 22 days post op my results are posted here if u want to look. Don&#39;t be afraid to ever ask for my opinion I&#39;ll give it. Sine here will get pissed at me for telling u the truth and not pad ur ego with compliments but u deserve the truth and honesty when u ask for it

Just to correct you slightly. My surgeon was James Bellringer in the UK. Sorry if you were thinking of someone else. Easy mistake to make x

I was thinking the other one in Canada, my apologies either way the technique is outdated and that one shouldn&#39;t be practicing medicine either. However I still wish u luck.

Just checked your pics and your sutures are excellent and look like the surgeon took care to reduce the chance of scarring to a minimum.

Congratulations x

Thank u. I&#39;m healing very well. I just put my 1st pair of jeans on in almost a month I&#39;m excited lol. The little things. Also idk if anyone has recommended these but try period panties if ur discharge isn&#39;t terrible, u have to to change them out a few times a day but eliminated the chaffing I was having to allow it to heal. I just started using mederma on the labia to soften it I hope it works.

Hi, I&#39;m assuming that my insurance wouldn&#39;t cover the surgery in Thailand. How&#39;s much did you have to pay? If you&#39;re not comfortable answering I understand.

So similar looking in my experience, but i had dehiscences the day 8 or 9. Almost half the sutures (lower part, the comisure) blew up, and had extreme swelling for 3 months.
</p>
<p>
Now they closed by 2nd intention. Not so big scars but they feel hard at the touch. I can&#39;t put anything without lube.
</p>
<p>
Oh my time in OR was 3 or 4 hs.  I&#39;m with PTSD from all the SRS related things....dr Belinky was a full psychopath gaslighting and blaming me in every time.

Mine took over 6 hours and is a great outcome.  Colo-vaginoplasty.  I had FFS done at the same time.  I was out for 14 hours in total.  I recently discovered that I even have a g-spot capable of achieving orgasm, not a p-spot.  I have that on the other side and is completely different experience.  I can’t imagine 75 minutes is enough time.  That’s terrifying.  I hope you have some satisfaction with the outcome.  My surgical team is at IM GENDER clinic in Barcelona.  I don’t know if the g-spot is a happy accident or a trial procedure.  I just asked him about it as I only discovered it last week.  They are well known for doing revisions if you need one.

I don&#39;t think this is typical. The majority of women that go with bellringer are happy minus his terrible bed side manner. My surgery took just over 2 hours. I heard he was quick but as its just PI and he very experienced I accepted it and rashid times are similar. I do wish I gone with rashid but only due bedside manner. Bellringer pain control protocol pretty poor, same if go with rashid. Morphine day 1 then paracetamol and ibuprofen. If you totally in agony they may consider other options I was told but they avoid anything that can make you constipated which limits things. In terms of my own results I&#39;m pretty happy. I have bit of scarring more obvious where had small tear and granulated tissue but rest of scars are blending in. If wounds seperate the scarring is worse but usually down to swelling. I guess I would of liked my clit more defined as its really buried deep and flat but works fine and no issues orgasm. Depth 6.5 inches still at 6 month mark. Tiny bit granulation and discharge still, no pain. Everything else is normal. Sure I would of loved thai results but my private insurance covered UK only but given it being uk results I can&#39;t really complain. Was all straightforward.

I would have appreciated the extra 45 minutes he spent on you. Maybe he could have done a better job, and not left me in agony and requiring more surgery to fix his botch job.

I&#39;m sorry for the issues you had and may be him to blame. However if you get splits you will get severe scarring. Minus the scarring, the actual vulva itself looks really good.

To also add. The suturing in your 2nd pic dosent look much different to mine. It looks like the swelling pulled a lot. Mine has healed better tho.

Idk if you wanna hear this but I think despite some of the issues noted in this thread, it’s actually kinda cute. I hope that you’re able to find a fix for the scarring stitches. 75 minutes seems pretty crazy as far as a surgery this intense. I’m not past my year mark on HRT but I do plan on getting SRS and seeing how many complications there are terrifies me.
