My surgery was a bit over a month ago Aug 22nd. So I was hoping maybe I could play a bit as I have been raging horny since I woke up from surgery but like I still can&#39;t feel much.
</p>
<p>
It definitely registers pain but not much else and I can&#39;t help but feel this profound disappointment. I know it&#39;s still early but I was hoping maybe someone had some tips to like help her wake up?
</p>
<p>
My BF said my doc did a great job esthetically though.

Give it time. It was about two and a half months before I could play properly and get an orgasm. You don&#39;t want to damage anything 😉 Congratulations on getting the surgery, though! Xx

First off thank you 🥰 Being my own caretaker through all of this hasn&#39;t been the easiest of things but so far it&#39;s been worth it 🥰
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not like not even looking for a &#34;proper orgasm&#34; I just want to register something other than ouch. My bf did try to help at one point and it wasn&#39;t till they went a Lil harder that it went from nothing to feeling &#34;far away&#34; I&#39;m just nervous about doing that myself 😅
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;ma try to stay patient and maybe poke her from time to time. 🥰
</p>
<p>
Thank you.

I&#39;m in almost the exact same boat on Aug 16th for me.  I asked my Dr this question at my last follow-up a week ago, and based on my healing, I was cleared to use vibration to help wake things up. With the instructions of just be gentle. Also, as others have said, give her time more than anyone on here. I fully get where you are as we are days apart. It&#39;s easier said than done. My G spot is also still waking up as well.

Yeah just been hard just about all of my friends through the same doctor (Ramineni) have achieved an orgasm by around this time (if not an extra week) and I&#39;m here poking at it with a stick (not litteral) asking it to wake up. Though she has noooo problem sending me pain signals... she&#39;s a champ at that 🤣
</p>
<p>
I was just really hopeful cause I was feeling my initial pings on day 2 you know?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been frustrated enough that the other day I went to go jackoff before remembering &#34;right no dick for stress relief&#34; D:::::::

Well w things come to mind.  1 and I can&#39;t stress this enough love your not your friends. I was up moving just fine the day they took packing out. I heal really well. I&#39;ve gotten close but not over the hump.  2 nerves can take up to a full year to re connect 3 and lastly we went from the old Joy stick atari to playing on PC so many more input commands. It&#39;s going to take a second to get everything figured out.

Haha all very true.  I had some wound separation along my labia that&#39;s taking a while to heal so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that is also holding me back as they still hurt a bit.
</p>
<p>
Trying my best to stay patient 🥰🥰🥰

You don&#39;t have to wait three months. Put a blanket or towel over the area...and use a small vibrator on top of that so the force of the vibration won&#39;t be too much. It&#39;ll feel like gentle vibration. Your clit will thank you. Yes I have srs. And I orgasmed a month after my procedure

Hmmm a cloth over my clit? That&#39;s a good idea.  I got a Lil bullet and it on vibe straight on it was like instant &#34;back the fuck off&#34; 😅
</p>
<p>
The pain stuff is what gives me hope. Though definitely don&#39;t want to play through that.
</p>
<p>
I appreciate the tip 🤗🤗🤗

The nerve pain was pretty fierce for me. Doc suggested Neurontin, but that was a hard balk for me. I tried Δ-8 gummies instead and it worked extremely well. I highly recommend it.
</p>
<p>
The nerve bundle will re-wire and re-purpose at its own rate. There’s no way of which I’m aware to speed the process. Trying to might even be counterproductive. 🤷‍♀️
</p>
<p>
At the one month mark, my surgeon told me to begin exploring her
<em>
with the pads of  my fingers
</em>
. I started lightly using a vibrator at three months. Dorothy finally made it to the Emerald Clitty at four months.

I was recommended to try taking a b vitamin complex from a friend apparently there is literature suggesting it could help.
</p>
<p>
But for sure I&#39;m gonna take it easy on her, she&#39;s been through a lot 🥰

Dr McGinn has us take a couple supplements that help with nerve growth and healing. I think Zinc and vitamin b maybe? I forget but I definitely can orgasm.

Right I keep forgetting zinc. Well I do have a few supplements I take that has a sufficient amount (for daily requirements at least)
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m either set or I need to look into that further. Thank you

I&#39;ve been told I could play around just becareful of it.
</p>
<p>
I still have healing suture wounds on my labia that hurt a bit, so I could also be getting thrown off by that. So, more healing, perhaps for sure.
