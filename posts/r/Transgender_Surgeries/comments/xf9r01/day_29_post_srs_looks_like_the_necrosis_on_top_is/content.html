Funny thing that happen while doing the dilatation. When the 20 min marks hitted I stopped pushing the dilatator inside of me. Five seconds after I sneezed hard, so the dilatator went out like a bullet and I was laughing so hard just because of that hahaha.

Be really careful, this can do damage.
</p>
<p>
If you are going to sneeze, try to hold the sneeze a few seconds and remove the dilator first.
</p>
<p>
My understanding this is less important as time goes on but you are only 3-4 weeks post so it‚Äôs still delicate.

I took a big step... I could have just stayed with my penis, I mean I didn&#39;t had bottom dysphoria... But I preferred a vagina way more than a penis. So I just toke that step and went through it. It&#39;s scary, but for sure at the end it will be the best. So don&#39;t be scared of taking that step for a happier life.

I‚Äôm pre-everything and only out to 5 people irl, so I‚Äôm a long way from that yet, and like you I don‚Äôt have bottom dysphoria‚Ä¶but the smoothness of a vagina and the idea of closing/crossing my legs without squishing anything seems amazing. I‚Äôm just really scared of going through with anything; partly because of the current political situation pretty much worldwide and partly because I hate the thought of going through all the trouble of coming out (which could lose me my family) and getting hrt/surgery, then once permanent changes have happened looking at them and thinking ‚ÄòFUCK THIS ISN‚ÄôT ME.‚Äô
</p>
<p>
Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking as I‚Äôm prone to doing, but I saw a post from someone on here recently who had completed their transition but was asking about an srs reversal because they wanted their male body back‚Ä¶I hate the thought of that being me, especially since I don‚Äôt have much dysphoria.

Well I&#39;m not gonna lie to you. Yeah there&#39;s people who want to change back. But just a few, at the end you still have the time to think carefully and make the choice you think is better for you. The fear is always there and more when the dysphoria it&#39;s not big.
</p>
<p>
So now that you are pre everything you should take some time to think about what you really want. Ask yourself every question you can about being trans. I wish you luck with the choice you make and hope you find your true self ‚ù§Ô∏è

I struggle to trust myself though so I think I‚Äôm gonna need to talk to a therapist about this üòÖ I‚Äôm still kinda grappling with the idea that I am actually trans, because I do have an idea of just how much harder my life could become as a trans woman (and my life has never been easy as it is).
</p>
<p>
However I really shouldn‚Äôt be dumping this here when you‚Äôre healing - I‚Äôm sorry üòÖ. I hope the rest of your recovery is swift and straightforward!

You don&#39;t have to worry about that. We are here to help and listen to others of our community. And yeah going to a therapist it&#39;s a good idea.
</p>
<p>
Everything I say now is in the hypothetical case that you are really trans.
</p>
<p>
And well yeah living as tras can be hard at the start but at the end it&#39;s what you are. Like I said one time you have two choices:
</p>
<p>
(You could be trans or not but I just say this)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Taking the &#34;easy&#34; road of being cis and thinking I can do it and life that life, but at the end that road is gonna get more and more difficult to go through.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Take the &#34;hard&#34; road of being trans, but that road little by little is going to get easier. Yeah there will be a lot of hard moments but the end is being your true self.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I explain myself like sh**

You explain well, I understand your point üòä.
</p>
<p>
I should clarify that I didn‚Äôt mean I was grappling with whether or not I‚Äôm trans; after remembering all the times I‚Äôve thought about what it would be like to be a girl throughout my life and how
<em>
incredible
</em>
it felt to finally just let myself believe ‚ÄòI am a girl‚Äô a couple of weeks ago (that was my first taste of euphoria) I‚Äôm pretty sure I am trans, at least on some level.
</p>
<p>
I just meant I‚Äôm grappling with the realisation that I am trans. Like, this is really me. I‚Äôm really a girl.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm gonna keep experimenting with clothes and  make-up for a while, but I definitely suspect that voice training and hrt will be on the horizon, even if I‚Äôm terrified for my job prospects (I‚Äôm an aspiring actor).

You know I think I am following the same thought patterns the longer I am on HRT. At first I thought ball removal would be enough then get off blockers and then I thought no, I will have zero depth vaginoplasty(am asexual) and now am thinking if I am going to have THE surgery might as well go all in and have the vaginal canal. Would prefer PPV to penile inversion though but since the NHS only does penile inversion it looks like I am stuck with it unless I happen to come across the best part of ¬£30,000 or so(I have no clue how much it would cost). I suppose I could have zero depth to begin with and then have PPV done later as and when it becomes available on the NHS?

I m in UK been waiting over 4.5 years for SRS I d advise you away from zero depth as that could completely ruin plans on the future should you change your mind There are many who ve regretted that as for PPV forget it in UK  It‚Äôs not available and a certain person will be around quite a while to make sure of that for a long time to come  You can get it at Kamol for about ¬£16 k all in but a few worrying reports have been seen recently I was attracted to PPV but you need to research further into it. Often people do it as a revision or when funds are available. If you‚Äôre older ( post 55 ) your options may be more limited  I ve been on NHS prescribed HRT over 4 years and atrophy kicks in the longer the wait for surgery  With Dr Thomas death it means only one hospital is doing NHS SRS and a lot of their time is taken creaming off private patients ( same 2 surgeons btw )  I m on health committee and know waiting lists now unknown as they have no solution to the necessary observations and sign offs that the newly trained surgeons need  Hence I reckon about 3 years plus after final surgical sign off probably more  and Tories hate us and will be less funding in future

If you let me know you age and which GIC you are attached to them I can give you an informed estimate ? Yea I have access to almost perfect timescales across all gender clinics  Merely offering help ok  If you‚Äôre Kate 40 s or early 50 s you still have entry of time - it‚Äôs up to you how you use it But I d advise to listen to those who really DO know ok ?

Thailand might be cheaper than you think. There‚Äôs one surgeon who‚Äôs only $2300 or so, though not someone I‚Äôd reccomend.
