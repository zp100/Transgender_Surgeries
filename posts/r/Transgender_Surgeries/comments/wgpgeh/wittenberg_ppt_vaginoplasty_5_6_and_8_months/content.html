I wanted to post some slightly longer-term results from Wittenberg for this community. I agonized over what surgeon I&#39;d go with for most of my life, and spent countless hours on this thread. I eventually chose Dr W.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, I have no idea what will happen tomorrow, but as of today, I am:â€¢Â Fully orgasmic (and frankly, having the best orgasms of my life!)â€¢Â Very happy with the aesthetics,â€¢Â Sitting on a depth of about 14-14.5cm, or around 5.5&#34;,â€¢ Completely free of dysphoria,â€¢Â More comfortable with my own body than I&#39;ve ever been, andâ€¢Â Back to being a competitive athlete.
</p>
<p>
I did experience a little bit of separation on the left labia minora in the first few weeks after surgery. In retrospect, it might have been due to a slight slip while walking in the rain shortly after the packing was removed. Regardless, it&#39;s a small aesthetic issue that doesn&#39;t affect my love of my anatomy, and I doubt I&#39;ll opt for a revision.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also been dealing with granulation tissue, though no more than I was led to expect. Other than nuisance bleeding, it&#39;s benign. My gynecologist commented very favorably on the depth and appearance at four and six months.
</p>
<p>
Pain throughout was negligible, although MoZaic cautioned me not to say that without qualification. ^_^ It varies greatly, and they want to make sure people come in with a realistic assessment of the probabilities. They also have a policy of not posting the best results on their website, opting to show results that are more average, or show common complications.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, after years of seeing the things surgeons said on their websitesâ€”and always feeling a little like I was being &#39;sold&#39;â€”the openness and frankness from MoZaic about the risks, recovery, and so on, helped my level of trust tremendously.  They disclosed their complication rates right up front in the initial consultation, including some of the lessons learned, and the lack of long-term data about PPT outcomes and satisfaction for this specific surgery.
</p>
<p>
Do with all this what you may. ^_^

Do you live near Wittenberg or did you have to travel. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to pursue her as my surgeon but I live in Texas so Iâ€™m nervous about that.

I live in the bay area, which made the decision easier.  It&#39;s definitely an expense staying in the bay area, so there is that. That said, if for some reason I had to do it all over again, I&#39;d travel to her.

Out of all the results Iâ€™ve seen Iâ€™ve definitely loved wittenbergs the best. Yours is no exception. Iâ€™ll definitely be traveling and staying there once I have enough leave saved up.

Check out Trans Heartline. Itâ€™s a recovery house for Trans folks. About $150-160 a day, for two with meals. There are three rooms for three folks recovering with a caretaker. Itâ€™s in Marin, but if you can use Lyft or public transport itâ€™s not bad. I just used them while recovering from FFS.

During consult I asked Dr. Wittenberg if they were an option and she told me no; it&#39;s apparently &#34;too far out&#34; away from the office.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been quite frustrated by a few surgeons being obstinate about recovery options for those of us without family or friends who can take that kind of time off.

Adding for clarity: The picture captions have the accurate dates. The first post lost the images, and I had to add them back in. In the process, I added different images, so the subject disagrees with the content.

You look amazing, and I&#39;m so glad to hear how successful this surgery has been for you and how you&#39;re feeling more at home in your body than ever before. Congratulations, and thank you so much for sharing this.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been curbing any interest I have in going for PPT because I&#39;m physically active, and thought it best not to pick a method that&#39;s more internally invasive. Now I&#39;m more hopeful because you&#39;re a competitive athlete haha. If you have any thoughts that can ease my worries, I&#39;d really love to hear them.

I felt great at about six weeks. I was skating again at about eight-nine weeks, though no heavy lifting or strenuous activity is allowed until twelve weeks, so I was taking it easy.
<br>
I skated in a roller derby bout right at about 13 weeks after surgery. Back to weight training and such not long after the 3.5 month mark.
</p>
<p>
I honestly felt great, and still do. I really should be clear that everyone&#39;s mileage will vary, and I don&#39;t want to issue any unqualified recommendations or sound like it&#39;s anything magical. It&#39;s absolutely a major surgery, and it&#39;s nothing to take lightly. That said, I feel as good as ever, but I feel, as I put it, &#34;normal...&#34; for the first time in my life.
</p>
<p>
My best advice is to talk to surgeons and ask questions. Do a lot of research (which I&#39;m sure you are) and know what you&#39;re in for.

Thank you for answering and the advice, and it&#39;s always good to get a reminder that every body is different and how YMMV. And I&#39;m wanting to be well-prepared and and well-informed about possible risks and complications with all these surgeries, absolutely.
</p>
<p>
Again thanks for the post, and best wishes with continuing to heal!

Thank you! ^_^ I reached a point around the four month mark where it no longer felt at all like a surgical site, and basically just felt &#34;normal,&#34; and that&#39;s how I feel now. I don&#39;t even think about healing as a thing anymore... heck, I&#39;ve been dealing with some minor knee injuries from roller derby that have been more impactful on my play this year than surgery, which is NOT what I expected to say.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m excited for you and your journey! ^_^

Thank you very much, and apologies for my words back there about &#34;healing.&#34; Glad to hear it was a smooth and quick ride to seeing it as a normal part of you.
</p>
<p>
Despite how impatiently I&#39;d been waiting to start HRT as well, it still took me a bit to stop medicalising myself in a sense and accept my new normal. It&#39;s a concern for when I&#39;d be recovering from my own surgery in the future, but experiences like yours are very heartening!

Your result is amazing and I had my consult with her office earlier today actually! It was with Dr Bonnington and Iâ€™m seeing dr wittenberg in a few weeks. Honestly Iâ€™m not very reassured because their serious complication rates seem a tad higher than the other surgeons. I do appreciate the honesty though. Could I ask who else you had consults with and what made you choose Wittenberg over the others?

<p>
Frankly, I think they&#39;re just more honest about their complication rates. I spent most of my life trying to find a surgeon, and their honesty is what sold me. Complications with a major surgery, especially one of this nature, are very common. Many other surgeons talk up their results, but leave many people across the community with serious issues with them.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Serious complication,&#34; in this case, is an ambiguous term, but I tend to assume by that you mean potentially life-threatening, or catastrophically failed results like prolapse, graft failure, or fistula... in which case MoZaic&#39;s rates are actually really good (and the trend for their more serious failures is remarkably positive.)
</p>
<p>
However, they also perform more complex and variant surgeries, such as penile-preserving vaginoplasty, peritoneal pull-through, etc., and so that does drive some instances of minor complications. I also think the technique around constructing the labia minora results in it being too fragile during the healing process, resulting in a high rate of retraction. (But the definition of their labia minora in a one-stage vaginoplasty is better than most of the other surgeons I&#39;ve seen, so it&#39;s a bit of a wash? And it&#39;s an easy revision, with great long-term aesthetics.)
</p>
<p>
Overall, though, what made me choose them over the other doctors I&#39;ve interacted with in the past was their honesty. I have several older-generation trans friends who had surgery with a specific well-known bay area surgeon, who have had ruinous complications and were never mentioned in that surgeon&#39;s literature. I know for a fact that several of the plastic-surgery oriented surgeons post only their best results, and I&#39;ve seen way less-ideal results from them.
</p>
<p>
I also feel like there are some surgeons who try to &#34;sell&#34; themselves by leaning into the magical thinking that&#39;s common among transwomen.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s my 2Â¢ anyway. ^_^

Good point, I shouldâ€™ve been more specific. Iâ€™m primarily worried about rectovaginal fistula. There is a 2% rate which is of course not bad but itâ€™s still happening in recent time, and some of those I was told stemmed from rectal enterotomy, which is incision into the rectum during operation, which is definitely not great. Like I said, I really like the honesty from their part but itâ€™s not enough to quell my concerns at the moment. Iâ€™m hoping seeing Dr. Wittenberg herself will help calm me down more. (I really donâ€™t understand why they would send everyone to Dr. Bonnington for initial consults even if their primary surgeon is Dr. Wittenberg). Do you mind if I ask you who else you had consults with? Feel free to dm me if you donâ€™t want to talk publicly here. Thank you so much for answering my questions!!

Great questions. I think they&#39;d be better to ask the surgeon&#39;s officeâ€”that data is a little different than what I recall from my consult. Especially when it comes to the enterotomy. A bit of research indicates that it&#39;s a statistically significant complication from laparoscopic abdominal surgery, and that it has been statistically underreported in the past. At any rate, I&#39;m not in possession of the data, but I&#39;ve found their office to be responsive to questions. But ultimately, it&#39;s your decision as to which surgeon you go to, and I certainly am gratified to hear of people doing careful research.
</p>
<p>
As far as Bonnington versus Wittenberg, Bonnington doesn&#39;t have quite the load that Wittenberg has at the moment. When I first signed up for a consult it was a few months to talk to Bonnington, or six to talk to Wittenberg. I did my consultation with Bonnington and surgery with Wittenberg.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, any surgery is a big deal, and this is a relatively major surgery.
</p>
<p>
Sorry this took a bit to get back to you. ^_^

No problem, I appreciate your responses! And itâ€™s a good point that I should look into enterotomy as a complication if laparoscopic abdominal surgery and not just related to vaginoplasty

Wow, your results are excellent (Basically what I would like to have after my SRS), Dr. Wittenberg did an excellent job with your vulva, she has greatly improved her technique for the labia minora, I&#39;m considering having my SRS with her, I have a few questions: What is vaginal lubrication like with PPT? Do you have some degree of self-cleaning or do you douche? Did the laparoscopic approach make your recovery more difficult and increase your pain?

Lubrication is good so far. It&#39;s sufficient for gentle skin-to-skin sex, but expect to supplement with a little additional lube for dilation, toys, or anything more intense. It&#39;s also one of those things that there&#39;s little long-term data on. For now: I definitely get wet and am consistently wet enough to slide a finger into, even without previous day dilation or after douching.
</p>
<p>
That brings me to the next questionâ€”surgeon&#39;s recommendation is generally to douche a few times a week at this point, but I&#39;m finding it generally unnecessary.  I&#39;m sitting at a resting pH of between 4.5 and 5, dilating with pH-matched lube, and overall it seems to stay pretty clean. My partners (one of whom is AFAB) both say it smells and tastes like it should. (Hopefully not TMI)That said, it is a neovagina, and not natal skin; additionally, there are no cervical secretions,  and there&#39;s no long-term data on this technique, so I am douching once every 1.5-2 weeks or so as a precaution. Stuff that goes in definitely comes back out, and things are naturally moist, so I&#39;m evaluating increasing that interval based on smell, pH, and gyn recommendations. My observations so far support a longer interval between douching, but every body (and everybody!) will respond differently.
</p>
<p>
The laproscopic approach left me with five abdominal wall interpenetrations, one of which was invisibly in the belly button and is no longer observable. The other four are in a nice symmetrical pattern, and have faded to a color just slightly darker than my natural fish-belly-white skin tone. ^_^ There was bloating due to insufflation during surgery (think soufflÃ©!), but once the gas was absorbed, there was no pain or additional sensitivity in those areas at all. They&#39;re only discernible now due to the slight discoloration and a bit of a dimple in the subcutaneous fat pad.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
(EDIT: I had &#39;dilating&#39; once every 1.5-2 weeks rather than &#39;douching&#39; once every 1.5-2 weeks. I&#39;m not fully awake yet! I dilate every 2 days-ish!)

That&#39;s awesome that you don&#39;t have to dilate every day now! I&#39;m at almost 8 months and still dilating twice a day most days myself.
</p>
<p>
What kind of ph matched lube do you use? I&#39;ve been using astroglide gel for all my dilation sessions.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to hear your pH (and taste/smell) is good! I&#39;m expecting some pH strips soon myself so I can keep an eye on mine myself.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your continued healing!

I&#39;m dilating pretty much every other day, though I miss one now and again, but honestly I also tend to masturbate (penetratively) in lieu of dilation on some of those days. Sometimes dilation turns into masturbation. Again, probably TMI. I promise I&#39;m not a horndog! lol ... but what I&#39;m getting at is that I tend to spend longer dilating during those sessions ... so 2hrs instead of &#34;10-30 minutes.&#34;
<br>
So far, things have been really stable down there.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve gone through several lubes and settled on &#34;Good Clean Love&#34; &#34;bionude.&#34; Definitely not saying it&#39;s best, but it&#39;s the one I currently use, if that makes sense. Astroglide burns for me, for some reason. It&#39;s extremely unpleasant. I&#39;ve seen other people who&#39;ve experienced that issue, so I know it&#39;s not just me. However, I love how slippery slick it is, so I do sometimes wish I could use it.  I also tried sliquid. It works fine, but I don&#39;t love it.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still in the process of exploring lube option, so this is a work in progress. The &#34;bionude&#34; is good enough, though, for sure.  ^_^

Thanks! I don&#39;t mind the TMI btw. And thanks for the recommendation! I&#39;ve heard others recommend that brand too, so maybe I&#39;ll check it out.
</p>
<p>
Edit: gosh, that&#39;s more than 3x as expensive.... were you able to get it wholesale anywhere?

I just re-read my comment, and I realized that I said &#34;dilate&#34; when I meant &#34;douche.&#34; I dilate every two days-ish, I douche every 1.5-2 weeks. I&#39;m sorry for the confusion. &gt;_&lt;

MoZaic didn&#39;t accept the insurance I had through work, so I paid out of pocket for an insurance plan. The total cost of out-of-pocket insurance, accommodation, and copays was about $25k. I could have done everything (except the copays) more cheaply, but I wanted to cross all the i&#39;s and dot all the t&#39;s on this one. ^_^

Hey there! Thanks so much for sharing your experience with Dr. Wittenberg.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering if you&#39;d be up for sharing what insurance plan you bought and who you bought it from?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m switching insurance plans right now and in my state (Wisconsin) I can&#39;t find an individual insurance plan which covers Wittenberg in-network, even PPO plans. I began to think that maybe only employer PPOs plans covered her but it sounds like you found an option.
</p>
<p>
Thanks much for any information you have time to share!

I got a marketplace Blue Shield platinum PPO from coveredca.com. Out of state insurance is tricky, because a lot of them carry exclusions and such. MoZaic might have more input on the issue, not sure.

Thanks so much for sharing! Since you&#39;re in California that makes sense from my research a marketplace PPO plan would cover her. Yeah, out-of-state is what&#39;s screwing me here. There are employer plans with national PPO networks that cover her but for whatever reason insurance companies seem to just not sell national network PPO plans to individuals.
</p>
<p>
But, I&#39;m going to talk to MoZaic and a local insurance broker before I give up.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again.

Take my comment with a shaker of salt.
</p>
<p>
I heard over the reddit grapevine that PPTV without insurance (self-pay) runs roughly upwards to $100-120k - at least, those are the numbers I have in my notes.
</p>
<p>
I can only imagine PPV would require similar careful laparoscopic navigation, as you&#39;re more or less using the same tissue. I would
<em>
imagine
</em>
it costs a little less since you won&#39;t need any surgical work involving your penis.
</p>
<p>
When it comes time for me to handle my journey, I&#39;ll try to remember to create a full report, though if it&#39;s anything like my vocal surgery, journaling got lost in the excitement and anxiety.

if you don&#39;t mind me asking, how has the physical integrity of the canal been? I&#39;ve heard peritoneum is a bit more fragile than penile skin. have you had any problems on that front?
