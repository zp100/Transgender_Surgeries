I’m almost to the 9 week mark postop. I’ve dilating 3x/day for a bit now. I was cleared for exercise etc almost three weeks ago too now.
</p>
<p>
Right now all I can think about is hitting the 12 week/3 month mark so I can start using the new equipment with another human. I’ve been able to do things myself and everything works very well down there (much better than before surgery).
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me whatever you’d like. I did a previous post around a month ago I think. I answered some questions there when the surgery/hospital part was a bit fresher in my mind if you wanna look there.

-I had a lot of sensation the whole time (almost too much at times when I still had stitches). I don’t have a lot of experience testing the inside with a lot of in/out because I’m not allowed to yet, but I definitely feel things and have strong sensations on the inside. I’m not sure how it will translate when another person gets involved just yet.
</p>
<p>
-yes it was
</p>
<p>
-there’s definitely always moisture internally down there. I can use it just fine when I’m doing things with my hand. I don’t know if it’s enough for another person yet, but I can let you know when I get cleared for that in 3.5 weeks.

Hey, congrats! I&#39;m glad to hear youre recovering smoothly!
</p>
<p>
I have surgery with BBL in almost exactly 11 months -- super stoked. But still only ~10 hrs into hair removal. Any idea how many hours of electrolysis / laser you had? And over how long? Iv been hearing around 20-25 of just straight electrolysis -- I&#39;m fair haired :l
</p>
<p>
Thanks for doing this AMA, and hope the rest of your recovery goes well

I wouldn’t focus so much on the “hours” of electrolysis. It’s going to vary for many reasons, including how efficient your electrolysis person is (some are much faster than others). I did 6 sessions of laser while doing electrolysis because I have both dark and light hair down there. I did electrolysis around a year and had an apt each month where the bottom areas in need of attention were cleared (each took between 30 min and 1.5 hr, but I had an ambidextrous electrolysis person who was very efficient). My advice would be to work with them to plan clearings across a year to a year and a half because you should be focusing on hitting the hairs in all the growth cycles more than anything.

Glad you&#39;re doing well. In addition to questions asked above, I have one.
</p>
<p>
How soon were you able to get back to normal, work etc?  I am a truck driver and am curious to how long I would have to be out of work.

I didn’t have “work” to go back to. All my stuff was over zoom, so I didn’t have to go anywhere and/or sit/stand for long periods. I will say that by the 3rd week mark I was pretty okay walking around and sitting for quite a while, but it’d get uncomfortable sitting (not standing) after 1.5ish hours. That went away somewhere in the 4-6 week mark.

Hi, hope you&#39;re doing well! Certainly sounds like you&#39;re happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
Is there anything you wish you would have done differently or known about as you were waiting for surgery? My consult date with BBL is in December 2021 (plan on calling and trying to get moved up the lit) and I&#39;m curious if there is anything that will smooth things along.
</p>
<p>
I know from the last post that you&#39;re from NYC, but coming from out of town I&#39;ll be cooped up in a hotel for about a month. How mobile were you after a couple of weeks? Like could you go on a walk a few blocks around the city, or was that too much?

I don’t know that there’s anything I would do differently. I had some hiccups along the way, but they didn’t have anything to do with choices/preparation. I would urge you to be aggressive with getting hair removal as soon as you can, but that’s just because it takes a while and you’ll have time with how long her waiting list.
</p>
<p>
The first week at home, I was pretty much around the house, but I could get around my apartment just fine. The second week is when I started venturing out more. You have to build up your stamina, but I was fine walking around a few blocks and sitting outside for some meals by the end of the 2nd week (sitting for too long got uncomfortable after a bit and I always stayed within 1-2 blocks from home because that’s where all the supplies for dilating/bathroom/etc. were when needed).

I get between the last two dots on my dilator depending on where you measure from (which part of lips). It’s somewhere between 5.5 and 6 inches I believe.
</p>
<p>
And that area was the last part to have the stitches dissolve, so I don’t know that it’s done changing. Right now there’s definitely a distinction between the two, but I don’t have super prominent interior lips that stick out or anything.

Toilets a bit strange because you really don’t have much control of how things are directed. Much more wiping/cleanup as a result.
</p>
<p>
Crossing legs I don’t notice much difference honestly. I’ve always been a person who crosses my legs a lot and that hasn’t changed.

Thanks for doing this.  I’m now less than 9 days out from my surgery with her, and things like this are really reassuring.

Did you do the pelvic floor physical therapy piece?  How did that work?

So glad to help and congrats, you’re so close.
</p>
<p>
I did 2-3(I think it was only 2) pelvic floor apts and then I stopped. I had enough other medical/non-medical apts already and I personally didn’t find them that helpful because I didn’t have any issues with dilation (dilation has been pretty easy for me to be honest, so your mileage may vary). I’d say try at least 1-2 apts, but don’t feel obligated to make more if you aren’t having any issues.

The surgeon’s office implied they’d just be “scheduled right around your post-op appointments”, but scheduling with PT it looks like they’ll either be on different days (like 2 days after discharge) or several hours after my 1st post-op.  I’m just a bit concerned about how much energy/mobility I’ll have handling the extra trips out.
</p>
<p>
I’m not local to NYC, so getting around Manhattan while recovering during Covid is a bit intimidating already.

I don’t know where you’re staying, but taking ubers for apts really isn’t bad. The only reason the subway isn’t an option early on is because of the stairs.
</p>
<p>
Also I didn’t have my apts right away. My first one got cancelled and rescheduled for like my 3rd week of recovery and I made my 2nd/3rd apt for around my 6 week mark so I could try out the orange dilator with them. My advice is really not to worry to much about the apts. do what you can and what is best for you. They aren’t something you can’t live without. They are mainly to check on your progress/make sure you’re not slacking off, so if you’re staying on top of everything, they aren’t crucial.
</p>
<p>
Also: plan your dilations around the apt on a day you have one. You will be dilating at the apts so plan your other dilations around it so you aren’t doing 5 dilations in a day when you don’t need to.

Thanks for this. I’ve read about the recommendation for P.T. in the surgery packet (Preparing for Surgery - Vaginoplasty (v8.2020)) and was wondering how this was going to work. It is recommended to have at least one appointment pre-surgery. Did you have a pre-surgery appointment? If so what was that like/about?

I did not have any pre-surgery and I don’t really think it’d be worth doing pre-surgery. The apts are heavily centered in dilation and you can’t really do any of that pre-surgery.

Very good. It’s amazing to not have to think about tucking or any of that bottom dysphoria anymore. The worst that happens nowadays is camel toe, and that’ll get better with time as swelling continues to go down.

Thanks for this...my surgery with Bluebond / Zhao is in three months and always reassuring to hear more positive experiences.
</p>
<p>
Question: did you feel that you really needed help around the apartment after two-weeks post-surgery. I have people coming into town for the first 10 days after discharge but not the last few days in NYC. Thoughts?

I would say it’s possible to be okay alone if you prepare yourself. By this I mean have ways around lifting things set in place. You aren’t supposed to lift anything heavy for the first 6 weeks or something like that. I for example got one of the grocery cart things so I would be able to get groceries without having to carry heavy bags. Additionally, I’d try to be on top of going on short walks before they leave you. You want to have at least some stamina/have gone on walks with them already in case you have times were you start feeling tired or faint in the middle.

Kevin sent me the packet that included “Prepare for Surgery Heal Faster Q &amp; A,” which offers a mind-body preparation program. Did you take advantage of this? If so, what are your thoughts? I plan to arrive in the area a week prior to surgery and will have time to schedule in these things in my planning.

I didn’t do any of the “heal faster” things. It wasn’t really something that appealed to me personally so I can’t really comment. If mindfulness exercises are your thing, maybe it’ll help 🤷🏼‍♀️.

Yes, she isn’t super strict with getting to completely clear before surgery, but she wants you to get as close to that as you can while waiting for your surgery.
