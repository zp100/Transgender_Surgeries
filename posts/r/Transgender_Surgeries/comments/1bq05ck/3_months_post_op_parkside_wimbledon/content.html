As the title says, I am coming up on 3 months since I had gender affirming surgery (SRS/GRS) with Mr James Bellringer. I funded this PIV surgery privately as I could not face the 10 years + wait on the nhs, (I was first referred to the nhs in 2021 hence long wait).
</p>
<p>
This isn’t a detailed review/reflection, but hopefully gives an insight into my experiences.
</p>
<p>
First, I liked Mr Bellringer’s humour. Although I understand that as someone else in a previous post has said - his humour can be like marmite. Something that really impressed me about my experience with Mr Bellringer was how quickly he got to the hospital when my catheter stopped working on day 2 post-op. I was in a lot of discomfort, and having a panic attack, but he was with me within 20-30 minutes, (I wasn’t timing so it may have been a lot quicker to be honest - time felt slower due to my panic attack). I am pleased I chose Mr Bellringer, particularly for his direct answers to any of my questions, (such as possible effects of the catheter complication).
</p>
<p>
I am really happy with the surgery result. I had my check-up last week, and Mr Bellringer was also pleased with how everything is healing. While I had external granulation  - this seems to have healed by itself so no silver nitrate was needed.
</p>
<p>
While there is scarring, it is fading well - almost can’t see it in some areas. I am massaging the area twice a day with bio-oil.
</p>
<p>
I have good sensation on the labia and clitoris, (I just climaxed today for the first time post op, using fingers only on the clit - it was such an intense, full body experience). I have 6.5-7 inches depth.
</p>
<p>
I have been grateful to the specialist nurse, who I checked in with weekly for the first 8 weeks via email, who was always providing reassurance and guidance. I emailed Mr Bellringer once about the granulation, and he replied within a few hours which also impressed me.
</p>
<p>
As others have said, food at Parkside, Wimbledon is amazing. Although, as a vegetarian the options did get rather repetitive. Definitely recommend the pancakes for breakfast though! Unfortunately, I had a rather bad UTI which meant I couldn’t enjoy the food in the last few days. The UTI was a complication associated with the catheter issue. Mr Bellringer had warned me a UTI was likely, after he fixed the catheter.
</p>
<p>
I hope sharing my experiences is useful. Happy to answer any questions.

I&#39;m interested to read this. I&#39;ve often seen him reported as a butcher and rather uncaring, funny how the same guy can be portrayed in two very different ways!

Funnily enough he mainly did my check ups , Ms Rashid did my surgery . But he was really nice and funny ime . His humour can be marmite but I enjoyed it , he even came in on my last day as I was leaving having biked to Parkside during torrential rain and he came in  looking like a drowned rat ,laughing and joking about it as he passed me .

I&#39;ve seen these posts too. I think generally speaking, people are more likely to share a negative experience than a positive one. If he is doing a number of ops a week times by a 24 year career, he has to be doing something right.

That wasn’t how he was with me and I love my results, but I have seen him reported as being that way too hence why I wanted to share my experience.
