I would look for a revision surgeon that does PPT or colon. You will likely be travelling for this. Expect some surgeons to turn you down as revisions are less common than primary vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I think most of your complaints can be handled in a revision. The erectile tissue can be excised. The clit will can probably(?) have some treatment options although without the original donor tissue it may not be as sensitive or aesthetically pleasing.
</p>
<p>
Try to stay calm. You’re not the first person whose primary was unsatisfactory. A lot of people have been in your shoes.

I recommend Dr. Theerapong (from Thailand), he is very good with aesthetics and revision surgeries, I saw that you also have problems with vaginal depth  and that could be remedied with the sigmoid colon technique (the technique he does the most)

Unfortunately not really. I haven’t had mine yet and am looking to get it done by Min Jun now that he takes my insurance.
</p>
<p>
Check the wiki. There’s probably a lot you can find on who to go to and who to avoid.

I’m so excited to hear Min Jun is taking OHIP. I wonder how that could work out for the rest of us non-ON girls. I’m in AB (sorry), and am have been searching for the right surgeon. If Min Jun is a possibility… well, that decision gets made pretty easily!

Just come move here for a couple years. Honestly he might be worth it if there’s no other way. I was in the same boat as you. The moment he was a choice, he became my choice.

Easier said than done when you’re 47 with a wife and kids. Wife with a newly stable job, been at my company for 23 years, and kids would be heading to university by the time it becomes a reality. It would probably cost me more to move out there than it would if I was out of pocket for surgery (loss of land/house value/ loss of career/etc). May AB healthcare and OHIP cross somehow. I mean, AB covers for going through Brassard in Montreal… I’ll have to investigate. As far as I know PIV is the only option in Montreal, and I’m heavily leaning PPT, so Min Jun is preferable that way. Also: the beautiful results! I’m happy for you that Min Jun is an easier option for you.

I tried Min Jun 2 years ago for aesthetics  having a video Consult ( I live in BC Canada , Genoway here is a joke for any of these surgeries for Trans women ! ) - he gas lit me said it looks great and yet it was a mess playing mind games with me suggesting seeing a psychologist basically - I was shocked at his not caring but when your from Canada and not on American Insurance ! there’s No money in it for him really - the consult was about 35 minutes and he wouldn’t touch me and suggested a Cosmetic Plastic Surgeon and he doesn’t do it  WTF ! Wow ! - just a crock of sh#t really , Ontario he accepts and they’ll pay , very interesting , never from BC’s medical garbage spouted off ?  - I’m still trying over 4 plus years on aesthetics- Even Theerapong’s Colon Revision works well last 2022 fall time but he did nothing for aesthetics paid for and  it looks the same post op from Kamols original SRS Jun 2019 , I give up with these Surgeons because they really don’t want to touch other surgeons mess’s created ? I’m legit about this and not some post op bitching idiot expecting too much - It does not look good at all “ The Leaning Tower Of Pisa “
</p>
<p>
To fix my mess you’d have to treat it like a 1 st time SRS and open everything up again to pull skin into place properly - Try and find a surgeon willing , impossible post op original mess created - Min Jun has the skills just didn’t want to deal with me and left a bad taste in my mouth when he says in video he cares - he wants you 1 st time only in reality - tried and refused long ago by him ?

The problem is that Dr. Min Jun has no skill in revision surgeries, he has very little or no experience with revision surgeries.

I second this. He did fine with some of my aesthetics. Mines acceptable but I want more done. And my depth after revision is like 3.5 to 4 inches. He told me wouldn’t do more but I’m consulting other doctors because it feels more like a technique limitation than a physiological one. He gave me different answers every time I asked him why he couldn’t extend my canal. Great for primary surgery though. My sister went to him and has great depth and aesthetics.
