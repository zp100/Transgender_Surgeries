I hope your recovery is going well :) How was your experience with him? I&#39;ve heard pretty terrible things from that surgeon, including stories of him mentally abusing his patients and blaming them whenever complications happen, was your experience better than that?
</p>

(link below is to an example)

As for the hospital care, through insurance the clinic in CABA in which he operates is great and the nurses were super caring (Do be prepared to eat the blandest food ever while staying there).
</p>
<p>
I will not deny that he is a very odd man and i 100% believe he has some sort of condition. Not necessarily that he&#39;s a psycho tho, he struck me as being somewhere in the autism spectrum.
</p>
<p>
I think he does minimize a bit any issues there may be, and doesn&#39;t recommend anything else than Platsul to fix them, which is why he now refers patients to pelvic floor therapists and a specialist wound care nurse.
</p>
<p>
In my case i lost most of my right labia minora, most likely due to an infection which would have most likely been prevented by using the proper dressing. Luckily the wound care nurse managed to revert it and i was back to normal within days. It did take a lot of effort to remove the slough that was left on that side though.
</p>
<p>
As for depth, i have 6 inches and am already on the third dilator, which is 3.5 cm and only the first insertion hurts a bit. I also still use the thinnest dilator for depth.
</p>
<p>
I have full sensation in the clitoris and had some numbness in the labia but that is coming back already so i&#39;m not worried, i managed to get some pleasurable feelings (not orgasm yet tho) even so im happy with that. The clitoral hood and (im not 100% sure) the back of the vulva is built with foreskin grafts, so those areas are sensitive too.
</p>
<p>
I do not expect it to heal to aesthetic perfection, and my labia will likely remain asymmetrical unless i get a revision. Still, the result is better than i expected, the vaginal canal is inside the labia and it&#39;s already pretty much perfect with my legs closed so im satisfied. I will post pics again on 3 months as that is when the surgeon says you can make a true first assestment of the results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Would i recommend belinky as a surgeon?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Honestly, there are some things he could do better, and he could be really really good if he fixed them. SRS is such a complex surgery that wound aftercare is just as important as the specific cuts and sutures of the skin. Still, it was likely my only chance of getting SRS and for many trans women here in argentina it is too.
</p>
<p>
If you are going to pay out of pocket, are american or have to travel anyways, just go to Thailand or any surgeon you can get many pictures of that satisfy you. I would imagine it costing about as much and your experience will be more predictable due to many more experiences being posted on forums for those surgeons.
</p>
<p>
If you are able to get his surgery covered by insurance however, it&#39;s a pretty good option. I have a functional vulva and vagina, which looks mostly like the real thing with some hiccups when spread and completely indistinguishable with my legs closed.
<strong>
To me
</strong>
that is enough, and that is why i decided to get the surgery in the first place. YMMV
