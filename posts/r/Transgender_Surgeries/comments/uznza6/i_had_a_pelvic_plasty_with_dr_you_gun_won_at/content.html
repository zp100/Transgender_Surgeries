<p>
Earlier this month I flew to Seoul, S. Korea with my brother to become the first westerner to undergo a pelvic plasty with Dr You gun Won at Yonsei Baro Chuk hospital. 35mm titanium implants were screwed to my iliac crests, and silicon padding was also inserted to smooth out the overall shape. Only around 50 other women, (some cis, some trans) have undergone the procedure so far and these are all women from Korea, Vietnam, China etc. So the severe lack of information on English-speaking forums did give me some cause for concern, but this is me trying to do something about that.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/f9dw28dnj8291.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b693fd4835701f654dfa472b6436ef9a3d812f5">Recovering in my private room in the hospital, the day after surgery</a>
</p>
<p>
The operation was performed on the 11th May 2022 and so it&#39;s now been 2.5 weeks. The first evening immediately after surgery was painful and no fun at all. But once I&#39;d been given some decent pain medication I did manage to sleep for a few hours - much more than I had after my FFS, that&#39;s for sure. I then spent 7 days after surgery recovering in the hospital. Communication was tricky at times - most of the staff do not really speak English so Google Translate in Conversation mode proved very useful! However, throughout my stay both the hospital staff and my coordinator, William, were extremely helpful and friendly and they really went out of their way to make me comfortable. Oh and the hospital food was generally pretty amazing - although somedays seaweed soup and boiled rice for breakfast was a bit much even for me! On the 8th day I flew home to Norway (that first 14 hour flight to Helsinki wasn&#39;t much fun) to continue my recovery. From initially being completely immobile in the hospital bed, I&#39;m now able to walk at a slow/average pace fairly naturally and without too many problems. I&#39;ve been told that in another couple of weeks I should be ok to start running at an easy pace.
</p>
<p>
So far I&#39;m very happy with the results. Before the surgery I was extremely dysphoric about my body shape, particularly my lack of curves around the hips. When going out I would almost always wear silicon padding, held in place with shape-wear. Now I don&#39;t need any of that. When I look at my body in the mirror I recognise that my pelvis is feminine in appearance and I absolutely love it! It should probably be mentioned at this point that I&#39;ve just turned 46 and have been on HRT for about a year so I&#39;m hoping to see some additional fat redistribution around the thighs and hips on top of what I have managed to achieve so far, mainly through the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The recovery has been manageable. I took the stitches out myself a few days ago and while my left hip looks perfect, my right hip wound is still draining fluid. My local GP assures me that the wound looks like it&#39;s healing nicely and blood tests confirm there is no infection.
</p>
<p>
If you are considering this surgery I hope you find this post helpful.
</p>
<p>
[Edit] A few days after posting this my right hip wound began leaking silicon gel which caused me great distress. I was admitted to a local hospital and the plastic surgeon there explained that the silicon gel pack had ruptured. I suspect this happened very early on judging by how different the recovery of the two wounds has been. I now need to travel back to Seoul for a revision within the next 6-12 months otherwise the silicon will poison my lymphatic system. Obviously this is extremely disappointing as I was hoping I would be able to recommend this procedure whole-heartedly, however this now has be tempered with a reminder that there are very clearly real risks involved. If you do elect to have this procedure I hope this doesnâ€™t happen to you too x

Thanks for posting. This is the first time.
</p>
<p>
How much did it cost?
</p>
<p>
How big are  the incisions, and where are they?
</p>
<p>
Do you have any idea of the complication rate?

It cost approx $20,000 after claiming some of the VAT back at the airport. Unfortunately my deposit was exempt from a VAT refund because I&#39;d paid it in the previous calendar year - something to be aware of.
</p>
<p>
The incisions are very close to the implant site on the front side of my tummy, angled diagonally down (pointing towards my crotch) . They are currently hidden by all but the skimpiest of underwear and obviously I&#39;m hoping the scarring will improve significantly with time. In length they are about 4-5 cm.
</p>
<p>
Sorry, no idea about complication rates. Probably a good question to ask the clinic directly.

Whatâ€™s the VAT thing about?
</p>
<p>
How does this compare to BBL?
</p>
<p>
Silicone gels are good for scarring.

Just the same as purchases of goods in foreign countries (eg while on holiday) are often VAT refundable, most of the surgery costs are too, so long as you don&#39;t already live in S.Korea
</p>
<p>
BBLs for increasing hip size use either fat-transfer or silicon implants but I noticed that they can often seem to sit a bit lower when compared to the pelvis of a cis-woman. They can also be prone to shifting with time apparently. The titanium implants I have are screwed directly to the highest part of the pelvis (the iliac crest). As such they have &#39;raised&#39; the point of where my hips are, making my waist appear narrower, my legs longer and reducing the apparent height of my torso, creating a more natural look. Also they won&#39;t shift position.
</p>
<p>
Yeah thanks, I got some Silicon gel provided by the hospital :)

You look exhausted but so happy! My hips make me super dysphoric as well. Posting here since I will be using this as a reference for later. Thank you so much for sharing! ðŸ’‹
</p>
<p>
I seem to be getting all of my surgery contacts here on reddit. FFS, GRS, TS, VFS, and now pelvic plasty! (Not that I will need them all, but I have my info now!)
</p>
<p>
Just so others know, there is an order that the surgeons will want them in, with Vocal Feminization Surgery last, due to intubations messing with stuff.
</p>
<p>
I wish I would have known about this when I was living in Korea for work.
</p>
<p>
I also wish I knew about HRT when I was a kid. Holy crap it would have solved allot, if not all of my depression issues (since that is where they came from)

I think it&#39;s a pretty common feeling ðŸ’œ When I came across this procedure in my research for transition I knew straight away it was something I really wanted.
</p>
<p>
But to address your surgery-order comment... I&#39;ve had VFS and before the pelvic plasty I ensured the anaesthetist was made aware of it too. My VFS surgeon (Dr Hess - Hamburg) had recommended that so long as any future surgeon intubates with a tube no greater than 5.5mm diameter, it should cause no damage to the vocal folds. But anyway I was assured in Seoul that it was not a problem. I was given an epidural and then... hmm it gets hazy at this point... but basically I don&#39;t believe they needed to intubate ðŸ˜…

I figured they could use an LMA airway since that is common practice in allot of day surgeries. I was just told by my FFS surgeon that he couldn&#39;t do the VFS and FFS at the same time and wanted me to wait until after I was done with all of the procedures that I was going to have due to the intubation factor. But that may just be his personal preference.

If you want to change the id marker
<em>
in most eu countries
</em>
you need srs so if possible try to get FFS and SRS relatively close
<em>
or get them at the same if you are brave
</em>
so everything else is secondary + you can go on pellets that last anywhere from 4-8 months

Just thought I&#39;d post another update on my ongoing situation.
</p>
<p>
Up until 2 weeks ago I was under the impression that my wound was slowly healing. It had closed up finally and stopped leaking however walking was gradually getting more and more difficult and my right hip was very stiff and sore. Then the wound burst and a large amount of puss and blood erupted forth, soaking my clothes. After spending 6.5 hours waiting in A&amp;E in a hospital in Plymouth, I was seen by a doctor who posited the best explanation I&#39;ve yet heard for my symptoms.
</p>
<p>
It seems likely that a low-level bacterial infection is lurking within the silicon gel. Despite the various courses of antibiotics I&#39;ve taken the infection remains as there is no blood supply within the gel and it can hide there dormant, ready to flourish again when each course ends. My wound slowly heals, despite the draining but then the pus builds up and bursts out. This cycle will continue until I can get the ruptured silicon pack and the leaked gel completely removed from my hip cavity and the infection cleared. As soon as I return to Norway from my holiday in the UK I plan to admit myself to hospital to this end.
</p>
<p>
And once I&#39;m given the all-clear and have zero infection I plan to fly back to Seoul and have the pack replaced.
</p>
<p>
This has obviously had, and continues to have a huge negative impact on my quality of life. I&#39;m hopeful that it will still all work out eventually but for now it&#39;s basically ruined my summer.
</p>
<p>
A friend recently asked if I regret having the surgery. The answer remains &#39;no&#39;, but I really can&#39;t wait for this sorry state of affairs to be behind me so I can return to living my life without constantly having to tend and dress my hip wound, along with dealing with the ever-present discomfort and stabs of pain.
</p>
<p>
I wish this was better news and hope my next update will be more positive.

I wonder if they considered fat graft rather than silicone padding. The risk of osteomyelitis with titanium bone implant is quite high. I reckon a surgeon should use something less likely to retain biofilm next to the bone implant.

is the silicon padding mandatory? Would it still look ok without it or would it just make it look like a ridge poking out of your side?  I thought one of the advantages of this technique was that it didn&#39;t involve silicone

Hi, no it&#39;s not mandatory. They said some patients opt not to have them. I haven&#39;t seen any photos of the results when silicon pads were not used so I don&#39;t know how it looks without.

where on your body did they put the silicon implants?  is it over the trochanter (like the femur pelvis joint) the way that most hip silicone implants are, or somewhere else?

Thanks for the write up! What the total changes in your measurements that you&#39;re expecting after the swelling goes down?

You&#39;re welcome! The swelling is really minimal at this point. The CT Scan picture I included shows the initial pelvic width to be 295mm and the new extended width to be 328mm - it&#39;s an increase of around 11%
</p>
<p>
How that translates to dress size measurement isn&#39;t clear to me, at least not yet. Most of my pre-surgery clothing fit pretty well with the hip pads in and now most of my clothes fit in a similar fashion but without. Skirts (like the one pictured) just seem to fit and hang better on my body. It&#39;s really awesome :D
</p>
<p>
I did try to measure circumference recently with a piece of string. Not sure if I was doing it right - it&#39;s easier with some help - but  I saw maybe I&#39;d gained about an inch in my hip measurement. Initially I was a bit confused by this, but I think this measurement is a bit misleading. Because my hips sit higher up now, where previously the widest point encompassed my butt, now the widest point sits higher. Basically, even though the overall measurements aren&#39;t substantially wider, the geometry seems to have changed significantly :)

Thanks for your post - very intriguing.  Having seen your CT, I could see a curved metal material on the outside of your anterior pelvic crest. However, there is less dense material between the bone and metal, would you happen to know what it is? Hope your infection gets better. Based on what you said, itâ€™s probably formed an abscess beneath the silicone implant. Did the Plymouth doctor suggest keeping a drain in or debriding the wound and removing the silicone implant then IV antibiotics? Also did they grow the bacteria to see what type they are? Infection around titanium implant can lead to osteomyelitis and it can be difficult to treat.

Hi, the implant isn&#39;t solid - it&#39;s hollow with only specific contact points to screw to the bone. That slice in the scan didn&#39;t capture that part but as to what is in there, I&#39;ve no idea. &#39;Body stuff&#39;?
</p>
<p>
The Doctor in Plymouth said I could be admitted to remove the ruptured pack and loose gel, and I was tempted but it was around midnight, I was exhausted after the wait and just wanted to go home. Also, I knew that would be the end of my holiday and I was still hoping I could make a success of it (I couldn&#39;t). No tests of the bacteria were made, or tests of any kind.

I&#39;m heading back to Seoul on Sunday (July 31st) so Yonsei Baro Chuk can finally take care of it.

Do you have any before and after photos? You posted the result but without the context of what you looked at before im having a hard time envisioning the procedure results.

Iâ€™ve since had a revision so those measurements are no longer accurate, see further down where I link to it. Regardless the difference was noticeable then and even more so now, but I think it depends on your overall body size and how wide your pelvis is to start with. For smaller women the difference after getting the implants is more marked than for larger women.

Does it mean that your pelvis now is more noticeable compare to first couple of months?
