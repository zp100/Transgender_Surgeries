Awesome results! I&#39;m also a patient of hers, had my surgery a couple of months earlier than yours. Very happy with the results too. Good luck with the recovery!

I had mine with her 5 1/2 months ago and it looks a lot like yours. I’m thrilled with mine. I think she does fabulous work.

Totally agree! I had another surgery with her a few months later and the results again exceeded all my expectations. The whole experience was one of the best highlights of my life. I&#39;d love to relive these moments again. But it looks like I&#39;m done with my surgeries.
</p>
<p>
FWIW. Dr. McGinn typically doesn&#39;t bill the insurance. I had to submit a claim. I have to say that my insurance reimbursed 100% of her costs of the surgery.

Can I ask what insurance you have? I am leaning towards McGinn but have been worried about the insurance side of things

I am now just over 6 months post-op with Dr. McGinn. I am happy with my result, but I am consider a minor revision labiaplasty to get more labia minora and to cover the lower end of the vaginal orifice better. I am also considering some medical tattooing to make the labia minora and part of the vestibule more pink looking.
</p>
<p>
I have around 6.25 inches of depth. I can get the orange dilator to around 6 inches fairly easily, but I usually have stretch with the smaller dilators first. I do self-lubricate when I get aroused, and pleasure feels amazing. I have yet to have an orgasm, but haven&#39;t really masturbated a lot either, so that&#39;s probably why. Without me spreading my labia and having light directly at the vulva, it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell that it was surgically created. The scars are fading nicely, but still a little bit pink.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

I&#39;ll echo that this is one of the best results I&#39;ve seen- congrats!! You&#39;re not the only one who can&#39;t tell it was created surgically.

Standing up you can not tell, but the scars are still visible due to the pink color, so if you examined the area with good lightning like in this picture, you would be able to tell.

I stayed at Gaia House for the first bit of recovery! Loved the place and the people that work there are amazing!

Okay so i think this post solidified my choice. I&#39;m still a bit out from srs, because for her I&#39;d probably have to pay out of pocket but just from what I&#39;ve mostly heard it seems like she&#39;s be my choice. I&#39;d likely have a trachea shave with her too.

No worries! The vaginal orifice and the urethra are two different &#34;holes&#34;. The urethra is located between the clitoris and the vaginal orifice.

A quality vaginoplasty result has everything in the same place anatomically as a cis vagina. All of the well regarded surgeons perform it this way.

McGinn is very reasonably priced compared to most other US surgeons.  She doesn&#39;t bill insurance directly, but does work with most of them, including supporting documentation for being &#34;in-network&#34;.  I do understand that vaginoplasty is not cheap in general.

What other surgeons were you looking at before you decided on McGinn? I&#39;m currently in the research phase of things and McGinn seems like a good option. Obviously your results are great, but what made you choose McGinn over anyone else? Is she local to you?

I was originally looking at Suporn, Bella Avanessian and Dr. McGinn. My insurance covered all of them, but I decided against Suporn/Dr. Banks due to inconvenience. I contacted Mount Sinai first, but their intake process was horrible and I simply gave up. Not a great first impression at all. I called Dr. McGinn&#39;s office, and they were really helpful. Scheduled me for a consultation two months out, and after talking to Dr. McGinn and being thoroughly impressed by their entire team, I decided that it would be a good choice for me.
</p>
<p>
I decided on Dr. McGinn for the follow reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Her clinic was within driving distance of where I live. This makes post-op appointments, revision surgeries and quite frankly the entire process far move convenient.
</li>
<li>
She is one of the most experienced SRS surgeons in the world and has produced good and reliable results for over a decade. I found very few negative reviews from patients, and most of the people I talked to were very happy with their results in highly recommended her.
</li>
<li>
She runs a small clinic and her entire team is incredibly responsive. Emails were answered quickly and they were good at following up.
</li>
<li>
She operates out of a very modern hospital, and runs her own guest house, making the entire process enjoyable. You always feel like you are in good hands with staff and the surgeon only being minutes away and available 24/7.
</li>
</ul>

Thanks for all the info. She was already on my short list.
</p>
<p>
A 2 month wait for the consultation seems really good, how long did you have to wait for the surgery?
</p>
<p>
Fab result btw, I hope you are happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Do you get any input on aesthetics prior to surgery or an indication of what she thinks is achievable? I understand a lot is limited by personal biology but just trying to get a better idea of what&#39;s covered in the consultation.

I had my consultation 2 months out and the surgery 6 months after my consolation. I am sure I could have gotten a date between 4-6 months out, but I needed to get some more hair removal done, and had some other plans for the summer.
</p>
<p>
I did not get any input on aesthetics prior to the surgery, because I did not ask. I  did ask her about depth and sensitivity, but nothing specifically about aesthetics. The consultation is ultimately what you make it, so if you want to talk about that I am sure she is more than willing to do so.

Fwiw, I recently booked a consult with McGinn and was given a date in November. I suspect they’re getting booked up with covid winding down.
</p>
<p>
I’m going with her based on what everyone else has pointed out: solid and consistent results, organized staff, wait list isn’t years out, and driving distance for east coasters.

She was not in-network with my insurance company, and her waiting list was 2-3 years, so I decided against consulting with her. I personally preferred the results of Suporn and Dr. McGinn over those from Dr. Bowers as well.

Something I&#39;ve heard 2nd hand about Dr Bowers is that it can be very difficult to get a hold of her if complications arise. She is a huge asset to the trans community, but that means she is very busy with travel/talks/conferences/etc.
</p>
<p>
Mcginn and her team seem to have everything down to a science. The huge difference in wait times between them speaks to that too.

Yes! You got it right.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of PPT. Typically with PPT you don&#39;t get sensitivity in your vagina. This sensitivity is very critical for vaginal orgasms.

Dr. McGinn is in New Hope, Pennsylvania, and performs surgeries just across the river in New Jersey.  You can check the wiki for this subreddit.

I&#39;m only 8 weeks out so ive still got a lot of swelling and I&#39;m actually ok with where things are at right now.  But if after I look half as good as you I&#39;ll be very very happy. My actual concern right now is I still can&#39;t really feel my clit. But that may just take time too

I barely knew where my clitoris was until the two month appointment haha. I am sure that you will regain sensitivity when the swelling goes down. Did you have sensitivity when she tested your clitoral response during the second post-op appointment?

Oh I went to a different surgeon actually. Sorry if I made it seem like I also went to McGinn. I was just admiring her work lol.  But my last appointment with my surgeon in person was in February and still so early that they couldn&#39;t test that and I live a few states away. I have a follow up virtual appointment with my surgeon on Tuesday and I&#39;m going to talk to him about it though.

Nono, you are good! I apologize for assuming! Hopefully everything will be just fine! Sensitivity usually comes back when swelling goes down!

It&#39;s alright l0l.  I actually went to Dr Pang at Mt Sinai. He was great and I am so far very happy with my visual results. Even had a medical situation a few weeks ago and several drs and an obgyn complimented me and his work lol.  But he&#39;d encouraged me to try and explore the  sensitivity about 2 weeks ago and just, well nothing. So I&#39;m hoping the swelling is just the case and that I wasn&#39;t unlucky lol

Sensation is great! I really enjoy both g-spot and clitoral stimulation, but I have yet to orgasm. I rarely masturbate so that is probably why lol. My clitoris is fairly small and well hidden under the clitoral hood.

Wow, excellent results! How was the post op recovery? How much dilation was required and for how long? If you stayed at Gaia house, what was your impression? I have a consult with McGinn in May. Hoping to have SRS with her this upcoming fall.  Thanks!

She does great work! If I lived in the US, she’d be the Dr I’d go to.

Such a natural looking result! I’m considering either Kamol or Suporn. Can I ask, is yours PPV?

1) this is stellar work. I can only hope for surgical magic like this.
</p>
<p>
2) thanks for the variety of camera shots. The typical head on look is limiting when wanting to get an idea of the silhouette ones bits can strike.
</p>
<p>
3) congrats! Again! Stellar job. Like you won pussy lotto

Hi, I have a couple of questions: How was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors (It&#39;s on my short list and I have doubts who to go with)? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos (is one of the best results than i ver seen of Dr. Christine McGinn)? And if you opt for revision surgery or medical tattooing, What elements of your vulva would you like to improve?, How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery
</p>
