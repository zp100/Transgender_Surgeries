So I was wondering down the rabbit hole the last few days looking for ffs surgeons and doing my research (I’m a little obsessive) before booking my surgery. I came across two names:
</p>
<p>
Dr Taskov, Germany  Dr Ann Sluzky, Russia
</p>
<p>
The result of both of them are to die for. I was so impressed I started looking for every post, before after pic, testimonials etc. Dr Sluzky in particular looks phenomenal, before ffs and taking a CT scan she will make a 3D plaster cast out your skull to customise the sinus bone work. I mean...I was speechless. Unfortunately the website is all in Russian but her ig page is amazing, if u wanna take a look her practice is called FACEMAKERMOSKVA. Im in the process to book a consult with her because her work is the one that really got me excited in YEARS!  Dr Taskov is also an amazing craniofacial surgeon from what I see, he specialise of type 3 forehead reconstruction. I will contact him too.  What do yall think? Has any of you happen to know one of these surgeons? I mean I can’t believe they re not more mainstream being so good at doing ffs!

Honestly it&#39;s probably because Russia is the last place would think to go for FFS. I&#39;ve never heard of her before, but will tentatively agree she seems interesting. Prices aren&#39;t bad either.
</p>
<p>
I tend to be skeptical of before and after pictures though, no one is going to show bad pictures, and she&#39;s been operating for years.
</p>
<p>
As for the supposed danger of going to Moscow, there really isn&#39;t. Just present in the gender you most look like when there and you would be fine.

Well I actually have my passport with female name and gender, so I guess it’s not a problem. From what I understand she operate mostly on Russian and balkans girls, but I’m interested cause I have Nordic features and it looks like she knows how to handle that. I’ll ask If I can have a face to face consult first obvs and I’ll try to talk w some girls, she sees patient in Berlin. I’m sceptical too and for many many reason cause it all looks too good to be true, but I’m an investigative personality lol so il dig the hell out of it.

Taskov does perform FFS just for one or two years now. He&#39;s also purely a plastic surgeon, not a maxillofacial surgeon. Besides a weird story from someone I knew before 2 years about her SRS consultation with him, I haven&#39;t heard anything bad about him. I&#39;ve read a lot of reviews from a girl who did SRS, BA and FFS with him. She was really happy with him and trusted him completely. Her result was great. In my opinion a little aggressive and much... But objectively seen not at bad result... I personally would wait until he has more experience. But it seems like he&#39;s doing a good job.

In my opinion, he removes too much brow bossing/orbital rims. But that&#39;s just my opinion. Take a look at some of his results on Instagram and see for yourself :)

I have looked at his results but I can’t fully tell. Hmm. Maybe I can ask him to not remove excessive amounts. Like to focus on it looking natural.

I feel like you should not go to Russia for surgery. It&#39;s pretty fucked up country so anything could happen. I don&#39;t live there but it sounds super fucked. And if something went wrong you would probably be your own with it Edit. Typo

Thailand is a very good country, I know what I&#39;m talking about, and people who have changed their gender are treated very friendly.

This is the only country where beauty contests even take place.

Yupp. But as i&#39;m from Finland Russia seems also so weird and not safe country to me. But ofc i can be wrong. What kind of security for patients you have in there? If there&#39;s something to make you safe then i&#39;ll say OP go ahead but if not, i&#39;d not to go.  Op you do you

I&#39;m italian and I&#39;m concerned. You mentioned having already your passport changed, I think going stealth is your best option. You have to consider how you get your visa, I would personally use more vague terms like &#34;cosmetic surgery&#34; as motivation.

Girl I’m not saying I’m going lol, I’ve already almost booked w another surgeon, I’m just doing my research and I had to share cause I’m amazed. For the eventual trip, I’m already living as stealth so it’s not a problem, never had a problem in any airport luckily for me. Comunque di dove sei? Piacere di conoscerti!

I have had SRS with Dr.Taskov and I am a very happy patient. I think he is very competent doctor, I have no idea why it is difficult to find any information about him on reddit or else where. He has a huge experience   (15years or more) and he is not just a “plastic surgeon”. Tho yes, he is a chef of the department “aesthetic and plastic medicine” in a public hospital. Idk maybe because it’s a public hospital they have troubles with marketing - but also I think they have more than enough ppl who need help so there are no need for marketing. So he performs all kind of different surgeries which include (from what i know and i don’t have medical education) skin cancer, burns, all kinds of accidents, reconstruction of breast after breast cancer, I have even heard about reconstruction of feet, and yes also it includes a lot of transsexual patients (BA,ffs,SRS). I think 1-2 SRS MtF per week as minimum. Also what I want to say, that if you do your surgery in Germany at least with Dr. Taskov I think it is a part of a deal that you will have to stay in the Hospital for 2-3 weeks and he and his medical team will take a good and professional care of you. He once came to visit me (and other patients) on Saturday and after he came again on Sunday! Where ever you go - good luck with it🙂

For anyone reading this now, Dr Sluzky now operates in Yerevan - Armenia and Georgia so no need to travel to Russia.

Yeah Russia is a bad idea. Trans people are considered scum there, and can&#39;t even get a drivers license due to being considered utterly insane. Where do you think Trump got his anti trans ideas?

yes, every opinion you don&#39;t like must come from a russian shill

(btw, because you&#39;re probably speaking of that comment: the US military budget is more than 11 times larger than the russian military budget, and therfore russia not a realistic threat to anyone anymore

Where did you find results for Dr. Taskov? There is not much Info to be found bc. german surgeons arent allowed to &#34;advertise&#34; with surgery results. I´d be really interested in seeing what he can do and what it would cost.

Go see Taskov. I saw good work by him in a recent patient. He has no records of deaths, botched or coma like butcher Bart. He seems to know facial balance and better aesthetics than Bart. Amy Summers from the FFS group hates him to the bone cause she said he is a plastic surgeon doing FFS and shouldn&#39;t. She is so angry towards him despite not being a patient of him. It&#39;s odd but yeah dig deeper.

You have to be in the FFS group on Facebook. You have to join to see it. Amy Summers is German and a patient of Bart. She went batshit crazy and super rude on the woman that had a really good result from her surgery with Tascov. I could not understand her intense disapproval. I thought he operated on her before and was unhappy but nope. It was just super weird.

It&#39;s also in english. She operates from in Yerevan and Georgia so no need to travel to Russia. Her prices are just crazy good considering the quality of work she does. I&#39;m seriously considering going to her.
