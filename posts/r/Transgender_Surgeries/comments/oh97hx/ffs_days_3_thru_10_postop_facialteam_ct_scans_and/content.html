Thanks so much for these detailed posts, I&#39;ve just got my stitches out at FT yesterday (must have passed like ships in the night with me going in for surgery as you were leaving tho!)
</p>
<p>
I followed your posts closely going in as we have had really similar procedures done, I found them really helpful.
</p>
<p>
Just one thing occurs to me, I asked repeatedly if my skull would be weaker than before the op ( I like my adventure sports and didn&#39;t want to risk it being weaker ) and they assured me that after the 6-8 week healing window it would just as strong as before the surgery. Just found your post clashed with that take from the surgeons, maybe you had more aggressive forehead work done tho?

Aaa honestly I feel great, I look amazing already and just feel really lucky to have been able to afford to go to facialteam and be recovering as well as I have!
</p>
<p>
The only issue right now is the totally numb scalp (with random tingling and itching) which I&#39;ve been told will get better over the first year. Also I&#39;m expecting some hair loss, but again that&#39;s temporary.
</p>
<p>
Ahhh that makes sense, luckily I&#39;m not a boxer lol and I will definitely be taking their advise on no contact sports for the first 4 months!!

May I ask about your chin?
</p>
<p>
Did you have a cleft chin before the surgery? Was it removed?
</p>
<p>
Howre the results so far? I imagine super swollen
</p>
<p>
also AAA I wasnt expecting the last pics lol, I was wondering &#34;huh why is this NSFW?&#34;

It was a cleft chin but not usually visible. It was removed.
</p>
<p>
Swelling is way less than you&#39;d expect! I&#39;d describe it as mild to moderate, mostly around my jaw and Chin at this point
</p>
<p>
The results look great, brusing is all gone.
</p>
<p>
And lol yeah sorry I tried to warn!

Of course of course. Chin is one of the most common areas that gets addressed in these surgeries so I&#39;m sure they will!
</p>
<p>
I mean mine was kinda crazy before with it&#39;s 3 pointed shape like that, but now it&#39;s nice and rounded.

I hope it&#39;s cool to ask, but why did they put that whole mesh in one of the upper sides?

No worries! I explained it in the super walls of text but basically the bone had to be reduced too much to be ideal and there was a risk of resorbtion which is where the bone heals itself differently and visible changes can occur basically like a soft spot or a dent in the head. The mesh prevents that.
</p>
<p>
It won&#39;t ever be visible to anyone thru the skin so it&#39;s a great solution to the problem

Whoops I mirrored the first pic because I put them in the wrong order without realizing it would put the mesh on the wrong side. Oh well, I think it&#39;s obvious enough from all the other photos
