I wanna update this post b/c it’s gotten a lot of traction and I’m really grateful, I posted once before with the doctor’s names and for whatever reason nobody saw it. I had a ffs consultation with Dr.Nance Yuan and Murtaza Rizvi Huntington Beach Plastic Surgery Pasadena California. I’m not saying anything bad about them I liked my consultation with them a lot, i just think it’s weird to not have any before and after pics. I’m just now beginning to research so I want to know if anyone used them or has a referral ffs doctors who take La care insurance. I have LA care and they will completely cover my ffs and body contouring so I definitely want to use my insurance. I’m interested in referrals and if anyone has used them

It’s risky as you can’t evaluate their work and chances are the surgeon has very little experience. There’s some really bad surgeons around as well, so you can’t just blindly trust them.

Reddit has by far the most trans surgery info on internet. There’s some hidden away on Facebook, but the rest is sparse. Realself is dangerously biased.

I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable at all.  Your face is going to be the first thing people are going to see the rest of your life. Take the necessary time to find the best that you can afford that has proficient experience.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the process of evaluating surgeons and met with the first one on Monday. I liked all that he said but there was something amissed with the b/a pics of his other clients that is giving me a lot of concern. I have two more scheduled in March.

So glad I found your thread. As I was reading it I had to ponder whether I had written it myself and forgotten about it. These are my concerns exactly. I had a consultation with him and asked specifically about before and after photos and he told me he had none. Really NONE? Very odd. Also I talked to Dr. Nance Yuan and she was honest that she had not done any FFS since being out of school. She also had no before and afters to share because she had not actually done one yet. Rizvi has done many FFS surgeries, but apparently never took a photo of any results. I just got my approval for Rizvi, but Im going to see if I can talk to him about this again. Was there any update to this? Did you just decide not to do it?  Thanks

Hey, sorry for the late reply. I&#39;m bad at using this site. I went with Doctor Mittermiller. It was similar conditions where he didn&#39;t have pictures. Patients don&#39;t always sign releases and also if the doctor works with a different clinic the new clinic doesn&#39;t get rights to the pictures.  I went with Mittermiller because I liked him after meeting him. I was afraid it would take too long to get LA care to approve the referral. I&#39;m really happy with results, at the time when I got my surgery he was accepting LA care but now he&#39;s with a different clinic and they&#39;re not accepting la care yet.  It&#39;s scary making a decision without knowing what you&#39;re going to look like, I hope you figure it out. I have heard of Rizvi, he was one of the recs that my primary gave me. I think people on here have used him too, I would ask questions and be honest with him about what you want. The more you&#39;re able to communicate your goals the better your doctor can help you. Some of the things I asked: how many people have you done ffs for? Have you ever made a mistake that couldn&#39;t be fixed? Good luck, message me if you have more questions

Thank you so much for sharing. I&#39;ve had the worst communication with Rizvi&#39;s office. I think I&#39;m going to try another doctor. So glad youre happy with your results =)

A surgeon without experience should be apprenticing under a good surgeon, where they can safely build up a portfolio of results.

A surgeon without before and after...  Ain&#39;t going near my face or vagina.  No way.

I wouldn’t necessarily trust pictures they show you anyway, since they can just show you the best outcomes. I would search for pictures on this sub. But if you can’t find any pictures anywhere I wouldn’t do it.

Don&#39;t do that.
</p>
<p>
Always look at before and afters, ask exactly how things are done, what methods they use, what technologies they use for planning, imaging, what they&#39;d do in case of complications or undesired outcomes, etc.

I would VERY MUCH like to establish some contact with you. As it happens, I FINALLY got my list of surgeons from my primary (gender transition) clinic people. One of the names on this list is Dr. Yuan...and--so far--I&#39;m feeling very good about things (including my communication with her Office Manager (and I&#39;ve heard that the &#34;waiting time&#34; for a procedure may be MUCH less than with most other surgeons!!), but she seems that (as you&#39;ve found) that she has very little in the way of &#34;before and after&#34; photos, which concerns me. Other cosmetic surgeons have as many as DOZENS of photos (and often along with patient feedback).

I think their lack of photos is also because this is coming through insurance and not treated as a &#39;cosmetic&#39; procedure. If it were, you would have all the before and after photos you would expect from a cosmetic surgeon. But can you imagine breaking your arm and asking your doctor for before and after photos of his previous work? Or any other medically necessary surgery for that matter? You might look at reviews, but you don&#39;t get any photos or the like from your doctor. FFS or any gender affirming surgery, especially through state insurance, I imagine, would be treated the same way. Trans people are asking that it be treated as &#39;medically necessary&#39; surgery, and yet it&#39;s our faces so we want before and afters like a cosmetic procedure.  And I&#39;m the one who wants before and afters on state insurance lol

No. I&#39;m a bit of a risk taker and have done some crazy shit in my life, I have a ton of tattoos and piercings and have traveled to crazy dangerous places without much concern... But just flat out no I would never do that. It&#39;s a total roll of the dice without picture proof of his work... AND IT&#39;S YOUR FACE 😢
</p>
<p>
What style of ffs does he do natural or Hollywood doll? Has he actually done ffs or just cosmetic surgery? Do people actually look good after? Hard to say without knowing way more abt the doc and seeing results. There are horror stories where albeit rare, people have disfigurement and pain for many years after or indefinitely. I would not take that risk.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d fly to Thailand and pay out of pocket before I would risk a doc with no before and after pics. I don&#39;t care who the doc says he is trying to protect by not keeping before and afters. I&#39;m confident a large portion of trans women would allow a doc to take before and after photos to show other trans women who come in. I don&#39;t trust any doc who doesn&#39;t have at least a few results photos. And even if he did, if there are no results on Reddit or Susan&#39;s or anywhere else online, hell nah. Smells like a bad idea to me.

OK, so for FFS a specialist is better. That long list of surgeries would alarm me. Ask how many FFS they have done and what procedures.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to Dr Deschamps-Brally for example, he does facial surgery and that&#39;s it, he&#39;s fully qualified in that and does big operations for it 3 times a week, every week. He gets good results due to skill but also due to lots of experience, he started out with a mentor and you can guarantee he needed guidance in the early days. With the surgeon you listed in comparison I would be deeply concerned that they would not have that necessary experience.
</p>
<p>
An odd job person is great for fixing a blocked sink but I wouldn&#39;t want them operating on my face....
