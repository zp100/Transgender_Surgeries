I&#39;ve had bottom surgery with Dr. Schöll in late May of this year and wanted to share my results. In the years before deciding on a surgeon, I was always annoyed that there weren&#39;t that many surgery results available online, so I swore to post my experience on reddit once I&#39;m done. With a new account for privacy reasons.
</p>
<p>
Even if there turned out to be some aesthetic complications that at times looked pretty nasty. Three months later seems like a good cutoff to share the progress so far, so here we go!

<p>
The first decent picture I could take is from 6 days after surgery, still at the hospital. I was actually quite happy with it. You still see the sutures and everything, but other than that, it looked promising. But you may already notice the black part on the left labia that would become a little problem soon enough...
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The second picture is taken from the day of the release from the hospital, 16 days after the surgery. The black part is a wound healing disorder that had unfortunately become more present by then. It was, the doctors reassured me, not as urgent as it looked, and would get better over time. And in a way, it did. But first, it got more...yellow.
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
24 days after the surgery, it looked pretty...rough. Bloody, yellow, black...it reminded me a bit of the pictures they put on cigarette packs to scare off people. But hey, it&#39;s a long recovery, right? I asked Morath &amp; Schöll&#39;s office for advice and got an appointment a few days later to remove the yellow and black part, which was quick and painless. Again, I was reassured that it wasn&#39;t anything dangerous.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Another 34 days later, things were looking a lot better. Almost two months after surgery, the sutures were all out, and the cuts during surgery became a lot less apparent. I still had a good deal of bleeding every morning when I took out the placeholder before showering, but other than that, nothing really affected me in my day-to-day life anymore.
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, some parts turned black again a week later. I asked the doctors (Schöll and La Regina, one of the surgeons at the hospital) again, but it seems to be an issue with scar discoloration. They did not see anything that needs to be fixed and just recommended waiting. And well, after waiting almost another month...
</p>
<h1>
How it looks now
</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/qzk6atl3bskd1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e654ad952b9fed2b3b24b52d67d59cb44b10549">93 days post-op
</a>
</p>
<p>
This is how it looks now, 93 days after the surgery. The darker parts are still there, even bigger now. But their appearance changes over the day, they are dry and there don&#39;t seem to be any other issues, so I&#39;ll keep waiting (I had actually asked once more at the office of the surgeons to be sure, and it seems to just be a part of the healing process). Aside from the darker parts, I&#39;m mostly okay with the aesthetics so far. But mostly because my understanding is that the second surgery (probably sometime in early 2025 for me) will be used to address aesthetic issues. The infamous dog ears will definitely be treated then, so I don&#39;t care about them too much. But...
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/z25qocw5bskd1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a65398456050bb21bb9186f61cd5242ce763368">93 days post-op, spread
</a>
</p>
<p>
The clit (or at least one half of it) is sticking out quite a bit and I wish the labia would cover that, but I had already discussed with Dr. Schöll that we&#39;ll address that in the revision. Now, about that other noticeable thing...
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/5cuo9j1dbskd1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f024e756dfd0d74543dfdc4f285a134b92904e7c">92 days post-op, half-closed

</a>
</p>
<p>
Apart from the clit and the discoloration, the labia minora ending a too early on the left side in the pictures is probably my main concern. I was unfortunately circumcised as a kid, which was confirmed to me to be the cause of this. Which is a bit unfortunate, as I had brought that up pre-op, but it wasn&#39;t deemed an issue. I brought up maybe doing a skin graft for that in the revision, but the response was rather negative. I&#39;ll wait for now, but having a gap about as wide as my pinky when my legs are closed isn&#39;t ideal and I&#39;d prefer it to be closed then. I think Lauren_boo9 had a similar issue in her surgery thread. Maybe it gets better when the bulbus is pushed back(?) in the second surgery, but we&#39;ll see.

I do like how it looks when I&#39;m standing. That would probably be enough to not get any weird looks in a sauna, gym locker and the like. I can even...

<p>
...do a cameltoe. Which is something I had been looking forward to in the years before the surgery, to be honest. It&#39;s a minor thing, but it&#39;s pretty validating. Though it also highlights the asymmetry a bit. But if someone saw me in underwear, they wouldn&#39;t suspect anything, so that&#39;s good.
</p>
<h1>
Am I happy with the results?
</h1>
<p>
I had three major areas of concern before the surgery, so I&#39;ll split that answer into three parts as well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Aesthetics: It&#39;s a bit below my expectations when comparing it to some other pics here and on Discord servers that were also taken after 3 months of recovery max. Especially since the consensus seems to be that Morath &amp; Schöll were the best around here for aesthetics. I even liked the look of two moonths post-op more than now. But I also understand that bottom surgery is complicated, healing is a long and very individual process and there&#39;s still the second part of the surgery coming up. And, if needed, more revisions after that. So let&#39;s put it at &#34;wait and see&#34;.
</li>
<li>
Sensitivity: I&#39;m not really numb anymore, so the nerves seem fine. Sexual activity is still a work in progress. I didn&#39;t have a partner before the surgery and I won&#39;t be looking for one until everything&#39;s healed. But I tried some masturbation here and there once the pain was gone. I haven&#39;t had any orgasms yet, but other than that, it&#39;s been pretty enjoyable. I don&#39;t really get anything out of clitoral stuff (neither did I before surgery), but penetration with my fingers or toys feels great. Some positions and acts seem to get me close, but not quite there. I guess it&#39;s comparable to edging so far. I&#39;d love to try that with a partner at some point. It&#39;s a shame they apparently didn&#39;t use the frenulum, as that used to be my most sensitive part.
</li>
<li>
Everyday issues: when I&#39;m not naked, I mostly don&#39;t really notice anything from the surgery. There are still some minor pains here and there, but nothing that stops me from my everyday activities. My body is still a bit exhausted and just lying around for most of the time doesn&#39;t exactly help with staying in shape. But working from home is no issue and going out for a few hours (for shopping or to the office) works as well. Urinating is also no problem, although I feel like my bladder has gotten a bit weaker. Maybe that&#39;s just the placeholder, though. Having to dilate three times a day is a bit cumbersome, so I don&#39;t have a lot of free time on workdays. Dr. Schöll mentioned again that doing it 3x daily for 6 months will be enough for the rest of your life, so that&#39;s my schedule. And so far, it worked out.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Depth is 11-12.5 cm, which is enough for me. It changes a bit from day to day and increases slightly with more preparation. I think I started with 13 cm, so I lost a bit. But depth wasn&#39;t that important to me to begin with, and when the surgeons asked me whether I wanted more depth at the cost of a higher risk of complications, I declined.
</p>
<p>
As for self-lubrication...no, not really. Completely dry most of the time and I definitely need lube to insert anything.
</p>
<h1>
Would I do it again?
</h1>
<p>
I probably felt the best I&#39;ve ever felt in the ~2 months after surgery, so it was definitely the right decision to get bottom surgery. I don&#39;t miss my old parts at all and I&#39;ve already mostly forgotten how it looked before.
</p>
<p>
Everyone at the office of Morath &amp; Schöll was really nice and easily reachable before and after the surgery, so that&#39;s definitely a plus. Same goes for the people working at the Rotkreuzklinikum where I had the actual surgery. Two other surgeons there (Dr. Fiechtner and Dr. La Regina) were also great to be around. Another surgeon (male, but his name escapes me) was a bit...weird from how he handled my room mates at the hospital, but I didn&#39;t deal with him directly. Apart from one or two nurses, the rest of the staff was also really kind and handled everything trans-related really well.
</p>
<p>
Still, I can&#39;t help but wonder how it would have turned out with another surgeon...
</p>
<p>
Markovsky was another option on my list. I had talked to him once or twice and he made a good impression. But I talked to others on his team as well. One seemed a bit absent-minded yet nice. I had an appointment with yet another doctor of the team for an unrelated urological issue, which went really bad and made me worry about how they&#39;d treat aftercare issues, so I decided against it. Other experiences here seem to be really good, but it didn&#39;t really feel right for me.
</p>
<p>
I also had an appointment with Liedl and joined their waiting list. Technically, I&#39;m probably
<em>
still
</em>
on it, but I haven&#39;t heard from them in 1.5 years. So either they forgot me or their waiting list is huge. A friend of mine had surgery there and had a pretty unpleasant (yet eventually worthwhile) experience, though, so I&#39;m not sure if I would have gone there.
</p>
<h1>
What&#39;s next?
</h1>
<p>
I have another checkup with Dr. Schöll in two months to discuss the revision and a breast augmentation that I&#39;ll probably do in the same surgery, but likely not before 2025. Breast augmentation still needs to be approved by my insurance, and I&#39;ll likely get FFS in November first.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m planning to do an update post in the future, at least one after the revision. Maybe one before as well, but we&#39;ll see. If you have any questions, fire away!

They didn&#39;t say any specific name, actually. Just that it&#39;s a
<em>
Wundheilungsstörung
</em>
, which directly translates to wound healing disorder. But it&#39;s due to lower-than-ideal blood flow.

Wow, this is a great lesson in patience and the healing powers of time. You healed up very nicely. I personally think your aesthetics are good, but I understand if they don&#39;t meet your needs entirely. Necrosis is very scary and hard to deal with, so im sorry you went through tissue loss like that. It&#39;s just really incredible to see the pictures of you at your &#39;worst&#39; stages of healing, to then see everything closed up nicely. You&#39;ve been through a lot but I hope it&#39;s fairly smooth sailing from here!
