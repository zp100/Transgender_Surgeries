Despite being blacklisted virtually everywhere from clinics to conventions, Kathy Rumer is still roping in new victims via google. Rumer and her staff have been making sock accounts and posting reviews posing as patients.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who are unfamiliar with Dr. Rumer&#39;s colorful history I have included her list of atrocities against the trans community at the bottom of this post.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The following tropes can be identified in all of Dr. Rumer&#39;s fake reviews.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
1.) &#34;
<em>
My patient coordinator
</em>
&#34; usually followed by &#34;
<em>
answered all of my questions
</em>
&#34; or a story that is so outlandish that it gives the patient coordinator an insane amount of praise. &#34;IE:
<em>
My patient coordinator is so awesome that they saved the Earth from the asteroid and invited me to the Rumer family dinner!
</em>
&#34; In addition the patient coordinator is almost always name dropped. The &#34;hero&#39;s of humanity&#34; include, Gina, Terry, Jen and Dawn.
</p>
<p>
2.) Nurses/Staff at &#34;X&#34; Hospital. Currently its Taylor hospital, older reviews showed past hospitals.
</p>
<p>
3.) First time google reviewer. Sometimes though they will have 2 other reviews in random locations all over PA or Jersey.
</p>
<p>
4.) &#34;Would recommend&#34; Usually comes at the end.
</p>
<p>

Here are some more glaring examples through out google, yelp, and various medical websites

For those of you who are just learning about Kathy Rumer from this post....
</h1>
<h1>
And for those who already know, you are encouraged to copy and paste this list, it yields results everywhere. Remember folks, every time you save a patient from going to Dr. Rumer an angel gets their wings.
</h1>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Kathy Rumer’s atrocities and disregard for the safety and well being of her patients include but are not limited to:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Rumer’s staff ignore the patient&#39;s chart, prescribe medication which could be fatal to the patient:

</p>
<p>
Rumer botches FTM patient, Rumer’s staff frequently misgendered the patient:

Rumer denies patient surgical follow up care because of negative review (transcript at bottom of page):

Rumer ghosts patient after major complication, later instructs patient to cut off dangling labia with scissors:

</p>
<p>
Dr. Rumer attempts to silence two of her low income trans patients through a SLAPP suit. Rumer used a right-wing affiliated transphobic legal team and brought the case before an anti-LGBTQ Trump appointed judge:

</p>
<p>
Rumer casually admits to going through patients&#39; medical records in order to witch hunt her detractors and labels her own patients as “transphobic trolls.”:

ahhh
<br>
you made a mistake, investigated, discovered your mistake and followed up with stakeholders to correct the misinformation.
</p>
<p>
on top of that you politely apologized,
<strong>
AND
</strong>
you even edited your original post (the first thing people see when looking) to highlight this mistake along with providing the
<em>
correct
</em>
information
</p>
<p>
you realize you&#39;re 😎 awesome and just did exactly what we all wish doctors would do? you set a great example...
</p>
<p>
in a way, one could say, you&#39;re behaving better than a doctor.
</p>
<p>
thank you!!

Because if the system and WPATH actually held her accountable, it would end ALL GCS surgeries for everyone. This is why direct action is needed. If the system wont hold her accountable then we will make damn sure she never gets another patient again until she goes bankrupt.

Ok so I read the whole article, and looked for anywhere that it said WPATH wouldn’t be able to hold her accountable, and all I can see is that because they don’t have an official certification for trans-related surgeries, they can’t remove that from her.
</p>
<p>
HOWEVER, I’m pretty fucking sure that regardless of the type of surgery, ignoring patients’ infections and cancelling follow-up appointments does not constitute the WPATH-recommended level of care. Unless you’re implying that ALL GCS surgeons do not uphold the proper standard of care, it still seems cut and dry to me.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I’d really appreciate it if someone could explain to me why just because there isn’t a certification for trans surgeries, surgeons are being allowed to ignore life-threatening complications in writing

They won&#39;t say it openly.
</p>
<p>
Here is WPATH President Marci Bowers&#39;
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fdpri8hlebara1.jpg">performative response
</a>
when asked WHY she won&#39;t hold Rumer accountable. Dr. Rumer has been reported countless times to the medical board long before Bowers became president so this is a useless gesture.

Thank you so much! Hate to see it, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain that WPATH is literally just transphobic

I am familiar with her tactics and you are 100% correct.  And Jennifer is her linchpin rounding you up on the phone and setting up Skype meeting.  I was told by Jennifer back in April that I would have my surgery in first week of August if I had my letters and insurance approval.  Thank God they did not accept my insurance because yes like most of us I was desperate and I thought she was my only hope. I finally convinced my friend to please don&#39;t go with her, she is misleading and flat out lying to people about the #of vaginaoplasty she is doing per year which I was told 250 average with less than 1.0% revisions and what&#39;s making her so alluring is she does not require hair removal and does single pass procedure which is claiming to do labiaplasty for the hood at initial surgery.  Which is almost unheard of and especially without complications.  There&#39;s a few lawsuit against her back last spring when I finally looked into her and a couple that was settled with undisclosed details on what it was over. I read a few of no support after surgery while she was vacationing on a beach and these were not hearsay these were lawsuit. I honestly can&#39;t believe she is still in business and people do need to be warned and read up on her. The truth is out there . It&#39;s amazing how low we will stoop in desperate times,  I considered her myself I can&#39;t lie so please just ask around and Do your research and don&#39;t let the false advertising and fantasy results fool you. Girls lives like yours and mine have been ruined forever by her and it needs to be known and stopped.

I told op I don&#39;t have the article handy,  I never downloaded anything like that I just came across it on a Google search on the Dr. for negative reviews and it was from one of the girls that was taking her to court. I no her mom was a nurse and her caregiver and the best I remember she had gotten ahold of the Dr and the Dr said your a nurse can&#39;t you deal with it. This is not word for word but the story is out there and it&#39;s a pretty jaw dropping one and it&#39;s the one that showed me that I wasn&#39;t having nothing to do with Dr. Rumor.  I believe I ran across 3 different people who were trying to malpractice sue her that had pretty solid stories.  Plus I read where one had been settled for an undisclosed terms but if I recall it was for bad results on a plastic surgery procedure.  There was more than I felt like investing time reading.  Like I said I just Google it.

Omg I can&#39;t remember where it was but if was from one of the girls that was taking her to court. The girl that had the vaginaoplasty her mom was the one taking care of her and was a registered nurse and new her daughter had some abnormal things going on and there was a lot of stuff,  it wasn&#39;t too hard to find,  pretty sure it was one of them that was actually taking her to court.  Sorry I don&#39;t have a link,  I came across this just by Google search the Dr for bad reviews.

Im going to be updating this post in an hour or so when I get home. I have received more confirmed fakes. this time blatant conflict of interest violations. (Her husband left her a few openly.) I also just learned that this shit is a $250,000 dollar fine by the FTC so Im going to compile everything and then we can stage a mass reporting campaign.

Edit: just updated it.

There is a girl who went to her and posted pictures of her results. The image is jarring to look at. It’s terrifying that she is allowed to perform any surgeries. This is terrifying.
