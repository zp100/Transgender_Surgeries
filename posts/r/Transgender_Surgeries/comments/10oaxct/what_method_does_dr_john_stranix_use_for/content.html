Dr. Stranix does the peritoneal cap/flap method and aesthetics the exact same way as Rachel Bluebond-Langner (NYU Langone); who Stranix was directly trained from. He works along side Dr. Corbett who does the urological/robot part of the surgery I believe.
</p>
<p>
The method that RBL trained him is basically the PI method but with a flap added at the end for extra depth and some benefits of PPT. This method also allows for some to have more material to work with on the vulva as well.
</p>
<p>
I think because Stranix works out of a university system and is in a teaching hospital, he’s not allowed to show pictures or promote his work directly (as with NYU and OHSU for instance). Instead it is up to the patient to post their experiences on their own account.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I would be too worried, RBL trains really well theses surgeons. If you look at Dr. Jun for instance, he’s a phenomenon! So is Dr. Dy and Peters at OHSU; I’d say you are in great hands with Dr. Stranix!

I think they took about 5 hours to do my vaginoplasty. I definitely wouldn&#39;t consider that to be longer than normal or longer than other surgeons. My results were phenomenal, and I&#39;m beyond happy with the work Dr Stranix did.
