I had surgery a couple of weeks ago and so far I am regretting it. Not only because I have some complications and unwanted changes but I also can&#39;t help but think the surgeon took an aggressive approach. The surgery was on my face and cannot be reversed. I feel I am stuck in a dark place that I cannot get out of and my face is now a daily reminder of that mistake. I am still healing but hate the results already. I don&#39;t feel good about myself anymore and don&#39;t enjoy wearing make up or doing things I usually enjoy. I don&#39;t know what to do as I have contacted my local anxiety helpline but with COVID I can&#39;t see them in person and they have a 3 months waiting list. I worry about my life and future everyday and it is worst at night. Please help I&#39;m starting to think I&#39;m better off dead yet I wish this was a nightmare I could wake up from. At the moment I have discoloration on my entire upper neck weeks after the surgery and have a bump under my chin that is hard. Surgeon did not comment on the discoloration and does not know what the bump under my chin is. My lip is smaller and my smile has changed. Incisions are weird too as one has closed and the other seems like it hasn&#39;t. My face also looks weird and I now have sunken cheeks since jaw reduction. I wanna seek a second opinion but with COVID I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t know how to cope as I now have anxiety and depression and surgeon gets mad whenever I raised concerns. Please help I don&#39;t know what to do.

Update: the responsible surgeon is Bart Van de Ven. So called oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Belgium.

You’re not done healing! You will look absolutely miserable for more than a couple of weeks after any facial surgery. Eyelid/jaw surgeries are usually the worst.
</p>
<p>
The lump may also disappear. I’ve had surgeries where a cannula was used and it was just part of the healing process for one of the scars. The mark is gone now.
</p>
<p>
Recovery from cosmetic procedures is an intensely stressful time. Don’t ever forget, you’re still healing. Wait at least 6 months to start panicking, and even then, your final results may take up to a year to show

You are no where done healing. Put away the mirrors and read a book, watch movies, or anything else to get your mind off of it. Surgery is not as instant a fix as some think it is. You need to give yourself time to heal all the way. Sending you love and hugs 🤗

Sorry, but after six weeks you&#39;re far from healing therefore far from results. Go watch movies or netflix for now, it&#39;s the best thing you can do for your mental health.

I&#39;m going to say give it more time. My jaw chin and neck area took like 3 months to look better. 4+ months for swelling to go away completely. discoloration from lipo can stay for months. I know I had lipo on my thighs for face fat grafting and that shit was there for so fucking long. Honestly try giving it 6 months, if it still sucks, then look into seeing someone for a revision

The thing is it is on my face and not on my thighs. If it was somewhere hidden I would possibly be less concerned. It also distorts the shape of my face as it goes all the up to the sides of my chin where it meets the jaw...... make up is not enough to cover it and looks even more unsightly.

Yeah I didn&#39;t have any lipo around my neck so I cant entirely relate. I&#39;d give it a month or two and see if it is any better.

Fat was transferred from my inner thighs to the cheeks. They went in close to the templs for the incision points. Had no scaring from it. Filled out my cheek bones and gave me an overall round more youthful face.

This is right around the time where people who have FFS start to really worry - you
<em>
really
</em>
need to give it 6mo, and I know that&#39;s impossibly hard, but I promise,
<strong>
especially
</strong>
with chin/jaw surgery, your face will look much much different by then - people report a big change right around 5-6mo.  Even if a surgeon was willing to do something you really don&#39;t want to touch it so soon after you had your first surgery, you will only do more damage

Thank you everyone for all the kind encouragements. I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to go under the knife again as I don&#39;t want to have more surgery. However, I do think that the lipo on my upper neck was not done correctly or was rushed. And the surgeon who performed it has no idea what the hell caused this discoloration on my ENTIRE upper neck. I suspect that the changed to my lip and smile may also be on purpose. Their reassurance to me sounds like their way of making me shut up. I will again keep you guys updated here and share what a local surgeon will say and possibly ask them to write in my consultation letter the findings and what my provider has to do to help me solve this discoloration which could be PERMANENT. If it was not due to a long waiting list for my first choice of surgeon I would have done it locally even though it would be more expensive.

Remember that if you threaten legal action or any kind of &#34;collect a paper trail&#34; type of thing, they&#39;re going to immediately stop all contact and treat you as an opposing party.
</p>
<p>
If that&#39;s what you want you can do it, but you should expect that
<em>
any
</em>
surgeon is going to be extremely paranoid about malpractice lawsuits, and that from then on, getting your own lawyer is going to be basically required to get them to comply to anything, and they&#39;re not going to treat you anymore.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;re there yet. I think I&#39;d ask the surgeon: &#34;What can be done if this discoloration / bump / lipo unevenness isn&#39;t going away after N months.&#34;  If the answers are, &#34;we can do X, Y, and Z&#34;, then even if it doesn&#39;t go away you have a way to mitigate it.

I&#39;m not really planning on threatening legal action but  perhaps letting them know of what other medical professionals say after examination and if necessary  tests and scan suggest that the discoloration is not bruising and should be treated with such and such and the bump is a bone that was not shaven right or something else based on X rays etc. then requesting my provider to pay for my treatment is based on facts and medical findings. That way, the mistake can be corrected by my provider. Any denial or reluctance to help me will mean just that and is not how a patient and surgeon relationship should be.
</p>
<p>
By then it is obvious that they have chosen to damage the trust and relationship themselves, and taking legal action is an option but of course should be the last resort.

I know you&#39;re reading this as a relationship between two people, but your doctor will read &#34;Collecting formal 3rd party documentation&#34; as &#34;I am absolutely setting up to sue you&#34;. I would be
<em>
extremely
</em>
surprised if this would motivate them to help you.
</p>
<p>
If you want to try this tactic, I would frame it as, &#34;My doctor said she noticed this might be $X, what do you think? Do you think it should be treated with $Y?&#34;
</p>
<p>
<em>
(And to be perfectly, 100% clear, I&#39;m not on the doctor&#39;s side here! Doctors having to be cagey due to threat of litigation absolutely sucks - I&#39;m just trying to set you up to get the result you want without accidentally setting off a fight that you might not mean to)

If they&#39;re confident with themselves, they should not feel that way and it is my right to seek a second opinion. I am prioritising my health and sanity over theirs and to be frank, I am in a deeper shit than they are if this is indeed a permanent mess.

And by that time I would be 2-3 months post op.

You always have the right to consult with another surgeon.  Give yourself time to heal. Inflammation can take 6 month to go down. I&#39;m sorry that you are regretting your surgery, and remember it can be revised. You never want to go backwards in life, there are good reasons that you moved on.

I have no choice but to indeed heal and hope that things get better. It would be a huge relief for my sanity when this tiny bump and discoloration on my upper neck disappear. I am praying my smile returns to how they used to be and so as the shape of my lip. I have lost faith in this surgeon and I feel like their skills are russian roulette. They also seem to push boundaries that increase risks. I think any surgeon should know their limits and if they want to do more types of surgery such as plastic surgery then they should get the formal training and qualification like many others. I am somehow thankful that I sound normal when I talk and can eat normal.
</p>
<p>
I really don&#39;t want another surgery as this was supposed to be the last. I don&#39;t understand how something that&#39;s supposed to be their area of expertise be performed so poorly on me who didn&#39;t even need as much work as others. It is almost as if I was dealt with as quick as possible just for the sake of it. And changing my smile and my lip which I didn&#39;t want changed is rather unethical and coming out of it with more problems that I came for is not a positive sign.
</p>
<p>
I wanted this surgery to be a positive story and a start of a good relationship with this surgeon, but I feel like this surgeon didn&#39;t care and has no real interests in their patients.
</p>
<p>
I will consult with a top craniofacial surgeon here with plastic surgery experience and that should shed light on whether if my concerns are indeed temporary or actual complications.

Tbh...  all sounds normal. I obviously don’t know your exact situation, but I would wait at least a month to start being concerned.
</p>
<p>
For the first two weeks, my face was bruised all over. For the first month, it was bloated so much I would have wanted to die if that’s how I came out. 2-3 months later is when the scars finally were disappearing and it all was finally starting to take shape, and I’m still seeing improvements now at nearly a year later.
</p>
<p>
Bruises will come and go, things will be misshapen, but try not to lose sleep over it. A lot of us have this same freakout early on but are happier than ever when it heals.

I guess maybe you should not ask for advice from anyone again in life.   You said surgery a couple weeks ago.  You.have many people advising you that your situation is normal.   Yet you refuse to take any advice fron others with the same surgery that said the symptoms you have are normal healing.   Give it six months. Not a couple weeks.   But i guess they all uad that surgery and know nothing.   Why comment anf ask advice then refuse to take it? There are people that really need help anr appreciate others sharing their experiences.

I definitely will NOT not ask anyone again for advice in life as that is not a good advice at all. I have never said or refused to take into account what others have said. I also have no choice but to heal as what is done is done so I just have to live with it. I&#39;m already feeling very down, scared, can&#39;t sleep or feel like eating. And again, I am not discrediting what others are saying as I&#39;m very thankful for it.
</p>
<p>
I just need that reassurance from another surgeon and dermatologist that all is indeed normal based on physical examination.

It was jaw and chin and I was given lipo on my upper neck which gave me this discoloration that&#39;s no longer bruising. There&#39;s a small bump the size of a rice grain that surgeon has no clue what it is other than a possible bump caused by the friction of the cannula. But it is hard and does not feel like soft tissues.

ok with lipo discoloration usually vanishes within the first 6 weeks. any longer and it&#39;s worth talking with your surgeon. though there are rare cases where discoloration may linger for 2 to 3 months. i don&#39;t know if you may be one of those people but don&#39;t panic just yet.
</p>
<p>
i really think you should wait 3 months for the swelling to go down and for the discoloration to fade. you need time for your body to heal. also, your brain is still getting used to your new face. i was pretty depressed too after my FFS. take it easy on yourself.

It will be 6 weeks tomorrow and all the yellow bruises have gone since week 3. I feel like the surgeon I went to rushed my surgery or is playing plastic surgery as well too when he is more of an OMFS. I wonder about the others who had surgery with him and got lipo on the upper neck before I did and if they are suffering from the same issue. I often can tell early on if something is off. I think he is going beyond what he is qualified to do and is practising on patients.

Wait 3/4 months babe. That how long it takes for your body to settle in and do yoga or some stree releavers around your back and next. That will allow your head to drain and muscles relax.

Wait for it to heal, it may look extremely different when it’s fully healed. If you’re still dissatisfied, look into FFS revision with another surgeon and possibly get into contact w them if you want to in the future.

Thanks for the advice. As stated I don&#39;t really want another surgery on the jaw and chin unless it won&#39;t involve any bone cutting. My chin and jaw have been reduced already that another would leave me with no jaw and chin. My issues are functional, soft tissue and aesthetic related.
</p>
<p>
If I ever want a revision, it would be a reconstruction with jaw implants which is a massive surgery. And that is another nightmare that I don&#39;t even want to imagine going through.

Hold your horses there. You have no right to suddenly diagnose me as if you&#39;re my doctor. No one cares or asks about your degree and it doesn&#39;t give you the right to suddenly label me or anyone else. I have been living full time before I even turned 18 more likely younger than you did but it does not matter. Are you seriously accusing me now of being an effeminate male? Are you serious? Sounds like you are the one with issues here when someone disagress with you. I don&#39;t know where all of this is coming from and what&#39;s your agenda for shifting this thread to me being not trans, male and stupid? Really? You have typos all over your posts.
</p>
<p>
And with all due respect take your issue out of my thread as you obviously have your own issues to solve. Your irrational assumption is not necessary and did you even read what I wrote? I was asking for help on how I could cope which I have taken on board. Again, you posting here does not help. I ask again, what is your agenda?

No people.with that same surgery advised that individual to wait.amd let heal. Some kids come here asking advice just to ask and then.argue.with those.who actually give valid.advice. the problem is.not enough people are honest and call them on their bs.
<br>
By not calling them people become an enabler. So many fake people here work for approval instead of giving honest help which is.sometimes not popular.

Oh well. I&#39;m just honest.  Maybe you should read that thread from the beginning.   Kid asked for advice.  Valid was given and kid just wantes to argue.   Even. Sent me a private measage admitting they didn&#39;t even want advice.   So i could care less about approval or up votes.   Im brutally honest

You comment contained a number of fairly offensive statements. You should be able to help people without doing that, and if you can’t then don’t say anything. Not many trans people get banned from this sub, but you will be if you keep it up.

Yet others can advise people what to do even if it harms them?   But i cant offemd them.when i doubt their intentions. Newsflash for you cause you may be new to.the internet.  Alot of kids are trolling people here and fake. Details they give is a tell tale sign.  But i get it.  This.site.is about being fake people making things up all so they feel a sense of approval.  Have you ever looked at some people&#39;s past comments? When they are all deleted or contradict each other?   Go ahead ban this.account. i could care less.

Nobody was insulted or.degraded just some honesty.  That&#39;s whats wrong with everyone nowadays.  Too sensitive they would rather people be fake and lie rather than being honest. Which is how chats become worthless helping nobody.

If you only had surgery two weeks ago, this is completely normal and to be expected. It will clear up over time. The bump is maybe a hematoma. This will dissolve.
<br>
Everything else will resolve over time. Its not snap your fingers kind thing. :) But I will bet in 6 months you will like the results.
<br>
If not, then you can seek a second opinion.

Just an update. I have been added to the waiting list for anxiety and counselling. The bad news is that I need to wait 3 months. My issues still haven&#39;t resolved. I really wish I went with a different surgeon but it is all too late. I will update you all when I see another surgeon for a second opinion possibly once lockdown is over. I hope for the best but I fear the worst. I hope all of you are well and safe.

If that means waiting for a therapist
<a href="http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=96742367814077658293" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be a number of online gender therapists that could help. Some may have sliding scales depending on income. Additionally looking up reviews may be a good idea in case.

Yeah. Its a PDF file that is hosted without time limit there. It is also in the wiki and its a list with various therapists that have written letters for surgery. They should be aquainted with transgender issues and with surgery issues, as said additionally looking up reviews may be a good idea. And a number of them state sliding scales depending on the income of clients.

I&#39;m gonna chime in with a dissenting opinion. At 6 weeks I was swollen but I could still tell what was wrong with my results. Sure enough 6 months later those areas look worse because they&#39;re not hidden behind swelling.
</p>
<p>
So in my opinion of you come out of surgery and something seems very wrong you are probably onto something.

The thing is whenever you go for any kind of surgery. The only thing you really have to deal with are temporary swelling, bruising and pain. Anything else are likely to be a complication, unwanted changes/side effects or poor results. I have all three. Lips are fucked up, oral incisions seemed open and not fully stitched up, discolored upperneck from botched lipo, hard bump under chin and overall poor aesthetic results. That&#39;s all from jaw and chin surgery with lipo that I got from the butcher Bart Van de Ven. That&#39;s it I said it. Please do not go to this quack. I have no idea what warranted my surgery to be performed so badly. Maybe because I didn&#39;t let him butcher my ears? Or is it because he was just rushing the surgery? I have no idea. Regardless, please avoid going to him and warn others who may want to go to him.

I&#39;m sorry. No worries on me going to him, a different quack fucked me up pretty thoroughly and it will cost about as much as my original surgery to fix it. And I talked to a lawyer and no one will take my case because they won&#39;t make a ton of money off of it. I just hope everyone out there chooses wisely. If a surgeon seems pushy or like they&#39;re promising too much they probably are. Stay safe.

A lawyer refused to take your case? Why? Is it because you did not suffer lifelong consequences?
</p>
<p>
I was impressed by Bart&#39;s simulation. I thought I will look like what was shown to me or close to it. I didn&#39;t realise it was too unrealistic. So he chopped off my bones as much as possible and stopped at some point cause he realised it was too much. Now I look a lot less attractive and he ruined my skin. I am talking to a lawyer and just need to see another surgeon for a second opinion before I can file a claim.

Yes, pretty much. I was told that it costs 50k - 100k to litigate a malpractice case so there needs to be a lot more on the line than what we pay for FFS.

Don&#39;t lawyers have a no win no fee? Most lawyers here in the UK will have that and are fine with taking it to court if needed be.

No fee means they work on contingency. That means they&#39;re paying the legal fees out of their own pocket because they expect to win. They won&#39;t take any cases they&#39;re not sure they&#39;ll win.
</p>
<p>
I could just hire a lawyer and go after him myself but it would end up costing me more than revisions so there&#39;s no point.

Well I&#39;ll see what they say. They haven&#39;t said no to me so unless they tell me you don&#39;t have a case then fine. But I sure will give it a try. I just don&#39;t understand what warranted my surgery to be carried out the way it was. I was not even that demanding I just wanted to look better. And it was supossed to be his area of expertise. Wish I just had it in the UK and would have still be living happily today rather than feeling botched every waking day.

It takes a long time for ffs to settle in. My friend has it done and I didn’t have the heart to tell her she looked really weird. Saw her about 2 years later and she looked great. No additional surgeries or anything. Think about it. Your face and the skin on it had years of wear and tear. It takes awhile for a new face settle in, get some wrinkles, curves etc. I don’t want to be dismissive of your concern as I haven’t seen your face. I’m just trying to give some perspective on the possibilities. I hope it helps.

Yes I know it can take a while to settle and I can deal with that. The problem is that it is very hard to heal peacefully when you ended up with unusual changes to lip size and lower lip movement such as not pulling down when you smile, however. Add to that a discoloration on the entire upper neck that received treatment and a tiny bump under the chin that even the surgeon doesn&#39;t know what it is. To me these are tell tale signs that somewhere during the surgery, there was sloppiness and a lack of attention to detail or unnecessary aggressiveness during the liposuction on a superficial area. I am trying to be calm but it is so damn hard especially when I see it in the mirror. I get anxiety and have really fast heartbeat which also prevents me from getting enough sleep. If only my first choice of surgeon was not fully booked for months and was available for a consultation when I was less busy from work, I would have had the surgery locally.

Sweetie, how did you come to this conclusion? How many plastic surgeries have you had?   I have had several, including very extensive FFS, and a tiny bump under the chin and some persistent bruising is not unusual. You have had a dozen people who have gone through FFS tell you more or less the same thing, yet you insist on getting yourself wound up about this. It is very likely that these issues will resolve themselves.
</p>
<p>
I understand you are upset and worried but these surgeries are tough. You want to see some carnage?  Check this out:

That thread on Susan&#39;s is about my FFS with Dr. Zukowski.  I look like I got hit by a truck.  It took
<em>
months
</em>
for things to heal and I was seeing subtle changes even two years later.  Please be patient. You are more than likely going to be okay, and maybe even happy with the results.

I had 3 now in total. I just feel like my face is now too small when my face before was small already. I feel like too much was taken. I&#39;m trying so so hard to not think about it and worry. I don&#39;t feel comfortable in my own skin anymore. I miss my old face. I&#39;m glad yours turned out well though and did not touch your jaw. I probably only needed chin work but it is all too late.

After surgery we all trans and cis go into a depression. Expectations are never met with some of us. I&#39;ve had surgery and was moody. My wife has had facial surgeries a couple of times. Even after bruising, discoloration, abnormal or distended skin. Even a hard nodule by her ear. All were gone in 6 months. But it&#39;s a process, but definitely get a second opinion and remember revisions are also a thing.❤❤

First off, you would not be better off dead.  There are people who love you and care about you.  This is a tough journey and there will be better days ahead.
</p>
<p>
I remember being pretty darn miserable following my first FFS.  In fact the day after was one of the lowest points in my life.  After I got out of the hospital I stayed in a Boston hotel for a week.  I remember the first 3 days were excruciatingly painful and just awful.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t want radical surgery rather just enough to pass without makeup.  A few weeks after the bandages came off, I was questioning whether it was enough.  I remember being depressed.  I just figured that if I had to go back in a year then I would do that.  In the meantime I did the best I could.  The doctors will tell you it takes a year for all things to heal and settle in, yet after a few months, in my experience, things didn&#39;t change that much.
</p>
<p>
It would be really great if there was a foolproof system for feminization, but there isn&#39;t.  Rather, we each have the daunting task of deciding what to do and then finding doctors who have the skill and experience to effectuate the desired outcome.  There are many variables but the biggest being age and the unique features that each of us are born with.
</p>
<p>
Some trans women are just beautiful without any surgery, yet most have some masculine feature or features that would be nice to get rid of.  So even though most of us want to be pretty and passable, the hard reality is that it doesn&#39;t always work out that way.
</p>
<p>
I tend to block things into a one year time frame.  After my first FFS, I just hunkered down, did the best I could, got my mind off of it through other activities, and re-evaluated things a year later.  I did have some additional work that helped, but it is a financial drain and a time suck.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t really like to give advice because everyone is different, yet I suggest you document your concerns and provide that to your doctor.  Then you have to wait.  Once it has been a few months and the Covid thing is over, go get a second opinion.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes - stay strong.

Just FYI, my face took about 4-6 months for me to stop feeling I’d been botched... your face rn looks nothing like what it will do in the future - trust me! I went to him too btw :)

I didn’t mean to come across that way, that was insensitive. Was just trying to say that gauging your results now is pointless. I’m not botched but the swelling sure did make it look that way for a good few months - I swell super bad. Good luck with it, hope it heals well!

Do you want give update on your recovery @Federal-Tension?
</p>
<p>
Many people advices on wait 6month to see the result. How is life for you today?
</p>
<p>
Have you got consulting advice from other surgeons? If so, do you have plan to do eventual revision?
</p>
<p>
