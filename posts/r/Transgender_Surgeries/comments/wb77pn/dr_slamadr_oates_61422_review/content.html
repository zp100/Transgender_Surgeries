<p>
My surgery was done in Boston, at Boston Medical Center on June 14th, 2022
</p>
<p>
I was intact prior to surgery. I did not have an orchie prior, was circumcised. The latter did not handicap the creation of my clitoral hood. PI vaginaplasty.
</p>
<p>
I hesitate to post pictures because everytime I do, I get a bunch of creepy cis dudes in my DM’s.
</p>
<p>
From consult to surgery:
</p>
<p>
My timeline was pretty fucked because I had a consult prior to Covid with a very specific time of year I needed my surgery done in (summer. I’m a full time middle school teacher).  Then BMC shut down for a LONG time during Covid. After they reopened, I was given a date. All in all, with Covid, about 2.5 years. Would have been about 1.5 years without Covid fucking everything up.
</p>
<p>
I chose Boston for a few reasons. I went to consultations all over the country and while I liked a few of the surgeons - some seemed less enthusiastic and didn’t pass the vibe check - if you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
I asked Dr. Daddy…I mean Slama, why he did this surgery for trans people. And any surgery for trans people in general.
</p>
<p>
“Who says you don’t deserve it?”
</p>
<p>
Bingo. Correct answer.
</p>
<p>
I’m an educator and very focused on “knowing things” to know them. Dr. Slama and his team were fucking brilliant at this - every single question I asked was answered and explained at length. The same with Dr. Oates (urologist who finagled my urethra during surgery). I was told they had an “elevated” PI technique and that when I was done, it would be “perfect”. They were not joking. Anyway.
</p>
<p>
The nurse liaison is a woman by the name of Pamela Klein. She is an absolute gods-send.
</p>
<p>
6/13:
</p>
<p>
Bowel prep. Fuck me this was stupid and I apologize to the hotel for ruining their sheets overnight (sorry). I agreed to do this after being told that due to the close proximity of the surgery to the rectum, that this was simply a precaution - as they’ve never hit the rectum during surgery since beginning to do vaginaplasty.
</p>
<p>
It was terrible and my metabolism is so fast that I started going to the bathroom within the first 45 minutes.
</p>
<p>
6/14: fucking surgery day, yo!
</p>
<p>
Pre-Op check in was fine. During the “who should we call when you wake up” part of the check in - caused a minor disagreement between me and the intake nurse. I practice ethical non-monogamy and my two partners were tag teaming my aftercare. I asked for them to call both my partners after surgery. They refused and said “we won’t do that. Only 1 person”. Luckily we (the three of us, plus a friend were in a group chat together for aftercare purposes). I know if I would have asked Dr. Slama personally, that he would have.
</p>
<p>
I was brought in to a pre op room. I opted for an epidural prior to surgery. Receiving the epidural was painless. They have you sit on the side of the bed, and have you lean over a food tray table. I was given some kind of relaxant prior - but I don’t remember the name of it. The poke was painless, all I felt was like a minor tingling jolt that ran down my right side immediately after.
</p>
<p>
6/14-17: hospital stay
</p>
<p>
I was wheeled into my actual room at about 7 pm. My surgery was just a smidge under 6 hours. I was in 0 pain, and was up texting the group while one of my partners had waited for me to get out of surgery.
</p>
<p>
Transition was a little bit of a shit show. I was brought upstairs during a shift change and this caused a little snafu with being checked on once in the room. My partner stayed past visiting hours because she refused to leave until I was actually seen and assessed in my hospital room.
</p>
<p>
I was hungry - and the nurses were surprised and asked if I was sure. Fuck yes. Give me that terrible hospital food. I got a couple pudding cups and two Turkey sandwiches. And was asking for more.
</p>
<p>
0 pain. Was feeling wonderful.
</p>
<p>
My first nurse was a woman by the name of Brittany who played for team GAY. perfect. We joked around and she brought me a pride flag and a rainbow lei - and proclaimed that having GCS during Pride Month meant that I had indeed, won Pride Month. I agreed.
</p>
<p>
Other nurses were fine - however, I got the feeling that many of them had little experience with vaginaplasty patients - even though a few of them protested otherwise. I’ll get more to this in a minute. (See comments on post)
</p>
<p>
6/20: post op 1.
</p>
<p>
Vaginal packing was taken out. I could feel it. I had A LOT of feeling. The catheter came out - which was the single most painful thing I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. Pam would later tell me that it was probably because I had an unusual amount of feeling after surgery and that most women don’t feel it as much as I had. I wanted to vomit. Pain was at least, a 12/10.
</p>
<p>
I was taught how to dilate. Cool. 4 dots off the bat. 5 dots now.
</p>
<p>
6/27: post op 2.
</p>
<p>
No infections. All normal healing. No dehiss, no stitch splits, just boring ole healing. Vagina looking like a two week old vagina. I told Daddy (Dr. Slama) that I loved it and thanked him profusely.
</p>
<p>
He jokingly said “I’m glad you’re happy because it still looks terrible! Just wait 6 weeks - you won’t even remember it looking like this!”
</p>
<p>
My majora are beautiful, my minora maybe more so, my clit and hood all look wonderful. Urethra looks good and healthy. I pee a little to the left currently because I surmise that the swelling in my right minora probably has something to do with it. Unconcerned.
</p>
<p>
6/27-7/27: all aboard the gravy train! (Choo Choo)
</p>
<p>
This last month has been fucking magic. Honestly. I got cleared to go to the beach and to go in the ocean and for the last two weeks - that’s what I’ve been doing - going to go play in the waves every Friday.
</p>
<p>
I started driving short distances at 2 weeks, and can now drive the 90 minutes or so to the beach, easily.
</p>
<p>
My headspace is fantastic. Nothing but bliss and euphoria every day. I can’t remember a time when I have felt this good consistently.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is boring and painless. 5 dots on the first three dilators,  but hitting a wall at dot 4 on the last dilator. I’m hoping pelvic floor therapy helps with this.
</p>
<p>
I have about 6.1 inches of depth after measuring myself after dilation.  Coolio. I’m definitely getting a little wet when aroused - but haven’t really tried too much to cum since I have a dissolvable stitch in an inconvenient place. It’s pokey.
</p>
<p>
This is really long, and I’ve left some stuff out. But. I couldn’t be happier. If you’re considering surgery in the Northeast, and Boston is an option for you, I highly highly recommend.
</p>
<p>
10/10. Would get reassembled again. (But not really because I really like my pussy)
</p>
<p>
Also, more than happy to answer any questions.

My only complication ever:
</p>
<p>
I was bleeding. Like. Actively bleeding. Pretty badly. I must have started bleeding on Tuesday night. The night of my surgery. I was soaking my bandages and “chuck” pads every two hours. At first they were worried that it was arterial, but then were able to ascertain that it was veinous, but that it still needed to get under control because it was abnormal.
</p>
<p>
Plastics and Urology were in my room constantly - so I knew it wasn’t good. Reading my post op notes after the fact - all the nurses were worried - and talked about my bleeding with eachother at length. They notified everyone and anyone.
</p>
<p>
One very nice Plastics assistant (resident maybe?) kept trying to help my bleeding but told me that he “didn’t know much about these surgeries”. This made me a little uneasy, and it forced me to ask the nurses who were tasked with my care whether or not they knew about this procedure. He was very nice though, and I’m incredibly appreciative of his demeanor and absolute willingness to try to help. I asked where the bleeding was - and once he told me - I explained to him what part of me was used hoping that the information would help in terms of where veins were, and where the blood supply was coming from. I asked him to be honest with me about how worried we were about this bleeding and he said “more than a little. I’m sorry”.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad he told me.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Slama and Dr. Oates came to see me and told me that this kind of thing has never happened - they’ve never seen it. They then told me that if we couldn’t get it to stop - that I’d have to be brought back in - once again, something that they’ve never had to do. Dr. Slama took the blood clot off of my clit to see where the bleeding was coming from. They cleaned me, gauzed me, and then gave me a weighted like sand bag and instructed me to keep it on my pubis until further notice. I continued to bleed through Wednesday. I was put on fasting Wednesday afternoon incase I needed to go back to the OR.
</p>
<p>
At this point I was texting my group chat of partners and care givers to inform them that I had some bleeding and may need surgery again. I downplayed it but part of me thought that maybe I was in a lot of trouble.
</p>
<p>
Sometime during the night on Wednesday, my bleeding stopped. Once again, Dr. Oates and Dr. Slama came in and Dr. Oates was noticeably relieved that the bleeding had stopped and I was told if everything was okay on Thursday morning, that I could eat and would not need surgery. I learned after the fact, from my post op notes - that my Hemoglobin got down to 8, and my Crit was 21. They transfuse you at a hemoglobin of 7

UPDATE:
</p>
<p>
8/1/22: first orgasm
</p>
<p>
The Big O with a vibrator on my clit. Massive orgasm, pretty much a squirter - which is kinda awesome but messy (LOL).
</p>
<p>
8/11/22: Post Op 3.
</p>
<p>
This was 8 weeks, I was treated with a very small amount of silver nitrate because I had two “minuscule” spots of hyper granulation tissue on my right vaginal wall, and all the way at the end of my canal.
</p>
<p>
I was also cleared to have penetrative sex. FUCK. YES.
</p>
<p>
the aftermath of the silver nitrate was a bit uncomfortable - like a weird ache/burning sensation? It’s hard to action describe. My pads were pretty goopy with a mix of mucus and pieces of the hyper granulation tissue for about a week maybe?
</p>
<p>
everything since being cleared for sex has been uneventful. Sex feels good - penetration feels good. I’ve noticed that 5 dots on the dilator equals around 6”, but my girlfriends strap on is 6.5” and it was a non issue. I’m sure this is probably due to the nature of the dildo in terms of malleability.

Congrats hun!  Thank you so much for sharing all this amazing info.  I have my referral and initial call from Mass General and am now waiting for the call for consult.  So excited and nervous at the same time.  I would love to see end results if you feel comfortable sharing them.  Private DM works perfect.
</p>
<p>
Thank you again!  ~Krisenia

Thank you so much for posting!! I&#39;m scheduled to have VP with them in a few months and I&#39;m worried about whether I&#39;ve had enough hair removal. If you feel comfortable answering - how much did you do before the surgery? Have you had any hair related issues post-op?
