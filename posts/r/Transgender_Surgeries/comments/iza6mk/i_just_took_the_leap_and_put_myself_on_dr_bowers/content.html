I’m excited, and wondering if I’m being too pre-emptive. I have FFS in a few days, and I guess it has me excited to start considering the next step...GRS. I really like Dr Marci Bowers. And today I bit the bullet and put myself on her, 3 year, waitlist. Which, I’m told could drop down to 2 years on the cancellation list.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else planned ahead like that? I’m sure I could do GRS way sooner with another doctor, but for some reason she just feels right for me. Has anyone here had GRS with her? Any comment would be welcome. Thank you. :)

I was considering her but ended up going with Dr. Brassard which still ended up being a 3 year wait when all was said and done thanks to covid.
</p>
<p>
No surgeon is perfect but one of the reasons I chose Brassard over Bowers was because of several complaints I&#39;d heard about her bedside manner and lack of empathy or concern for post-operative complications when they occur.
</p>
<p>
Many of her patients have perfectly fine surgeries and her good results do look really good but I would make sure you have a different doctor experienced with trans patients in place for your post operative care and concerns.

That is rather disappointing. All the press one hears about her is always so positive. I guess that&#39;s the spin machine for you. Does that mean that she is loathe to fix complications? I&#39;m glad I know this now

This is all second hand so take it with a grain of salt but I&#39;ve just heard she refuses to accept that there&#39;s ever anything wrong with her work. Egotistical attitudes aren&#39;t uncommon in specialist surgeons though so it could be blown out of proportion by people who aren&#39;t used to that.

What
<a href="/u/EmotionalAlligator" rel="nofollow">u/EmotionalAlligator</a>
explains is a good summary. Marci can usually be great with her surgeries—provided you&#39;re pretty much &#34;typical&#34; both in body and binary gender, as far as she&#39;s concerned—but outside of that she gets kinda weird and arrogant and generally awful. And, yeah, after-care or bed-side manner isn&#39;t her forte. She&#39;s ghosted me at this point... I&#39;m getting a revision with Dr. Wittenberg soon, so I&#39;m not sure surgical her results yet first hand, but I can speak to her ability to listen. And listen she does amazingly in as much of a kind, calm, level, and non-ego driven way as one can expect. Night and day difference there so far.
