The Mayo experience. The doctor was horrible at informing and I had to get second opinions to treat a complication he caused in surgery.

so glad to hear the complications are mostly resolved! you look beautiful, congratulations. as a fahradyan patient i can relate to feeling left in the dark after experiencing complications, though i was lucky enough to recover on my own. I&#39;m also able to self-lubricate, like you. i wonder why they tell us that only girls who get a PPV will be able to get wet

I still need a revision though he pushed through my rectal tissue and had to stop entirely for another surgeon to come in to fix his mistake . Judging on where the parts of  canal are Iâ€™d say it was almost entirely preventable if he had more experience. I regret not going with Dr. Martinez

I&#39;m sorry these complications have made your process so long. You&#39;re right to be frustrated. You&#39;re gonna finish this chapter and see the other side. Sending love

I would quite like PPV in a few years time, is there something&#39;s you don&#39;t like about it specialist? Or just that there&#39;s a stigma that it&#39;s the only way to have a self lubricating vagina?

the latter. in hindsight i understand i was probably told that for CYA reasons, since it&#39;s not a guarantee with PIV

If you had the choice, would you have gone for PPV instead? (Or would you go for that if you haven&#39;t already had SRS?)

Your canal cannot get wet when turned on.  Iâ€™m not saying this to be rude or something but please stop spreading misinformation. You can self lubricate if they used the peritoneum technique in you but it self lubricates on its own and whenever it wants to, not when you get turned on. Also is not the same as a cis gender vagina. A teenager is going to see this, think she can have a self lubricating vagina exactly like a cis woman and after surgery they will realise that wasnâ€™t the case and they are going to regret it.

Iâ€™m sorry your experience differs, i have a overactive Cowper gland, itâ€™s the part of your body that creates precum, i also had a ptt technique applied with my inversion, however as stated here and in several other of my past posts i donâ€™t have much depth. I canâ€™t comment on why any longer, but i can assure you, i in fact do lubricate when i am turned on. This is a very well documented phenomenon, and i suggest you look into the matter more as itâ€™s quite interesting.

Oh Iâ€™m terribly sorry! I thought you meant you can get lubricated when turned on from the cavity, not from the urethra, I got confused ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ sorry hahahha

Thatâ€™s okay! Thank you for keeping me in check! Very well appreciated ðŸ’•
</p>
<p>
The cavity for me is lubricated from the urethra, i should have specified this to avoid any misconceptions. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

Sucks about your experience with your Mayo surgeon- in general patient experience is something they do well. How was the rest of the team(s) you dealt with.
