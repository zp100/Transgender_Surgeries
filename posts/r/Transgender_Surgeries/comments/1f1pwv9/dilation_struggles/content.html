I‚Äôm two weeks post op, and I cannot get past the third/fourth dot on the purple dilator. I‚Äôve tried different positions, angles, and I can‚Äôt get it.
</p>
<p>
I see the surgical team tomorrow, so hopefully they will help. I‚Äôm just really worried I have lost a lot of depth because of this.

It is going to sound counter-intuitive, but try squeezing your pelvic muscles (kegals) while you have the dilator in.  Hold them for a count of 5, then relax while breathing out and giving the dilator a bit of pressure.  Do this 2-3 times in a row and see if it helps.  You are basically contracting the muscles tightly, then releasing which allows them to elongate more which lets them stretch.
</p>
<p>
This will be a bit uncomfortable, but it should not cause any significant pain.
</p>
<p>
And of course, if you aren&#39;t already seeing one, try to get in with a pelvic floor physical therapist.

Have you tried deep breathing and are you 100% relaxed? I found that that as well as just a good push gets it in!

First off you are WAY too early to be worried about losing depth. At 2 weeks post op, you will still have a ton of swelling which will make dilating for depth challenging.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon didn‚Äôt  even have me start dilating until 2 weeks post op and I can confidently say you don‚Äôt lose depth. I‚Äôm at the depth my surgeon anticipated I would have and have consistently made gains since I started 2 weeks after surgery. You lose depth easier once healing finalizes as scar tissue and fully healed tissue is much less malleable than tissue that is still healing.  This doesn‚Äôt occur until much later in the healing process.
</p>
<p>
If you are not already you should still be using two dilators. I know it‚Äôs a PITA, but at 2 weeks you should be using a smaller dilator for length and the largest you can manage for girth. You eventually can drop down to one if both achieve the same goal, that being expanding depth and width. Ask your provider for the smaller P1 or P2. They can also put your mind at ease as to where they expect you to be in regards to depth and goals. You should ultimately follow their recs,  but be mindful to consider what other girls have gone through and what they find works for them. At the end of the day we are the ones often having to teach providers what does and does not work.
</p>
<p>
If you can, see a pelvic floor therapist that specializes in post op trans care. Mine honestly knows WAY more about dilation, and what the best methods are to achieve my goals more so than my providers do.  My surgeon is amazing, but my PVT has been paramount to my success.
</p>
<p>
Best piece of advice‚Ä¶Relax. It‚Äôs a marathon and a half and you are not even remotely close to finishing the race. Our healing process demands we keep as positive of an outlook on things as possible.  Dont waste all that energy.

i actually dealt with the same thing, then i realized, i can get to the third dot, then over the course of a few minutes with some steady pressure i actually end up getting to depth. it might just be that you need to be stretched out a little bit. keep in mind that you are only 2 weeks post op and there is a BUTT TON of swelling. just take ur time with it and try to relax.. and also yes it does take time to learn how to control your pelvic muscles with ur new coochie, i&#39;m struggling with the same thing but we are both so early in our surgeries, we need to give our bodies some grace and allow it to heal before trying to pressure it to do what we want it to do. wishing you the best of luck mama ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is great advice.
</p>
<p>
Also I find getting a few extended sessions in helps as well. My dilations schedule is 3x/day for 20 mins each. I find that if I insert to what I think is full depth it‚Äôs really not by the end of the session. Getting it in a far as I can, applying light pressure while relaxing with music or a book and then once my 20 mins is up, I see if I can get any more depth. More often than not I get a little more and I will I will extend my session a bit if I can.  By me relaxing it let‚Äôs everything drop.  Understandably I have to get outa my head a bit for this to happen cuz like dilation sucks and can hurt so it‚Äôs natural to pucker up a bit.
