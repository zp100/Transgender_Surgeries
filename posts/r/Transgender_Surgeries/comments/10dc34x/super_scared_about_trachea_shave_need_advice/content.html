The important thing is that they don‚Äôt remove too much and damage your voice. There is a technique called ‚Äúneedle localization‚Äù where they use a guide or something during surgery to monitor progress and ensure they aren‚Äôt detaching your vocal cords. You don‚Äôt want a giant scar, but according to my doctor, who does vocal feminization surgery and a lot of repairs of people who had their voices damaged, attempting to use very distant incisions can increase the risk.

I had a trachea shave last year.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is the surgeon an ENT? I would trust an ENT over more general purpose surgeons, but it‚Äôs not necessarily a dealbreaker.
</li>
<li>
Where is the incision made? Best practice is to place it in the fold of the neck so that it can‚Äôt be seen when looking straight-on. A scar directly over the thyroid cartilage (Adam‚Äôs apple) will be much more visible.
</li>
<li>
What technique does the surgeon use? There are two techniques I know of: one, which is mostly done by lesser experienced surgeons, is to remove cartilage by ‚Äúfeel‚Äù. This runs the risk of removing too much, or not enough. Non-ENTs often use this method. The second technique involves placing a pin in the cartilage that prevents shaving off too much. This means you get the best result you can without the risk of complication.
</li>
<li>
Did anyone observe your vocal cords using a camera down your throat before the surgery?
</li>
<li>
If you don‚Äôt feel 100% confident in your surgeon‚Äôs abilities, ask questions until you do, and if you still don‚Äôt, find another surgeon. You really don‚Äôt want anyone inexperienced working near your vocal cords, they are very fragile and if a surgery goes wrong it could ruin your voice forever. Nothing about my surgery altered my voice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

The scar position in the photo you linked looks too low to me. It shouldn‚Äôt be visible in the front-on photo. Look at my scar placement in the thread I linked.

My throat was sore for awhile but that was mostly due to the intubation for anesthesia. I was a little raspy at first but my voice quickly returned.

Ive done tracheal shave without VFS. Surgery messed up my voice a year ago( he removed too much). I wanted to do a femlar but surgeon said she wouldnt take me after tracheal shave . You can see scars on my photos, its visible . Try to find as many reviews as you can .

You can&#39;t know how good they are if there&#39;s no reviews.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d ask where the incision will be. It shouldn&#39;t low down where its visible.

The women in the photos seems to have a very visible scar. That&#39;s not  good, bot the scar and its location.
</p>
<p>
Have a look at this video by Facial Team.

</ul>
<p>
I think some surgeons are like this because they trained to treat functional problems, but we also want aesthetic surgery.
