What are some items I should buy before getting FFS.
</p>
<p>
Things that you need to have? e.g. Silicon Gel etc
<br>
Things you wish you had? e.g. Books, Nintendo Switch, blender.
<br>
General tips for that first week or two?

I just had mine recently. About 3.5 weeks ago.  Get one of those neck pillows. You have to sleep vertically for 2 weeks or more. It will help. That was one of the hardest parts, sleeping sitting up.  Food wise all I could stomach for the first 3-4 days was apple sauce and yogurt. Lost like 10 lbs as a result. You definitely will not be hungry and it has to be super soft almost liquid or a liquid meal replacement also works.  I took Percocet the max I was allowed. It only partially helped. Take stool softeners. Trust me. I’m not going into detail. lol.

First off congrats! Neck pillow is genius I always forget about those things. There is some dumb part of my brain that gets excited at the thought of losing more weight, I will make sure to stock up on applesauce and yogurt. Oh also that last you mentioned, noted.

I gained all 10lbs back stupidly about 2 weeks later. Figured I had some leeway. Missed opportunity.

Stool softeners or the (Fleet brand) sterile enema bottles. That&#39;s the general anesthetic that causes that. My hip replacement and tonsillectomy surgeries...ugh.

Anesthesia is only a tiny part of it, and only for the first day or two. After that its the opiate pain killers that slow intestinal motility. Source: I&#39;m a nurse ♡

Are you going with Bryan Rolfes? If so good luck he seems to be a very good surgeon.

Yeah that&#39;s my plan right now. I may have to be alone when I get surgery so I want to make sure I buy everything I need for like 2 weeks. Scar gel, soft foods, ice packs, and other things that others who got surgery may have wanted or bought ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
It also might just be useful to have a list like this somewhere for anyone else getting surgery.

Oh hope it goes well. I wish I went with him. Lots of very positive reviews about him and his results are very good and natural. Good bedside manners too it seems.

Nope still have messed up lips, scarred neck, rolled in lip that&#39;s stretched towards my teeth, bump under chin is still there and all.
</p>
<p>
Just trying to live my life like normal despite feeling like a disabled deformed person. I still wake up with a feeling of dread and regret but can&#39;t do anything about it at the moment. Thanks for asking though.

If you&#39;re going to have lip work done, you probably will not be able to close your lips. Make small bite-sized snacks that you can literally push into your mouth. Watermelon is great for this.
</p>
<p>
Walk around every so often. My back ended up hurting worse than my face because I was laying around so much.
</p>
<p>
Bring something to watch. I was in too much pain to really think, so I never actually played any games that I brought.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly: BRING SOME MUSIC. I was literally shaking on the drive over. I put on a song that I knew would calm me down and I focused on it. I stopped shaking.

Besides the foods mentioned I would get
</p>
<p>
Individual tiny water bottles and maybe small capris suns
</p>
<p>
A good stand to put your laptop/phone/tablet or whatever you will be using to watch shows on. My hotel had a breakfast in bed type tray and I had a phone mount that I could place on it and have my phone playing shows. Personally I didn&#39;t do much of anything for the first few days so I don&#39;t kmow how important video games or books would be then.

things that you need....everything in your care packet.
</p>
<p>
things i wish i had....was honestly not in the mood to play video games or read. too much pain and discomfort for the first week to do that. so i watched tv in the hotel room. that was enough.
</p>
<p>
tips: follow every instruction in the care packet. to the letter. take all your meds. for the first 5 days, take your pain meds as instructed to remain as pain free as possible. if you only take them when you feel pain - then you&#39;re going to be in pain often. trust me this is going to be tough for the first 7 days. after that you&#39;re good. it&#39;s just waiting for everything to heal and swelling to go down.

If you&#39;re having jaw work and multiple incisions in your mouth, can you really use straws?

I haven&#39;t had FFS, but did have SRS.
</p>
<p>
I had a huge list of items prepared, specifically for the hospital stay: coloring supplies, fun coloring books, a bunch of movies, a bunch of games, dry shampoo, etc.
</p>
<p>
I basically just ate and slept for four days.
</p>
<p>
When I came home, I more or less ate and slept for another few days, then only had the energy to mope, lay motionless watching a movie before falling asleep.
</p>
<p>
Repeat for about 2 - 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Totally be prepared, but also be prepared to not use any of it.

Start drinking a lot of water, using strong chapstick, and exfoliating your lips a few weeks in advance. I did this and didn’t get chapped lips at all during surgery or recovery.
</p>
<p>
Get a humidifier for your lips and throat so you don’t dry out. Your nose gets really clogged from forehead and nose work, so you need to mouth breathe.
</p>
<p>
I got a couple large satin scarves that I covered my head wrap with for walks during my first few days of recovery. Those and bandannas or loose hats to keep the sun and prying eyes off your scars.
</p>
<p>
I ordered a few 50-60cc syringes online. Like, for Jell-O shots. They were the most unexpectedly helpful supplies. My lips were really numb and swollen, but the syringes helped me get my liquid food in my mouth instead of all over my chest. My lips were swollen to the point I couldn’t use a straw. I couldn’t even close my lips for a little over a week.
</p>
<p>
It would not have been the same without my amazing shakes that I ate for the first two weeks (blender was a necessity) I would blend 1 avocado, 1 banana, a few tablespoons of peanut butter, a few scoops of ice cream, whole milk, and some meal replacement powder (I used Huel). I ate it with a syringe. One serving would last about 2 meals and I never felt hungry.
</p>
<p>
The first two days after surgery I couldn’t eat more than 2-3 cups of jello in one day and I was having trouble swallowing. My throat was most likely sore from intubation. I was kind of a mess, but I was able to help myself to those.
</p>
<p>
You’ll need a lot of tissues for your drippy nose (I carried around a roll of toilet paper in my purse) as well as a bunch of q-tips and hydrogen peroxide for general cleaning.
