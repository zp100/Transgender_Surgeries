is a list of online therapists. In general asking if letters are accepted and looking up reviews may be a good idea.
</p>
<p>
Talking things through with a therapist may be an option. They may have experience what would be accepted. A number of people were able to have exceptions accepted, like no being able to fully come out due to job reasons etc. Remember Wpath is guidelines not laws so adaptions may be possible.

Just because bottom surgery wont effect ability to pass doesn&#39;t mean it wont provide relief from other issues. I dont pass 100%, but I&#39;m still working towards surgery because it is a major contributing factor to my dysphoria.

Just the laser focus on passing and presentation, along with the general idea of SRS turning a non-presenting trans woman into a &#34;man with a vagina.&#34; This is a bit shitty...

OP seemed pretty focused on the whole idea of passing too (essentially saying they weren’t going to transition —except for SRS— cuz they don’t think they could pass)  so the comment sort of lined up with that but I can see your point.

It&#39;s just clearly a truscummy perspective. Dictating from some standard of correctness what a transition should look like, shame associated with having a trans body... it&#39;s unhealthy, grating, and exhausting.

They &#34;validate&#34; this with letters from a therapist stating you have. I don&#39;t know how anyone can validate you &#34;presented&#34; for a year - I know cis women who only wear polos and baggy jeans/no makeup, sooo. I got my letter based on the fact that I &#34;came out&#34; socially a year ago.

It&#39;s entirely subjective (especially if you identify as &#34;agender&#34;). It&#39;s all down to getting a therapist to attest in writing.

Basically this. I “officially” came out in June but I had basically been out whenever I left the house since December of 18 except for work and my parents (I work at a school so we were unsure of the ramifications, which there were none, so we waited till summer break to make it easier, as for my parents....they’re just terrible people). My therapist noted this in the letter and had I wished to coincide my 1yr hrt with fulltime i could have easily made it happen. Im waiting till this summer so I have a solid six weeks of recovery with no loss of work. As for the requirement....I think its necessary. Starting HRT 6 months earlier was a god send because I already had breasts by the time I came out but that experience is what helped shape me. It sucks having to worry about that extra thing but learning to blend in, feminize myself, and socialize myself has been integral to the experience. I can see why insurance wants to make sure this is something you can handle before they shell out 50,000 on a surgery.  And most of all having to be patient has also helped my anxiety, confidence, and social skills since im selling the current me and not a perfect version of me. Once I have surgery this summer it will be a huge weight lifted for sure. But all the building blocks of emotional coping and support networks are all in place

I also forgot to mention most Drs will also require the 1 yr hormone/fulltime if they follow WPATH (most do) but they can be a bit more flexible than insurance.

I think a letter from your therapist or primary care provider would work. I even considered using my social media announcements for proof.
