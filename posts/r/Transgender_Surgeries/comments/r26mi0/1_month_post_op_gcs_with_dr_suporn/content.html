In response to some questions raised. Suporn&#39;s method is Non-Penile Inversion with Penile Flap. The material for the vagina is formed from the Scrotal Tissue. Following is an extract on a part of his technique.
</p>
<p>
&#39;Again focusing on the vagina to compare with the numerous limitations of penile inversion surgery documented above, vaginal depth is much less limited by the availability of penile tissue. The vaginal lining is formed by using a full thickness scrotal skin and penile skin flap, supplemented by urethral mucosa. In addition, the Suporn Technique also harvests tunica vaginalis from the testes. Tunica vaginalis derived from the abdominal peritoneum is a serous membrane that covers the testes. Because the testes per se are not used in the creation of the female genitalia, the tunica vaginalis offers an easily harvested and useful addition – where necessary – to line the vaginal cavity. This – along with urethra mucosa – is dramatically less invasive than a peritoneal pull-through technique.&#39;
</p>
<p>
Both Dr Suporn and Dr Bank utilize this method
</p>
<p>
On the topic of Dr Chettawut. I believe he has made a change/ or is about to Operating in a Private hospital here, rather than his clinic. A move I am sure all Dr Chet fans will be over the moon about.

Small correction to Krystal post. Both Suporn and Bank do complete Revisions, but they will only do revisions on their own work.
</p>
<p>
We opened for bookings for Revisions this month. At present we are scheduling three operations per week for this Cosmetic Improvement surgery. There will be no reduction to our GCS Program which can be seen on the schedule.

Congrats on your result. You look amazing. I have been thinking about who in thailand was going to do my surgery and was wondering why you picked suporn?

His results just seemed to look, to me, the most consistently aesthetically pleasing. though I have to admit I only really looked at Western surgeons otherwise and not at dr chett- for as far as I know chett performs the surgery at a private clinic and I liked having the security of having it done at a hospital..just in case (:

Did Suporn actually do yours, or was it one of his associates? I heard he doesn’t do too many anymore, unfortunately.
</p>

You look amazing, btw! Beautiful who-ha, there!! 😉

Wow! i&#39;m considering suporn, can i ask you two questions?
</p>
<p>
1.- when you ask them for a surgery date, how much time was it? six month, one year, two years? i&#39;ve seen their webpage and looks like he has a complete schedule untill late 2022.
</p>
<p>
2.- (the normal question) aproximately, how much cost the surgery for you?, i&#39;m triying to figure it out in order to check my savings and maybe ask for a loan if neccesary.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much!
</p>
<p>
PD: looks pretty good :o

Hi there.  1.I took advantage of all the covid travel restrictions and booked while they were still quite heavy- less than a year from first contact to surgery. 2. Surgery, hotel, flight tickets and food all in all ended up costing around €23K.
</p>
<p>
I hope that helps (:

Lovely! Dr. Suporn did a friend&#39;s bottom work, with similarly excellent results.
</p>
<p>
With regard to using penile skin for the vulva, isn&#39;t that common for zero-depth?

Amazing result. I have few questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
How was traveling back? The long plane flight sounds awful after such a huge surgery?!?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What was his pain managment like? I&#39;m so scared, since I never had major surgery, i know pain is to be expected, but some suregons really put more effort in making you as comfortable as possible, while others seem to not care once you are out of their operating room!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did you have epidural?
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Hi! I&#39;ll reply in order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
For traveling back I booked businessclass, so I could lay down.  It was a godsend and I slept the entire trip. Still, everything was sore and swollen from all the walking and such when I got home- I imagine flying back in economy is going to be awful.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Uh- I got lucky, I think. I had some oral pain killers during my first week in the hospital (but don&#39;t ask me which). I never had any pain and haven&#39;t used any painkillers at all since leaving the hospital.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes! I had the epidural or spinal, whichever it is. The one-time one. I&#39;d recommend it!
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Krystal I totally empathise with you on this. Certainly it is a grave situation. I have come across this all too many times. Some girls running through savings and loans to Revise inferior work. In nearly all cases most surgeons are frightened off by legal implications or career destroying linkage to the initially to the original surgery.
</p>
<p>
This is completely independant of the tragic  outcomes for you personally. Not least the mental anguish.
</p>
<p>
It is hard for me to see an adequate path through revision here. Rather it would seem, to me at least, a complete reconstruction. It is not easy to undo the damage that may be caused to the nervous system.
</p>
<p>
Your, possible best approach may be to consider the possibility of reconstruction using either a Sigmoid Colon or Jujenal approach to completely replace the original surgery. I am not even approach on this. Certainly the Suporn Clinic don&#39;t provide it. You may consider PAI, the &#39;Preecha Aesthetic Institute.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the liitle help I may have been but certainly we can keep talking it through at any time, if only as a good listener.

I think it&#39;s just from healing. Plus some of the stitches can scratch/poke in Awkward places..
