I don‚Äôt want this to be a huge rant, but I cannot in good faith recommend the LTC.
</p>
<p>
Super quick context:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Original surgery 2014, PI Mr Thomas
<br>
</li>
<li>
Revision with Mr Bellringer October 2019
</li>
<li>
Revision with Mr Inglefield February 2022
</li>
<li>
main problems excess erectile tissue (internal and external), as well as pain in vaginal canal making dilation/sex impossible
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After my original surgery I had a great deal of leftover erectile tissue. About 3/4 years in, I began to struggle with dilating. I would go on to discover several years later, this was due to internal granulation tissue. I didn‚Äôt even know this was something you could get that far into recovery.
</p>
<p>
Mr Thomas did my surgery in 50 minutes and did nothing short of butcher me. He was never interested in what I had to say in regard to my results, and was told over and over again to see a sex therapist. I completely disassociated from my vagina and let it be for several years.
</p>
<p>
Flash forward to 2019 I got a second opinion and then a surgery from Mr Bellringer - who was no better and did nothing other than give me an infection which required a trip to A&amp;E 2 days later.
</p>
<p>
Due to excess erectile tissue and the granulation (didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what it was at the time) I‚Äôve never been able to have vaginal sex, and gave up on dilation around 2018.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2021, I decided to go private and try to fix the whole thing. After much back and forth with surgeons in Thailand and the UK, I chose Mr Inglefield and the LTC. I immediately felt seen and understood and he confirmed all the problems I felt I had and vowed to fix it. I paid just shy of 20k and the experience has been nothing short of abysmal.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been lied to, gaslighted, and treated with nothing but utter contempt from this clinic. To cut a really long story short, nothing has changed - I‚Äôm still in the exact same position. Mr Inglefield never even attempted to remove the excess erectile tissue, and had the nerve to tell me it was never discussed. I left a detailed review on TrustPilot but the LTC has now flagged this for harmful or illegal content! LAUGHABLE.
</p>
<p>
My heart hurts because we‚Äôre so limited in the UK for trans care and I don‚Äôt want anyone else to experience what I have. Whilst we‚Äôre incredibly lucky to have the NHS, it‚Äôs not adequate for trans care.
</p>
<p>
I was swayed by Mr Inglefields  charisma and the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The point is, if you‚Äôre financial able to go private - please please please go to industry pioneers abroad. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre always perfect, nothing ever is, but having experience with most of the UK SRS surgeons, it‚Äôll never ever be worth it. I‚Äôve seen people share positive reviews of UK SRS surgeons, and I so wish that was my experience.

Are you saying they shouldn&#39;t even take into account negative reviews? Come on. Sometimes surgeons do a bad job on patients or disregard patients&#39; problems and that is something people should be aware of before choosing whether or not to have surgery with someone. Your experience was real, and so was OP&#39;s, and both experiences should be taken into account before making a decision.

I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you ): I 100% agree with you how UK trans care is garbage i‚Äôm a NHS patient too and I had my surgery with Tina Rashid i‚Äôm really happy with my results but the way they treat me in that hospital especially with the covid restrictions was horrible I felt more like just money than an actual person
</p>
<p>
I barely saw or talked to my surgeon she was always rushing probably cause she was busy with other people but the nurses had an attitude they practically forced me to get up and move around not even 2 days after surgery which ended up with me throwing up everywhere and almost passing out
</p>
<p>
They got annoyed with me calling all the time when I couldn‚Äôt do anything myself like sorry for asking you to do your job i‚Äôd do it myself if I could üôÉ practically nothing I did was enough if I wanted to rest they would just tell me to get up when I literally went on a walk earlier that experience was more traumatising than anything they don‚Äôt actually care about us

St George&#39;s Hospital??
</p>
<p>
To be fair I&#39;ve heard and seen similar first hand reports (my elderly Father&#39;s been an inpatient there a couple of times) about St George&#39;s for completely non trans related stuff...
</p>
<p>
From what I&#39;ve read Tina Rashid seems to have mostly happy patients and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re another one of them! üòä
</p>
<p>
The poor NHS on the other hand is on its knees - and I&#39;d better not get started on the politics of it all, as something may get broken!!
</p>
<p>
Tim Larner in Brighton also seems to get good reviews, which I hope are an accurate reflection of his work as I&#39;ve just been referred to him... But I&#39;m also keeping an open mind as no surgery is without risk, so I think it&#39;s more a matter of trying to find the surgeon with the least reported problems.
</p>
<p>
My heart goes out to the OP - things just seem to have gone from bad to worse... üòî I&#39;m so sorry.

Parkside Hospital it looks really nice and inviting but once your in and you‚Äôve had surgery you‚Äôre basically money that needs to leave in 5-7 days there was some nurses who were really nice but sadly there was more rude ones ):
</p>
<p>
Before I had surgery when you have to get an enema there was this man that did it and he literally forced it into me and made me bleed (good thing I didn‚Äôt get any complications from that üôÉ)
</p>
<p>
There was a night nurse that came in to literally scold me saying something like ‚Äúi‚Äôve just had to leave an elderly woman to come help you‚Äù when I was in pain how is that my fault no one told you to leave her
</p>
<p>
And yeah Tina is a really good surgeon i‚Äôm very happy with my results I did a post with my results a few weeks after &amp; 2 months after but I deleted them since I had to deal with alot of creepy men that shouldn‚Äôt be in here and I dont feel safe with my vagina online i‚Äôm over 1 year post op now
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm grateful for the NHS since I got to transition from when I was 12 which wouldn‚Äôt be possible now since they banned it I feel so sorry for all the people that are the age I was just a few years ago who cant ‚òπÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
&amp; yeah she‚Äôs really had it really rough another victim of a nasty surgeon who cared more about what he wanted for her he clearly never listened to her at all just treat her like money happens alot ):

Oh - Parkside!! Thanks for the heads up! (I thought they&#39;d be better than St George&#39;s... üò¨)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so pleased for you that you were able to start transition so young, clearly it makes a huge difference... Good news is the last I heard the ban on puberty blockers was overturned on appeal, so it is possible for others. If still not easy.
</p>
<p>
But despite everything I&#39;ve high hopes that overall things are slowly moving in the right direction, albeit with many backward steps along the way, as I&#39;ve seen so much change in my lifetime.
</p>
<p>
I was 12 in 1983... I ended being admitted to hospital (at 12!) with what I now think was a nervous breakdown. Basically got told to &#34;man up&#34; pull myself together and sent on my way. ü•∫ I only started sorting out the problem a few years ago when I began self medicating with hormones age 46 (after years of drinking, smoking &amp; suicide attempts later...).
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there&#39;s still not a shortage of surgeons with a &#34;God Complex&#34;, who think they know best, won&#39;t listen, and are complete arseholes if things don&#39;t go right. Often they&#39;re also some of the best ones! Which makes choosing so impossibly difficult.
</p>
<p>
I am now a happy customer of the LTC for my hormones, but I&#39;m getting quite wary of Mr Inglefield for surgery as this isn&#39;t this first time I&#39;ve heard of him being nasty to anyone who has the audacity to complain.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bellringer also seems to have an attitude problem if you&#39;re anything less than delighted with his work...
</p>
<p>
My thanks to the OP for posting as it&#39;s all useful information when deciding where to go.
</p>
<p>
God I wish I&#39;d been able to transition young, but one (&amp; possibly the only!) advantage of now being in my 50s is that I do find I get a bit more respect from healthcare professionals, who are now very often younger than me, even some of the surgeons!

No problem! They are probably better than alot of places but they still mistreat people i‚Äôm traumatised from the experience I had with them
</p>
<p>
&amp; thank you so much but please don‚Äôt feel bad i‚Äôm so sorry you have been through so much and you had to live in a time where people were so judgmental &amp; clueless that it wasn‚Äôt possible for you to do it too it‚Äôs never too late to start i‚Äôve seen people much older than you on here transition so don‚Äôt beat yourself up for it it‚Äôs not your fault ü§çü´Ç
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve talked to some girls who had surgery with Bellringer here and they always seem to have problems with their stitches or scarring even though I had surgery with Tina I actually saw him more at parkside than her and he seemed nice to me I guess cause I wasn‚Äôt actually one of his patients? idk
</p>
<p>
&amp; yeah alot of surgeons are taking advantage of our dysphoria and they don‚Äôt actually care about us at all I saw someone post about a surgeon here who charges ¬£71k for FFS it‚Äôs way too much

I know someone who has their BA and a nose job there and she was treated pretty much the same. No aftercare and shitty service from then when she went back to then to sort it.

Jumping on this, the LTC are condescending, love to make you feel like you&#39;re mad and out of line for asking for basic support, and impossible to contact.
</p>
<p>
Avoid as best you can, or make sure you&#39;ve got a good network of support around you who can back you up and ask questions on your behalf at appointments.
</p>
<p>
Any surgery, they&#39;ll kick you out within hours if they can. Even the NHS keep you overnight for a mastectomy. Cheap, lousy management for an obscene Harley St private price - not even ON Harley Street! Says it all.
