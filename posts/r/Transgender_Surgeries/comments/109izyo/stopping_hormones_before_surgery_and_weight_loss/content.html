I know this has been discussed here extensively. My doctor asked me to stop hormones 40 days before surgery. He lets parents get back on hormones a month after.
</p>
<p>
I also know this is very controversial, because there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough evidence nowadays hrt offers risks, especially in my case, I use patches. One can&#39;t get safer than that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a bit worried about masculinization before surgery, but I&#39;m also interested in hearing those who did stop and how it contributed (or didn&#39;t) to their weight loss. I&#39;d like to lose some weight before surgery.

You might want to review some of the more recent research:
</p>
<p>
No Venous Thromboembolism Increase Among Transgender Female Patients Remaining on Estrogen for Gender-Affirming Surgery
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33417686/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33417686/</a>
</p>
<p>
Current evidence does not support routine discontinuation of all CSHT [cross-sex hormone treatment] prior to surgery, particularly given the lack of information on risks associated with resuming these medications after they have been stopped.
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30516808/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30516808/</a>
</p>
<p>
And tangentially related: We found no association between perioperative hormone replacement and post-operative thrombosis in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.

I was told to cease E prior to my GRS. I said sure and continued injecting. I was aware of the studies and know most doctors are ignorant when it comes to transgender medicine, strongly litigation opposed and not really concerned about patients outside the surgery.

Old post, but don&#39;t they require a blood test or something to confirm? Because I&#39;d like to follow this advice, but I don&#39;t want to have mine cancelled because they gave me a blood test the week before or immediately prior.

Yes, blood tests but not hormone levels, so they had no idea.

I stopped HRT for 2 months and my skin became more oily, facial hair grew stronger (surprisingly body hair didn&#39;t change), breast size went down by 2cm, which is the worst!!! In retrospect, I would have never ceased HRT!

Did you have facial hair then? I don&#39;t have it anymore, but I&#39;m afraid of it coming back.

Hormone changes affect the state of the hairs, some that are vellous (the thin white ones covering your body) can randomly become terminal hairs  (beard eyebrows head etc) from hormone changea throughout life. Thats why laser hair removal may be permanent on the hairs it has already removed but it has no effect on hairs that werent terminal at the time kf treatmwnt

I had ppv and went off hormones 10 days before and continued when I left the hospital at 3 days post op.
</p>
<p>
I have had zero issues.  If you don’t have any clotting disorders and are generally healthy I feel like the requirement to stop hormones is outdated and possibly even harmful.  Definitely overly protectionist.
</p>
<p>
I’m pretty sure there’s even been research out of Mt. Sinai NY that shows that maintaining hormones does not result in any increased risk of DVT or other complications whereas stopping hormones almost universally increased mental health struggles during recovery.  I would definitely talk to the surgeon about it and if they won’t budge on the requirement I might consider going to someone else.

I would talk to the surgeon about your concerns.  It is possible to run a blood test to check for clotting issues so it isn’t something that cannot be known.

Hmm.  A few questions pop to mind.
</p>
<p>
What surgeon is it?
</p>
<p>
How old are you?
</p>
<p>
Is there a different surgeon you can go to who is more responsive to your concerns?

Okay.  I don’t what to tell you then.  Almost 2 months off of surgery is guaranteed to bring some masculinization back.  It will be really rough.  I’m sorry.

I went off hormones for a total of 3 weeks (2 before, 1 after) and honestly didn’t notice anything, although the lupron I was on before was likely still suppressing my testosterone during that time. It may have made me a bit more emotional, but surgery is an emotional time anyway so it’s hard to tell. I wasn’t trying to lose weight at the time, and didn’t notice any changes.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

AA&#39;s are shitty for you and complicate things in terms of surgical.risk assessment.  You&#39;re well advised to stop AA&#39;s.  E is fine to keep using.  If you&#39;ve had any sort of good atrophy if you were on decent hrt, junk doesn&#39;t spring back to life in any sort of short time frame.

I&#39;m actually only on E because of atrophy. When I had my face done the doctor told me to stop E, but said I could go on with AAs. Why are they shitty?

Spironolactone is good for reducing hypertension, so for those people it may be a positive, but because it messes with your electrolyte balance, and if you have normal BP otherwise, it isn&#39;t necessarily helpful. It is listed as something a surgeon may ask you to stop before surgery.  CPA is just a shitty drug that has more downsides than benefits.  Bica - I don&#39;t know enough about in terms of surgery risk.

My experience with CPA has been nothing but extremely positive, to the point I&#39;m not even on AAs anymore. But yes, it&#39;s a very strong drug to be used with caution.

I was told to stop HRT for a month before and after surgery. I managed 5 weeks and I think my friends were really glad when I got back on it!

I wouldn&#39;t recommend losing to much weight before surgery as your body burns fat to heal. The healthiest weight to survive surgery and emergencies is overweight with average weight and obese tied for less safe and morbidly obese being just slightly less dangerious than underweight. Underweight being the deadliest bmi. I was at 167 before my first surgery and started eating some treats to increase weight before surgery. Came out of top surgery at 176. Went up to 179 the day after surgery. 4 weeks from surgery, I&#39;m now 172 with light snacking but mostly returned to my original eating habits.

I stopped hormones about 2 weeks before the surgery and went back on them about 2 weeks after. I did lose a bit of weight while in the hospital, and put that weight plus more back on after, but that might have been more down to my diet during each of those periods than the hormones. I did experience a small amount of breast degradation, though (I could more easily feel dense breast tissue prior to hospitalization than I could after).

Wow, only 4 weeks had a difference on your breasts! Any masculinizing effects?

None that I&#39;ve noticed. And ultimately I&#39;m not that surprised about my breasts, considering it took me so long (started HRT in Dec. 2020, didn&#39;t start really noticing breast growth until probably April 2022) to even get to the growth that I had. Now that I&#39;m post-op and my estrogen has spiked over where it was (my labs went from 130 pre-op to 205 post-op), I&#39;m hoping to see a lot more growth now.
</p>
<p>
[EDIT] I also remained on spiro until the day before my surgery -- it was only the estrogen that I stopped.
