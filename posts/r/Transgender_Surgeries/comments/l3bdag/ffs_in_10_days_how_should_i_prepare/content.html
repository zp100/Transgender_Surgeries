Get off alcohol, cigarettes, weed for sure. Don&#39;t take any pain killers with anti coagulant properties (ibuprofen)
</p>
<p>
You may many to have an increased diet for a few days as well (ideally healthy high protein foods), since you&#39;ll have a tough time eating for a while post op and will likely lose weight.
</p>
<p>
And stay very hydrated until your fast starts.

Keep under 1.5g of salt a day and under 200g of carbs a day. They promote swelling.
</p>
<p>
If you are getting jaw work, figure out your liquid diet ahead of time. I really recommend meal replacement shakes if you can get them. You won’t be able to open your mouth very wide or to chew for 10-14 days.
</p>
<p>
After surgery really try to be up and walking as soon as you can. Try to walk for a few hours a day, even if it’s in little 15 minutes bursts. This really helps lower swelling.
