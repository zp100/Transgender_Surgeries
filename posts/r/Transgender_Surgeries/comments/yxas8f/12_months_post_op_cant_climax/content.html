Just like the title says,  I&#39;m just over a year post PI vaginoplasty and still haven&#39;t been able to climax.
</p>
<p>
I have a revision booked with a different surgeon in less than a month to clean up the mess that the first one left me with. I doubt anything can be done about the lack of sensation though.
</p>
<p>
Are there any girls here in the same boat ?
</p>
<p>
How the hell do you deal with being slightly aroused and not being able to do anything about it ?
</p>
<p>
I think it could be that my T is now way below cis female levels at &lt;0.1 nmol/L basically off the bottom of the chart. Would this impact my ability to enjoy touching myself ? My E levels are fine at ~500pmol/L.
</p>
<p>
Anything at all ?

It took me more than 7 months and I know many took way longer than a year to orgasm. For me, it happened by accident. When I was dilating I didn&#39;t want to waste the lube I was using and was exploring myself and enjoying the feelings. It took a long time that night because it just felt good. I guess I was relaxed enough. Then it happened unexpectedly. But I couldn&#39;t figure out how I managed to orgasm and it took many more months before I had another.
</p>
<p>
How much feeling do you have? What did your surgeon do and what kind of revision are you looking to have?

I believe raising T levels may help. Do you actually feel nothing on your clitoral region, or you are just unable to orgasm?

There is some sensation there but not enough and it goes numb after a while.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping to have access to a very small dose of T gel after my revision. Im hoping this works.

Very little unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
Using a vibrator on my mons pubis has slightly more sensation than the clitoris (nerve bundle pedicle is on the bone) but it&#39;s not enough and goes numb after a few minutes.

If you can feel anything then the nerves still work and it should be recoverable.
</p>
<p>
Are you taking antidepressants?

I&#39;m almost off the antidepressants, minimal dose every other day weaning my body off them.
</p>
<p>
Im still having to take amitriptyline for neuropathic pain caused by femoral or sacral nerve damage in the operation though. Smaller dose than i was on but without it i can&#39;t sit in my office chair all day.
</p>
<p>
I really hope it&#39;s recoverable, it&#39;s driving me  bonkers.

Babygirl, amitriptyline can cause impotence/inhibits libido in AMAB patients. Who is your doctor?

Doctor is just a general NHS Gp that did what she could to help with the neuropathic pain last year. The surgeon was bloody useless. I didn&#39;t realize the amitriptyline would also be an issue grrrr.
</p>
<p>
Any suggestions about anything else i can try,  its too painful without taking something. Will Gabapentin have the same effect ?

Gab does the same thing. Have you tried non-drug intervention to address the pain (yoga, physical therapy, muscle development)?

I previously got laughed at on here for mentioning pelvic floor physiotherapy but it has actually worked and reduced the pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also quite fit, running a few days a week and close to getting the splits, lots of stretching etc. That&#39;s part of why I&#39;m so upset that my result is so poor and i have been left in pain. I&#39;m not young (around 40) but i can run half marathon and I really look after my body. I just wish this pain would go away.
</p>
<p>
What you have said has brought up a very early memory before i started on the amitriptyline and was on tramadol. I remember feeling something then but was too scared of damaging it...... im going to try dropping the ami from tonight and see how it goes. If that means I&#39;m back on tramadol so be it ( thankfully i have a box full :) I really like the way ami makes me sleep but if i get an O im sure it&#39;s worth it ðŸ˜‚

You got laughed at for talking about pelvic floor PT after SRS?? That&#39;s so crazy. There are lots of stories out there of it helping tremendously with post-op pain and function. Many believe it should be standard practice.

I really think it should be offered to everyone post op and not be something i had to investigate myself.  Thankfully moaning to my doctor worked and she helped me a lot in the end.

Honestly, most of your issue is probably mental... the mental roadblock on how to stimulate that area can be a bit of a learning curb. For me I did not just focus on the exposed clotoris, but you can also focus on the arousal tissue behind it... I was doing it all wrong for me at first with too much pressure. In the end, a lighter touched did the trick. So you may want to try different pressures.

I agree it probably is. Once it&#39;s fixed and hopefully looks a lot better i may feel more comfortable with it. As it is i find it difficult to touch it as it looks horrific and i can feel the raised scar lines every time i go near it.

i also find direct stimulation w/ vibrator numbs my clit quickly. for me, the clit suction type vibrators work better than say, the magic wand, which was my go to pre-op, although those also are often too much and i have to warm up to them.
</p>
<p>
i also think i like just using my fingers best, but i have to be reaaalllyyy lubed up and start w/ labia, hood, mons, etc, basically i dont even really touch my clit until im getting close. also penetration at the same time helps a lot, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
finally, try t gel !! foreal, it&#39;s helped my libido soooo much and orgasm is way more of a mental game now, so arousal is at least half the battle. my t was like 15ng/dl, compared to 35 before surgery, and i was hella depressed, apathetic about sex, etc. after a few days of ~2mg/day gel on my shoulders my depression has been a lot better, im horny, and just have more &#39;drive&#39; in general to do things. anecdotally, the few days i have forgotten the gel have been my worst depression days since starting.
