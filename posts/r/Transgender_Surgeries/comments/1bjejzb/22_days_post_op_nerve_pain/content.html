So Iâ€™m 22 days post-op. I had PIV surgery, and today the nerve pain around the stitches on the lips has been intense, and I have not experienced this intensity until today. The pain is superficial on the incisions where the stitches are. I feel some sharp or shooting pain. The best way I can describe it is that it feels as if the stitches were coming unstitched. I&#39;ve felt this pain before, but today was the strongest Iâ€™ve felt it. I was told to expect this nerve pain, but damn, this morning was intense, and I&#39;m scared to dilate or move. The pain is just superficial, where the labia majora is. Has anyone else gone through this?

It will go away. Maybe not today or for a but but slowly. Also use vitamine e oil on your scars and massage them.

Itâ€™s not a continuous pain, but out of nowhere it just hits me for a few seconds, but wow, it put me through it.  It suckâ€™s knowing that itâ€™s going to continue to happened randomly ðŸ˜­

From my reading, nerves start their healing process after about 2 weeks, so 22 days is 3 weeks so it&#39;s still on track.
</p>
<p>
The reconnection and remapping as the brain processes signals is going to definitely be the more intense pins and needles feeling like when your leg or arm falls asleep and you wake it up.

Having sharp, intense, sporadic pain, is very common after any surgery. It is part of the process of healing, but can be very surprising and frightening at the same. It will get better, and what you need is just time. Unless itâ€™s constant, and increasing in intensity you shouldnâ€™t worry. BTW, itâ€™s nice to see another Chicago sister posting. If you have any questions, feel free to ask vis DM.

Your body is remapping the nerves, I am almost 6 weeks and I still get it but not as intense now.

Think of it like the body trying to make sense of a new organ, nerve endings trying to reconnect, I&#39;m not a doctor, but imagining this made me endure it better ðŸ˜Œ I actually felt electrical shocks sometimes, very random in duration and intensity

Very accurate description, Iâ€™ve been feeling the pain for the last 2 weeks but since this morning itâ€™s been super intense.

Yes - the pains have sometimes  been intense enough to take my breath away.  Two months on and they still hit out o nowhere every now and again.  All the best with your recovery
