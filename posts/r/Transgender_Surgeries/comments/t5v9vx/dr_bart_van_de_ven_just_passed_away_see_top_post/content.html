But bart van de ven has been a total scam and an evil person in the life of vulnerable trans patients - botched and ruined people&#39;s life.  People, as alike me, should &#34;never&#34; withdraw the legal cases against him- to those he&#39;s caused harm and made permanent damage to those. The legal battle should continue. Because, it&#39;s not just him, but his entire team - the 2pass clinic. And, his predecessors should face the brunt of the back-and-forth of the legal cases.
</p>
<p>
Never would say, Rest in peace. But, yes, nobody can escape &#34;Karma&#34;.

How did he botch you may I ask? He was my number one choice for ffs, 2nd is Facial Team. His website has tons of happy patients. Are there a bunch of cases where he completely messed up and botched a bunch of people? If so, he should have had his medical license revoked. I’m seeing another doctor for plastic surgery and found out he had his license revoked in one of the states in the US, but his YouTube channel has loads of people that swear by him and my experience has been good with him.

I don&#39;t know much about this guy beyond the few things (not good ones) that I&#39;ve seen mentioned here but it seems extremely problematic that his clinic is named the freaking 2pass clinic, like what the hell?!?!?!

Why is it problematic? Most trans women’s goal is to pass lol. What was problematic about his clinic was how many people he botched.

Thing is, with how much body dysmorphia is going round this community, in my opinion, such marketing terms are predatory.
