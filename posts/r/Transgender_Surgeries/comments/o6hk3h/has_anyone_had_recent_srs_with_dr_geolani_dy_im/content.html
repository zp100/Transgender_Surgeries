I&#39;ve recently put in a request for referral to OHSU for the peritoneal pass through vaginoplasty with Dr Dy. I&#39;m super hopeful that it will be aesthetically accurate and near cis functionally given the 60 years of use for MRKH syndrome despite the seemingly newer use for trans women. The nature of the learning hospital prevents them from publicly disclosing the results which makes it frustrating. I got a link to a vast resource that had a couple people post post-op photos which seemed good. I know not everyone is comfortable with sharing something so personal with the world but some people seem fine with dms. For some reason I&#39;m not too worried about complications or general functional issues. I&#39;m more concerned specifically about the vulva shape and appearance and the lubrication. I&#39;m totally fine with using lube, they are well marketed after all. I&#39;m just worried about the supposed issue that you discharge so much that you have to wear panty liners for most of your life. Any testimonials about her work or other peritoneal surgeons would be greatly appreciated.

I went looking for this too and there&#39;s just not a lot available. I had my consult with her last month and the aesthetics were fairly accurate. none of the examples had the vaginal canal below the labia or anything like that. she also let me know that she&#39;s partnered with a plastic surgeon who specializes in labial reconstruction to do that portion of the surgery, so presumably the external aesthetics will only improve. I&#39;m planning to meet him before the surgery so I can make a couple of requests -- primarily that I&#39;d like them to minimize the use of penile skin for the vaginal canal and to prefer the peritoneal flap, much as they do for MRKH patients, such that as much of the penile skin can be used for labial reconstruction as possible. apparently, the labia minora are what become the outer layers of the penis in the first place so the skin is very similar, whereas the peritoneal skin will undergo metaplasia within the canal, becoming functionally identical to a cis vaginal canal, unlike external skin like penile or scrotal.

<p>
from what I&#39;ve been able to glean from research and my conversation with the resident who handled my consult questions, while this can happen, most often this is only an issue for the first year. once the peritoneal skin undergoes metaplasia, it stops producing excessive discharge. that said, YMMV. personally, I much prefer having a canal that&#39;s as close to cis as possible so I don&#39;t have to deal with douching constantly due to what kinds of flora and fauna the skin will or won&#39;t support. I&#39;m also planning to supplement a probiotic to help with this process.
</p>
<p>
something else they let me know prior to the consult was that the recovery for this version of the procedure is apparently faster than the traditional PI. they have patients on their feet within a couple of days and dilating before they discharge you from the hospital rather than having to wait until the first post-op. that also greatly appeals to me.
</p>
<p>
I did ask her how many procedures she&#39;s performed and she&#39;s crossed the 100 mark at this point, which greatly reduces my anxieties about it. she said she&#39;s done 75 as the primary surgeon and a bit over 25 revisions.
</p>
<p>
I did do a bunch of searching through reddit and other forums to see what people had written about her and very, very few people have posted anything about the full PPT procedure. I only found one. there are a bunch of posts about folks who went to her for minimal-depth procedures, though, and the aesthetics were again quite good. if you haven&#39;t already found and seen these, let me know, and I&#39;ll link them here.

My only resources are the wiki on this subreddit about page. I&#39;m pretty sure Dugi, the director of surgery, is the assisting physician and I honestly don&#39;t like his aesthetics from what I&#39;ve seen so it suprises me that he may be considered a specialist. And her aesthetic seemed better so it&#39;d be odd if she doesn&#39;t even do that. I am really relieved that the discharge is likely temporary. I really appreciate the input :). If you have photo links different than the ones in the reddit I&#39;d definitely like to see them.

I don&#39;t think so, they mentioned someone else but it was a little too quick to catch. at this point, Dr. Dy and Dr. Dugi see their own patients for separate procedures, apparently. this was a separate surgeon they were bringing in for improved aesthetics - maybe there were some issues or two people can work faster? I don&#39;t know. I was planning to ask about it at the one month pre-op.
</p>
<p>
so I don&#39;t have the photos that she showed me at the consult but I did find a bunch of threads that weren&#39;t linked from the wiki. give me a bit and I&#39;ll dig them out. there&#39;s some stuff that links to a third-party image hosting site for trans surgery stuff that I never managed to figure out.

Oh ok cool it would be nice to get a professional vulvologist on site (that&#39;s what I&#39;m calling him lol). I should also ask, how long from consult is the surgery? I just assume it&#39;s around the same 3-6 months like i was told ffs should be. My ffs consult is in feb 2023 so i figured I&#39;d have it done by fall and i was hoping to have my srs done by fall next year so i have a full year in between so my body can focus the healing.

my consult was at the very end of May and they scheduled me for the very end of September, so 4 months in total. this was faster than I expected, primarily because my hair removal has progressed relatively quickly.

I just had my consult last week and I liked Dr. Dy. Dr Blair Peters (he/they and cisish) is going to assist Dr. Dy (taking over Dr. Dugi’s role in PPTV) starting in October this year. Dr. Blair Peters studied under Dr. Dugi. I believe they joined OHSU in
<a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2019/08/28/ohsu-expanding-improving-transgender-health-services" rel="nofollow">summer 2020
</a>
. Dr. Peters also spent time
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/doctor-goes-to-states-for-trans-bottom-surgery-training-1.5187190" rel="nofollow">training in peripheral nerve and microsurgery
</a>
which sounds rare for a bottom surgery surgeon to train in, or at least the combination of training in nerve and microsurgery and practicing bottom surgery is. While new, he definitely sounds like someone who is passionate and is certainly doing gender affirming surgeries for the right reasons. He likes to be visible (
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/queersurgeon/" rel="nofollow">IG
</a>
) and uses the term reluctant activist

Oh really? Ya better double check. I hope you meet him before your surgery! Please come back and let us know how you liked them if you have Dr. Peters instead of Dr. Dugi. Heck probably do it regardless if you can, there’s a dearth of info on OHSU surgeons. I suspect that people who don’t have much choice in surgeons typically don’t write about their experiences

Thank you for this very informative surgery information. Yes, I had vulvoplasty by Dr. Dugi, but later wanted to go for my vaginoplasty because of the work I do, time wasn’t in my favor to stick with the dilation schedule. The place I work at now, I have much more time to dilate and can stick with the regimen schedule given. Also at the the time after surgery, I didn’t know the full exact time I’d be staying in Portland, so that was another factor I didn’t factor in was not knowing we were going to have this mess up Covid Pandemic. So had I known something like this was going to happen, I would have done the Peritoneal Vaginoplasty. I still have scrotal skin as my vulva so maybe that can be trimmed and shortened for sure where my clitoris can be seen more possibly. 🤔
</p>
<p>
I do want to have Dr. Geolani Dy do my Peritoneal Vaginoplasty sometime in the near future. It’s just the health care provider with their transgender department doesn’t really understand why I still want my vagina after the fact that I had gotten my new vulva.

I had Dr. Dy and Dr. Peters do my bottom surgery and they are both wonderful people. They are knowledgeable and their bedside manner is very pleasant. I had the utmost confidence in both of them.
</p>
<p>
I’m post-op by just over a week, but am quite happy with the results thus far. Recovery has been pretty speedy as well and the pain has been tolerable (I was prescribed Acetaminophen - 325mg, Ibuprofen - 600mg, and Oxycodone - 5mg for pain management; Polyethylene Glycol for helping with BMs, which I only really needed to use for the first couple of days).
</p>
<p>
Just be sure to follow the list they provide concerning items to have post-op recovery, and rest often once post-op!
