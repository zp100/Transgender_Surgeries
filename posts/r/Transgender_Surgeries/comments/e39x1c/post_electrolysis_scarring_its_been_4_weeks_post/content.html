Post electrolysis scarring. It’s been 4 weeks post galvanic electrolysis and my face used to be silky smooth, now looks like acne scars. Is this just part of the healing process or is this permanent?

did you have to hold a rod during electrolysis or no?

My electrolygist insists the version you don’t hold an electrode isn’t as effective as the non electrode version, but I don’t remember why.

I don’t understand how this is happening . Is it skin type or just a harsh treatment?

As I understand it some skin types are more sensitive and galvanic can be harsher on the skin. I&#39;m no expert. I know some people who used the same electrolysist and machine and have zero scaring.

What is happening is the collagen in your skin is being affected which causes the skin to deflate and create a pitting effect.  I had this happen to me but because it was an accident of the wrong method used (was the same as yours).  This is &#39;permanent&#39; if no extra action is taken.  The damage could well be reversed through the use of skin needling. I know this because I had it done to me.
</p>
<p>
The damage for me occurred about 5 months ago and I have since had about 4 or 5 skin needling sessions done with maybe one or two left (they were complimentary because the scarring was an error).  To be honest it now looks back to normal.  You cannot really tell I had any damage.  What happens when you get skin needling done is the micro needles jab the underlying parts of your skin which causes micro damage to the skin. It doesn&#39;t sound good but trust me it is a good damage.  This damage then stimulates collagen to weave into the &#39;damaged&#39; skin and this effect re-builds the lost collagen and essentially makes the skin resurface itself to normal.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Skin needling doesn&#39;t hurt anything like electrolysis does. If electrolysis is a 9/10 then skin needling is a 1 or 2.  The feeling is like shaving with a razor that you know is going blunt but isn&#39;t cutting you just yet.
</p>
<p>
Speak with your electrolysist next time you go in and raise your concerns.  If you do scar, then they should offer to reverse it with skin needling at no extra cost.  It just means you shouldn&#39;t be having a) that type of electrolysis done to you and b) any electrolysis done on the skin needling areas for at least 5 months so it can heal.

Mine scars still there (15 session electrolysis, 1,5 year), it improved a little bit after some time, also interesting moment - laser epilation  plus some injections helps a little bit. The most problem for me it&#39;s pegmentation above upper lip. I hope on laser resurfacing after I&#39;ll finish electrolysis

Hi,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a professional electrologist, and am often called on to give bits of advice to transgender folks  on scarring etc post electrolysis. I&#39;ve also looked at your previous post while you were having it done, so I have a good idea of the post treatment scabbing and time frames involved.
</p>
<p>
First, I will say, that you cant tell anything from the skin 4 wees post treatment. This is when your sin is most going to show you the worst it has to offer. The vast majority of what you see, will resolve completely over the coming months. It&#39;s at least an 18 month healing process , most of which you cannot see. I would highly recommend viewing the following video by Michael Bono which describes this healing process very well:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viKQcBAHLOI&amp;list=PLeYuCaeN4D7PpsKYHFJ7tKr0yJoIyTSQO">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viKQcBAHLOI&amp;list=PLeYuCaeN4D7PpsKYHFJ7tKr0yJoIyTSQO
</a>
</p>
<p>
Try not to panic, what you see is NOT the end result. After seeing the initial photos, it looks a little rough, but the honey coloured scabbing post galvanic is NORMAL HEALING.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll pop in a bit more with more information for you, when I dont have to rush to treat another client :)

How many months should I wait before having further hair removal in the treated areas? The clinic advised me 6-8 weeks, which I feel is far too soon. Should I wait the 18 months you mentioned?
</p>
<p>
A local skin clinic today has advised I should start skin needling quite soon, which will likely take 4-6 months to complete enough treatments.
</p>
<p>
Is it common have patients look the same as I did after galv?

sorry for not getting back to you sooner. The minor bit of pitting seen should resolve , completely, given enough time. I dont agree that you will need microneedling or anything like it. It&#39;s all a part of the normal healing process.Galvanic currents can produce large honey coloured scabs. the healing is progressive and what you see a few wees in is nothing compared to what you will see 8-9 months from now. Have a look at the 4 part series on the healing skin post electrolysis located here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viKQcBAHLOI&amp;list=PLeYuCaeN4D7PpsKYHFJ7tKr0yJoIyTSQO" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viKQcBAHLOI&amp;list=PLeYuCaeN4D7PpsKYHFJ7tKr0yJoIyTSQO
</a>
</p>
<p>
Take the time to understand it. The man who produces this video series is 40+ year experienced electrologist Michael Bono who is a published author on the Blend Method ( a highly regarded text on electrology)  and this series follows the skin healing over 18 months. The series is well produced and explains the processes at play during skin healing post electrolysis. He&#39;s also someone who I have relied on over the years to check in on cases of &#34;electrolysis caused scarring&#34; . Watch the video, and take the time to understand it, and that the principles presented apply equally across all modalities.  If the clinic is is recommending 6 weeks its because they are wanting to treat the next cycle of growth of hair in the timeline to establish full clearances within the cycle of hair growth. They arent concerned about the healing process , nor should they be as they will have experience in treating many faces before yours. Electrolysis caused scarring is extremely rare, and in all likelyhood no remediation including microneedling, will be required.

Go to Hairtell.com
</p>
<p>
Professional electrologists will give you an assessment. My skin did the same thing as yours though it took a year to show up. The collagen was destroyed and the pitting showed. Pissed me off  cuz my skin literally looked better when I shaved close than it does now. Electrolysis may eventually kill hair but it is quite damaging to the dermis and epidermis

I’d start using a healing ointment and a brightening spot treatment/creme serum on those dark spot? Or scar creme if so.

I think that might be marketing. Silicone gels and strips are the thing for scars.
