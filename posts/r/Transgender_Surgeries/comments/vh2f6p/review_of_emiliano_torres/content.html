<p>
I have noticed some girls posting in here wondering about the quality of Torres as an FFS surgeon, so I thought I would write about my experience.
</p>
<p>
I was his first international patient to come after covid restrictions lifted in Argentina. Prior to me arriving there, he and I were very much on the same page. However, once we consulted in person, he was pushing for procedures I didnâ€™t want. In particular, he wanted to give me a ski-slope sort of rhinoplasty thatâ€™s quite concave. I said no, and made it very clear that I didnâ€™t want that. I made it clear that I actually liked my nose as it was and didnâ€™t want it to be changed too much- just enough to kind of balance things out. I made this overly clear and checked in with him about this again after the consultation and before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
To my horror, when I came to after surgery, I found that he had not only violated my consent by giving me the exact nose I said I didnâ€™t want, he had also done so to an extreme degree by removing almost all of the tissue in my nose without it losing functionality.
</p>
<p>
I have been devastated by this. I have been left with a nose thatâ€™s pig-like and too upturned with a very unnatural dip in the middle of it. I canâ€™t handle taking photos of myself anymore, let alone looking in a mirror. These were issues I never had before.
</p>
<p>
To add insult to injury, Dr. Torres has taken no accountability for violating my consent and has decided to pursue a campaign of gaslighting me instead. He offers a free revision, but I would NEVER go under again with someone who lied and violated my consent the way he did. Not to add how inaccessible getting down to Argentina is.
</p>
<p>
Separate from that, he was surprisingly too conservative in his brow work, which is so odd because thatâ€™s where I made it clear I needed the most work done. He left asymmetries and bumps in my jaw. The fat he transferred to my cheeks didnâ€™t survive at all. And the hair transplants I did with him look awful- they traced my hairline rather than rounding it out like I asked and the hair transplants are far too thin and spread out and look ridiculous. He also lowered my hairline too much when I expressed that he didnâ€™t need to if I was getting hair transplants. The overly lowered hairline plus hair transplants have made my face look even more masculine on top of the pig nose he gave me.
</p>
<p>
All in all, Dr. Torres ruined my face. He has a small group of girls that rant and rave about how great he is as if they are in a cult. Dr. Torres himself is quite skilled at making girls feel at ease, heard, and prioritized in a way most other FFS surgeons donâ€™t. However, those qualities paired with a total disregard for a patientâ€™s consent is quite dangerous.

How awful for you. I am so sad to imagine the horrible dysphoria he has caused you.
</p>
<p>
What are you going to do?
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you feel you&#39;ll get no satisfaction from him, so what&#39;s next? A Go Fund Me account to fund the extensive revision you&#39;ll need? I will certainly contribute.
</p>
<p>
But more than that, what can you do to get justice?
</p>
<p>
Have you thought of going to ABC News here in this country to see if they&#39;d be willing to do a 20/20 piece on you?  (I&#39;ll bet they would.)
</p>
<p>
As a transwoman and a former television news exec, I think you have a compelling story to tell.
</p>
<p>
I might suggest talking to the other American networks as well--CBS and NBC--and BBC.
</p>
<p>
This man raped you. And yes, I mean that exact word: Rape.
</p>
<p>
He needs to be stopped, and he needs to be punished, and he needs to pay for your facial repair, altho that will likely never happen.
</p>
<p>
I hope you choose to tell your story on the national stage, and I wish you so much good luck and so many blessings.
</p>
<p>
If you decide to proceed, you will have to publish a before and after photo, and of course, I know how hard and humiliating that will be.
</p>
<p>
Again,  stay safe and proceed with your revision surgery before anything else. You need to get your face repaired.
</p>
<p>
First priority!!

I know that this is quite an old post, but I&#39;m going to him in January and I trust him to do exactly as I ask.

I actually also plan on going to him next year and so far most of the reviews and pics i&#39;ve seen of his work, some of them here, have actually looked very well done.
</p>
<p>
so after reading this i am a bit unsure.

Don&#39;t go on one review.  I&#39;m in a forum on FB where everyone has been to him, from many different countries and they all look fabulous, one girl even has a YouTube and 2 English girls I&#39;ve spoken to are on it. I&#39;m going in January, all booked and ready to go.
