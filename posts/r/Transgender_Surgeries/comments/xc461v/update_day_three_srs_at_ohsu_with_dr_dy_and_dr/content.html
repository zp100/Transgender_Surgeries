Your blood pressure is why you went deaf when you stood up. Your heart got used to pumping blood easier lying down and when you stood up, the blood decreased to your head for a moment. Uncomfortable, but normal. It happens to me all the time, I&#39;m prone to low BP.

I was going to see Dr. Dy for a follow up appointment to get Vaginoplasty after I had Vulvoplasty with Dr. Dugi, but the appointment got canceled and will have to wait again for some time to go for my vaginoplasty. I got my vulvoplasty October 2019 just before Covid started in March 2020. This was a big surgery for me because the only surgery I had was when I was a baby for bacterial meningitis as a 7 day old infant.
