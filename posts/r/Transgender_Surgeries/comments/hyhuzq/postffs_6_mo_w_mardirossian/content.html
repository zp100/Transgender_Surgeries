Hi, so I&#39;m at almost seven months post-op with forehead contouring, rhinoplasty, forehead advancement, cheek implants, jaw contouring, sliding genioplasty, and trachea shave with Dr. Mardirossian.
</p>
<p>
I want opinions on how everything looks. I still feel so ugly and un-passable all the time but I usually seem to pass somehow. I&#39;ll be getting a revision on my nose at the very least since there was an issue with some of the cartilage, but is there anything you would say to work on else wise?
</p>
<p>
Do I pass to you? Am I as ugly as I look to myself? I have a lot of trouble sorting reality from fiction when it comes to objectively viewing myself.
</p>

Hi there!
</p>
<p>
I do think that you pass although I would like to validate some of the issues you&#39;re seeing.
</p>
<p>
Your forehead is definitely flat and feminine but it doesn&#39;t look like you had much of a brow lift or orbital rim contouring. That really surprises me because I see a lot of really impressive forehead work coming from Dr. Mardirossian. Of course without before photos to compare with it&#39;s hard to say how aggressive he was. Was this a type III forehead surgery?
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;m very surprised to see that your nose looks the way it does. Mardirossian has a very characteristic cute barbie nose style and it doesn&#39;t look like he achieved that with you, or perhaps that&#39;s not what you were going for.
</p>
<p>
So, just to reiterate, you pass but I think maybe a revision brow lift in addition to revision rhinoplasty would go a long way. A CT scan would reveal if your orbital rims could be improved but some of us are just stuck with deep set eyes.
</p>
<p>
Edit: also wanted to add that getting your brows done might help, also.

Brow lift, he missed low
</p>
<p>
I did peek at your before pics and some features made this a difficult case.
</p>
<p>
Bluntly honest, you pass but lack much of what&#39;s considered beautiful by conventional standards.  Don&#39;t let that throw you off about passing.  Base that on how you&#39;re gendered differently now than pre ffs

You look good. If anything maybe a brow lift with a plastic surgeon. Your orbital rims are a bit droopy making you look older. I agree with the nose but don&#39;t overdo it. The rest are fine and makeup helps a lot too.

I was thinking of doing either a brow lift or blepharoplasty to correct that as it bothers me a lot too.

I do not unfortunately, he only sent the lower half.

Here is the album of my incredibly unflattering consultation photos:

There&#39;s definitely a lot of loose skin that needs dealing with above my eyes. I&#39;ll probably get a blepharoplasty or brow lift during my revision.

I don&#39;t think so? I feel he could have been more aggressive overall with his approach. And I think he did what he could with what I had.

I am 10 mo. post op, I had a consultation with Dr. mardirossian, but wanted something different with my chin other than his standard procedure so I went with a surgeon from out of state. .  At  7 months, more noticeable changes happened , so yeah, be patient. At one point I was so down on myself, I was going to de-transition (my SO is no help) but got my act together and pushed thru. Give it time and love yourself.

Consider a retinol cream especially for the forehead, and it can reduce the neck scar as well . This will soften the skin and lead to a more feminine appearance

If you want to do something practic different makeup techniques. Get your eyelashes and eyebrows done. Thats what all the other girls are doing. Try it and see what you think.

you&#39;re not ugly. you just need a brow lift and a new nose. your current nose is kind of big and masculine. Dr. M makes pretty noses. not sure what happened here. Did you ask him to be extremely conservative with your nose?

Well, you are attractive, so let’s get that over and done with.   From what I see you are androgynous right now.  SoI can see you passing quite a bit.  I think a brow lift would help to get them in a more typically feminine area.  An aggressive rhino is also going to do a lot.  Your lips could use some filler/fat, etc.  The other things are just grooming, eye brows, more body and/or curl to your hair if you are wearing it open, and I think you could benefit from a nice nude make-up look.   Hope this helps.
