My girlfriend went to Rumer. I saw the awful way Rumer treats her patients with my own two eyes. Even if Rumer was a good surgeon, the way she treats patients after surgery would be enough for me to warn people away.

Just for understanding this is an USA only list (except suporn/banks)?
</p>
<p>
Maybe also list it then, so other ppl from other countries that are seeing this information see where it comes from.

I really like how Avenassian is &#34;USE&#34; but Ting (the person who trained her to do SRS) is &#34;UNCERTAIN&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The few cases of displeasure of Ting has been either people who had uncontrolled diseases and blamed Ting for foreseeable consequences (uncontrolled diabetes getting bad nerve response &amp; getting necrosis) or people who went to him for FFS. I don&#39;t go to a Mexican restaurant and complain their cheeseburgers are bad. The biggest sin of Ting is he is
<em>
way
</em>
too popular and overblown for his skills. He is a good surgeon, but he isn&#39;t some fucking god and will never live up to that standard, just like every other surgeon on this list.
</p>
<p>
With that said: totally fair to rank in your own list, just my 2c.
</p>
<p>
Also, I don&#39;t go to surgeons for their political and philosophical opinions. Putting Bowers (a quite competent surgeon) in AVOID for simply not toeing the line is kind of absurd imo. She could surely fit into UNCERTAIN or her own category of &#34;EHHH&#34; since her latest work is wavering due to her age and imo, she is kind of overhyped, and overbooked... nearly 5 years last I heard, for the results she is giving. The results aren&#39;t bad, but afaik they are good &#34;last-gen&#34; results when compared to surgeons like Ting / Avenassian and Bluebond-Lagner.

Thank you. I wondered why Bowers was avoid. My first choice is Bank so having decided Bowers waiting list was to long and having had no response to my email enquiry she did not make my top 5 list.

If you started hrt early puberty like Jazz Jennings she’s appears to be very bad, and if you look at the complaints she’s had in general there’s a pattern to it.

which points to a wider set of concerns with ability as a surgeon  -  and  knowing when to say &#34;No,  you need to see a different  practitioner as I&#39;m not confident in my ability to provide  you  with the best care &#34;  - is a professional obligation of all  Health Professionals

It&#39;s a nice dream, but clearly not the reality for a lot of doctors, and not just surgeons.

it;s a professional requirement in many places around the world  and   could ( and should) be used against  Surgeons whose techniques are not up to scratch.

-Make the care of your patient your first concern.
<br>
- Provide a good standard of practice and care.
<br>
- Keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date.
<br>
-  Recognise and work within the limits of your competence.&#34;

I’ve never heard of any surgeon getting into trouble over their care, then there’s tons of really bad examples.

but unless people make a complaint to the  Registration authority   these Surgeons will be allowed  to continue providing care that des not measure up to the standards  required.

Awesome! I’m so glad and happy to hear that! Makes me much more optimistic and confident with this upcoming consult, thank you so much!

I’m scheduled with Bonnington in (gulp!) 7 days. Working with his staff has been positive, although it’s been mostly over email.

:) I&#39;ve got my primary ppt scheduled with him in just under 2 weeks and plan to share extensively. I am optimistic, obviously I choose to go with him so I better be and his aesthetics have only gotten better over the last year of really hammering cases.

Yeah I’ve seen he’s been getting better and better and it’s makes me more trustful and optimistic. Best of luck and I hope everything goes well and safely. I hope I too soon can be talking about being mere weeks out from finally being free.

I had a one-hour consult with Dr. Nikolavski of Upstate Urology in Syracuse, NY for an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
The appointment turned into 30 minutes of him preening about how wonderful a person he is for helping the poor, wretched, downtrodden trans people, plus 25 minutes of hard-sell to get him to do my vaginoplasty (thanks, but I&#39;m scheduled with Dr. Jun), and finally 5 minutes of discussing an orchiectomy. The staff, including their &#34;trans care coordination&#34; folks, have repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered me (despite a legal name change MONTHS ahead of time and updated gender markers on all my ID, they apparently saw my old name on a record somewhere and seem to prefer to use
<em>
that
</em>
name on the phone).
</p>
<p>
Having told me at our last appointment he could schedule me for the orchi as soon as he got my letters, I now have to take a day off work to travel halfway across the state for
<em>
another
</em>
appointment before I can be get scheduled.
</p>
<p>
Since I haven&#39;t had a procedure with him, I can&#39;t speak to his medical skills. I cannot say he&#39;s a bad surgeon.
</p>
<p>
But that&#39;s not what concerns me about him. The guy gives off the skeeviest of vibes, and I
<em>
dread
</em>
dealing with his staff. If other urologists in my area weren&#39;t booking out into March or April just for consults, I would drop him like a hot potato. As it stands, though, I think he&#39;s about my only chance for getting an orchi before summer.

Another one to add to the list, I had bottom surgery with Maurice Garcia at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles and I&#39;d say I came out with an average if disappointing exterior aesthetic but extremely good depth, function, sensation, and patient care. Also had a pretty miraculously minimal amount of pain from bith my surgeries with him (also had an orchi).

Move Brassard to the avoid list, he&#39;s been giving subpar aesthetic/functionality results for decades and used to(I don&#39;t know if this is still accurate) have his patients sign an NDA regarding their procedures with him.
</p>
<p>
The only reason he got so much business is that canadian fems had no choice but to go to him nationally if they wanted their surgery cost covered until recently, though most of us are still completely out of pocket if we want to use any providers out of country.

Are you kidding me?? This list is extremely damaging. Dr. Gast has very good results overall. There are some people who are extremely vocal about their (fair) dissatisfaction, but if that lands a surgeon on any avoid list there would be no surgeons to go to. So who do you believe? The happy patients or the unhappy ones? I understand this is your opinion list, but perhaps it would be best to keep it privately.

is this a MTF specific list? like, are we just talking about vaginoplasty? i see you mention vulva, and depth, so I assume so.

I’d add John Pang to the list of surgeons to use- I’ve had GCS and FFS with him and am happy with his work. No complications.

I would encourage a bit of hesitance with Dr Pang. I also had SRS with him and I am dissatisfied aesthetically and functionally, and seeking revision with other surgeons.

sure! you can also check my post history, i&#39;ve put in-depth records and photos up here before.
</p>
<p>
basically, it could be worse, but right now i feel extremely dissatisfied with the way things look, and i&#39;m unable to have penetrative sex at all because of internal scarring and stricture, it&#39;s hard to even get more than one finger in, i have problems with numbness (which i hope will resolve with more time), and i&#39;ve had recurrent bv and yeast infections almost constantly.

What&#39;s wrong with Freet? I&#39;ve seen at least one decent result from him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting my surgery with Ferrando in May, I&#39;m also wondering how else I can contribute to the knowledge about her. The information about her on the wiki has been incredibly helpful, although I can say some of it is inaccurate (namely, I had heard she trained with Bowers, but when I asked her she clarified she had merely attended one training session with Bowers, and had done more extensive training with Leis and later Brassard).
