TLDR:
</p>
<p>
forehead, nose, eye, chin with Dr Anna Sluzky in Armenia, she&#39;s very good at achieving the result laid out in the planning process and she&#39;s able to do subtle or aggressive, or a mixture to achieve the result you&#39;re after.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Hey Everyone!
</p>
<p>
Previous post regarding FFS Here:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/111sv0j/upcoming_ffs_passing_confusion/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/111sv0j/upcoming_ffs_passing_confusion/</a>
</p>
<p>
So here&#39;s my new face. I&#39;m still growing into it. Total honesty, even with a good FFS result, post surgical depression can still occur, and it can hit really hard. Anyone considering surgery of any kind should brace themselves for it.
</p>
<p>
Choosing my surgeon and the final procedures was very difficult for me, as cost was one restricting factor, and I work as a performer and a model, so my face was extremely important to me. On one hand I was battling dysphoria, on the other hand I knew the facial features I had were also a unique selling point for me and allowed me to stand out as a model.  However the negative attention I drew in my daily life was too much to handle. A complicated situation to say the least, but one I had been tumbling around in for a few years while saving up funds, and I was ready for it to be over.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, mental health, social and work issues aside, Anna is a very good surgeon, she didn&#39;t try to upsell me on anything, in fact she tried to talk me out of having my nose hump removed, and I really have to give credit to surgeons who don&#39;t believe in beauty trends, and don&#39;t try to force them upon their patients.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
On to procedures:
</p>
<p>
-Forehead type 3, with brow lift, orbital rim shave and temporal fossa reduction.
</p>
<p>
-Custom forehead implant to augment the slope.
</p>
<p>
-Rhinoplasty, Septoplasty for a breathing issue
</p>
<p>
-Canthoplasty
</p>
<p>
-Chin shave (very subtle to improve front-on symmetry and remove some of the downward slope it had, that I felt lengthened that portion of my face too much.)
</p>
<p>
At 6 weeks now, I still have some swelling in the Chin and my nose won&#39;t take its final shape till around the 1 year mark. So it will be some time before I settle in to this face properly and some time before I recognise if I want anything revised, or any additional procedures, if anything at all. I feel happiness for this face that I now have, the softness I wanted has been granted. Anna is incredibly good at achieving the result her and the patient set out to achieve.
</p>
<p>
My old face was very beautiful and I can&#39;t help but feel a sense of loss in some ways, but I do notice alot less negative attention in my daily life now. So...i guess i&#39;m passing now?
</p>
<p>
I do feel that maybe a hair transplant would help to &#34;finish off&#34; my new face and bring more balance to these features. I will address that when I&#39;m a few more months down the line.
</p>
<p>
Complications: None during surgery only a minor one during recovery. I gave myself a small air bubble in my forehead by blowing air out of my nose too hard while syringing my nose each day. (Sorry not sorry I just wanted those boogers out of my nose, can&#39;t blame me I haven&#39;t breathed properly in like 7 years!)
</p>
<p>
Be aware that this can cause an air bubble to form. It usually dissipates on its own in my case, it went away in 1 week. Anna was helpful with care on this matter. I just had to bandage my forehead a little tight for a little longer.
</p>
<p>
Location:
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery with Anna in Yerevan in Armenia, I flew from the UK via Paris, the flight there and back wasn&#39;t too much of a hassle, though I couldn&#39;t really clean my nose properly with my saline spray until I arrived home due to liquid restrictions. This could have been resolved with a salt sachet and a small syringe and cup, but I didn&#39;t plan ahead for that.
</p>
<p>
I spent most of my time in Armenia indoors, there were a few other trans women going for surgery there too, and it was nice to spend some time with them.
</p>
<p>
Armenia is a conservative country, but I was fine being 6&#39;3 walking around showing midriff in an emerald green velour tracksuit the few times I did leave the room. I have heard other not so pleasant stories, so ymmv, but I was fine. If you can blend in, it&#39;s probably safer to do so. I was also with my cis-male partner and my mother so that may have helped my safety.
</p>
<p>
The hospital staff, and nurses were very caring, they took no more than 5 minutes to arrive each time they were called throughout the night during my stay.
</p>
<p>
Followup care, bandage changes etc. was all taken care of by Anna and then her assistant who specialises in noses, Up until day 10.
</p>
<p>
This is a mess lol. I can&#39;t write reviews for the life of me. If you have questions feel free to ask. x

<p>
Wait period in my case was about 1.5 months, usually she visits Armenia every 1.5…2 months, so, highly likely you can get to the next one.

Two questions:
</p>
<p>
1) What kind of incision does she do?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
2) She seems to use forehead implants quite often—what is the point of this?

She can do either incision though I believe her preference is coronal incision. We opted for coronal approach so as not to leave a scar on my forehead, and she believed a good result for my hairline/forehead size situation, could be achieved with hair transplants alone.
</p>
<p>
The implant was optional. In profile I was bothered by my forehead slope angle, she didn&#39;t use it on other girls who went at the same time as me, I think she just has a good knowledge for the application and use of custom implants, so chooses to use them in her arsenal, where other doctors may not due to preference or different training. I know others opt for bone cement. Both have pros and cons.
</p>
<p>
We could have done this without the implant, but ultimately I decided to go for it.

did she do simultaneous hair transplant like FT? or did she just discard the strip of skin with hair follicles when performing the surgery

No she doesn&#39;t offer hair transplant. Usually more grafts survive if done months after surgery anyway.
</p>
<p>
I honestly don&#39;t think she tool a strip of skin for coronal incision. I have the video. She made an incision, did her thing, then stitched it back up. She creates a random incision made of multiple cuts. In her words &#34;So when the wind blows it will not look like one big scar&#34;, easier to conceal. The stitching was very neat.

Interesting! Is there not excess skin? Or is that filled in by the implant?

You look absolutely incredible OP 🤩 you had modelesque features before, and Anna did a great job at enhancing your features!
</p>
<p>
Your forehead is my literal goals! We have similar sized foreheads, and was thinking of doing the hairline lowering, but I love not having to worry about a scar like you said.
</p>
<p>
I’d like to hear more about why you chose the implant over cement? She’s the first surgeon outside of Asia that’s offered an implant and I’d like to weigh out the pros and cons of choosing that 😅

Yep frontoplasty is forehead. There are two rhinoplasties. The more expensive one is for septum repair too. Genioplasty cost is only for sliding. I only had a chin shave so it was the cheaper one. Costs are all inclusive of hospital and anaesthesia.

Yes she is a gem. We need to make sure she prospers, especially in her current precarious situation having fled her home country. She actually cares, she must be protected.

Any idea why it’s so cheap? She seems like the second best in/around Europe but like 1/10 the price of FT

I mean perhaps Russian hospital/clinic costs were lower than other areas of Europe? I&#39;m not sure tbh.
</p>
<p>
FT IMO are like a designer brand of FFS at this point, you&#39;re paying for the label, not necessarily a better product. They have a stay package and other perks too of course, and perhaps more stability in terms of being permanently based in the same location if you have to go back, but I believe alot of their pricing comes from all of the above plus their marketing, high profile and established reputation. Take away their esteem, and they have no business charging what they do. This is not to say their work is bad. Not at all. But there are many clinics who do work to the same standard or higher who charge far more reasonable prices. I believe some of that pricing is to do with fame of the clinic.

She said I healed really well...all my bruising was gone by day 9.
</p>
<p>
Idk if it helped, but I have an LED and near infra-red light therapy panel that&#39;s fda rated, its meant to help with healing, and I use it religiously, plus ice, rest, vitamins, etc...
</p>
<p>
There is definitely still swelling around my chin and nose. Micro swelling all over too, but this just appears as a subtle difference in skin texture/appearance.. kinda looks nice tbh, pores are gone...for now Bahaha
</p>
<p>
I have alot of numbness in the chin around my incision, nose has some feeling, but not much when I touch it, forehead has decent sensation, head is quite numb on and further back from the incision site. In front of the incision it has ok sensation though.
