Fat injections to the cheeks offer a permanent solution; you don’t need “implants.” The forehead can absolutely be revised, probably with some bone fillers. The scar could be improved at the same time. I personally think your jaw and chin are fine, but your forehead IMO does need to be corrected as there appears to be considerable unevenness.

Cheek fillers are not permanent. I have implants AND had fat grafts twice and the absolutely reabsorb after some time, though not fully.

Fat grafting is considered permanent. It’s not a “filler” in the traditional sense. Not all the fat survives but at least some should. In fact that can be a drawback because if placed badly fat does NOT dissolve and can become lumpy. This information is freely available to anyone and is not a matter of opinion.

Did you edit your message? Thought you called it cheek filler. And yea, I know how it works fam, had it done twice. I consistently got hollowing on the right side of my face after 2 times (probs from sleeping on it if I had to guess). It&#39;s not that noticable but does affect profile a little. Most of the fat reabsorbs and only a small amount actually stays. That&#39;s why you&#39;re not supposed to mess with it or it wont bond appropriately. I would call fat grafts semi-permanent.

I’m afraid you’re mistaken; I didn’t edit anything. My doctor called it permanent, as does the literature. I’ve seen pretty good examples of it lasting 10 years or longer. Perhaps you just didn’t have very good luck.

You look beautiful. As others have said, it&#39;s very nit picky and I get your concerns, but for my quick glance I&#39;d say it&#39;s not worth the bother.

You can work on the scar by having hair transplanted

Same opinion. I didn’t notice until she pointed it out. I see what she means by the hairline scar and it’s not that big a deal but like you said if it bothers her enough to fix it then go for it. I was unable to see what she was pointing out about the rest, it looks just fine to me.

You’re gorgeous! I think doing what makes you most comfortable is the right decision. If you’re bothered, get the fixes. If you can live without them, don’t. You look amazing to me, but how YOU feel is most important.

I&#39;m not a surgery expert but I did want to say that your concerns make sense, you&#39;re all good on that front. When I say they make sense I mean I get what you&#39;re pointing out, but personally I don&#39;t think it&#39;s super necessary. It&#39;s not my place to try and stop you, nor would I want to intervene in that way, but I do want to say I think you look great, and regardless of what you do you&#39;ll probably still look great :)

If you are bothered that is all that is needed to move forward. However, you look wonderful and imperfections makes you more credible

I think some fine tuning would help.  I see front on in the first pic your hairline is off.   Probably you do not wear your hair like that.  So I don’t know if that is something worth tampering with.
</p>
<p>
Your forehead could be smoothed either by someone good with bone paste or fat/fillers.  A subtle brow lift would help as well.  Also light filler work around nasiolabial folds.  Your lower face is spot on and love your graceful neck.😍

I&#39;ve seen incredible difference with medical tattooing over a scar for a face-lift and the scar was completely invisible after!

Cheeks would just be implants, if you want a ‘permanent’ solution (compared to injections). Maybe mandible, but it would change your face shape a lot

You really look great, if I would do anything, I agree with you on the forehead, I would consider a brow bone reduction if your skull allows it without getting involvement  into the frontal sinus,  it would correct the forehead scar, probably advance your hairline a little.  All that work would be in one area decreasing surgical costs.  For the best results I would consult with
<a href="https://deschamps-braly.com" rel="nofollow">https://deschamps-braly.com
</a>
in San Francisco.   Probably would not consider implants, a fat grafting would add to cheek fat and I would get PRP and and ADSC with the transfer to increase graft survival.  Not sure how to private message you, but if you figure it out, I will talk privately with you.
