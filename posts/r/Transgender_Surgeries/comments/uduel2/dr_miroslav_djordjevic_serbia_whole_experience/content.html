Long text but here is all about my personal experience with Miro, his team, my recovery... answering all the questions I got asked! xx pictures are in a previous post I made
</p>
<p>
-
</p>
<p>
<strong>
How did I choose the technique and surgeon
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have psoriasis, so I wanted to avoid putting skin inside my vaginal canal. I had to choose a technique that could require a canal that wasn’t at risk of developing psoriasis. My first choice was Dr. Décio in Lisbon, Portugal. A friend of mine went there and she wasn’t fully satisfied with the results and mostly with the post op care from the hospital and the doctor (I won’t go into details). I tried contacting Dr. Littleton in Brazil because they both have the canal made with the jejune but I had no answer.
</p>
<p>
I started looking for other techniques and it boiled down to sigmoid colon (SG) or peritoneal pull through (PPT). Both seemed good and I started my quest for surgeons that had good results, that were available and that did the PPT. In my long research I found
<strong>
Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic
</strong>
in Serbia. He seemed to have a lot of experience. I emailed him and I got a very quick response and was invited to do a video call with him. I could almost say that I was sold after this first FaceTime call. He seemed very knowledgeable and ready for this conversation and also extremely kind and securing. I felt very safe. We discussed broadly and commented on my skin condition in order to find a solution to it. With PPT and SG there’s always the need to add a bit of skin for the entrance, PPT seemed to need around 10cm while SG required only 3 to 5 cm. This seemed great to me. Any easily accessed skin was less of a risk and as well, being a moisturized environment (all vulvas are), my dermatologist had said the risk was less. I had multiple calls with him and he also referred me to his colleagues for more medical details.
</p>
<p>
Still unsure because of all the myths around SC, I mentioned them to him and he
<strong>
busted all the myths of sigmoid colon
</strong>
. He explained that the overgrowth of discharge comes from using too much of a graft of SC and that, to avoid that, he only uses a 10cm graft. As well he said that the colon is so flexible that it can double its size so it would not be any problem of depth. It would only depend on my anatomy. The fear of the smell also was something he said its common the first few months because the graft is used to have a complete different function, and therefore now it will require some time to adapt. As well I had the experience of one of my closest sisters. She had SC 10 years ago and her experience with the colon vaginoplasty seemed perfect, so that really was the deal maker for me.
</p>
<p>
After a month I was ready to say yes to him. The whole team helped me get ready for it. They sent the medical requirements I had to send beforehand and Marta, the doctor assistant, helped me organize the whole trip. I was being picked up from the airport, they had book an apartment for me, and I would be driven back and forth from the house to the hospital. The price included the stay, the home etc. I had nothing to worry (go to the end of the post to find out what I advice on bringing with you for the trip).
<strong>
The price was 23.500 all inclusive
</strong>
. I discussed with them that I was paying it myself and no insurance would cover it, I advice you to do the same they might be able to do something about it. My surgery was scheduled two months after I said yes. They could have done it only a month after I said yes, but I had a lot to plan for work and I needed the extra time.
</p>
<p>
Also,
<strong>
he showed me some pictures of surgeries right after it was done
</strong>
, it was great to see them but they don’t really show the reality of a healed vulva 1 or 2 years after. I still thought everything looked gorgeous. The few pictures I had seen were through Reddit. Still, the way he did it was very convincing and it gave me confidence, I trusted him and I do not regret it at all!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Arriving to Serbia and pre op.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I arrived to Serbia a couple of days before the due date. They had planned for me to meet with the surgeon, see the hospital and get settled in the apartment. I was picked up in the airport without an issue and brought to the apartment. I went to the hospital when the doctor was available and they did a general blood test, covid test, ekg and some other stuff. Then I met the surgeon assistant, Marta, who helps you prepare for the trip. She was super kind and explained to me with detail what the surgery consisted on, how I was expected to feel before, all the preparation needed (SC requires a colon cleaning so you’re brought into the hospital the day before the surgery and given a laxative drink all day). They warned me that, because my gut would be put asleep, I would have a tube coming from my stomach all the way out through my nose to keep the fluids going out upwards. This would help with vomiting (in theory). I would stay in bed for the first day after surgery and slowly start taking small steps. The hospital was very small but well equipped. They delayed my surgery for one day because the day I had planned was festive and the surgeon wanted to make sure all services were available in case they were needed. I thought it was a good idea.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards I met Miro in person, he was extremely kind and confident. I really appreciated that on him. He asked me also what did I want when it came to aesthetic choices.
<strong>
I chose to have big labia minora and majora as well as a good sized clitoris
</strong>
. It’s always easier to take out than to put back. He also wanted to meet my parents, the meeting was short but reassuring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hormones
</strong>
. They required me to stop all hormones for 2 weeks. I managed to lower it to 1 week. I do not think this is necessary nowadays and even less when taking EV injections, but I did follow their guidelines (beware of intense night sweats after starting hormones again, hormonal misbalance is big!!)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery post op, first days
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Surgery was early morning and scheduled to last 7h, in the end it took 10h more or less because he had some issues with finding the space for my vaginal canal. Nothing wrong happened, but I was asleep longer than expected. When I woke up my family could come visit me for only 10 minutes, but I was glad. I wasn’t feeling good at all. Day by day they were able to come more often. I woke up with an urethral and anal catheter, with another tube coming out of my stomach and the tube coming out of my nose. When I tell you this was the worst feeling I had I am not exaggerating. I have nausea very easy and this tube could be felt all through my throat, the nose… It wasn’t only an awful feeling I almost wanted to die. I felt tortured, kept asking myself why did I do this… The tube had to be there until my gut woke up, that took 48h. Bear with it if you go for SC, its really the worst, but I hope you can handle it better than me. I felt tortured, I couldn’t move at all without having nausea and throwing up, and the vomiting would make the nausea worst because it would move the tube. Throughout all this, I had the BEST care from the nurses, they were super sweet, caring, attentive… never felt I was of inconvenience for them. They really were here for me. The nurse that took care of me on day 1 called on day 2 to see if I was better, if the tube had been removed and, if so, if I was smiling already as I promised her. I still get emotional thinking of her, they really were little angels helping me. Once the tube was removed I felt the biggest relief of the world! I cried of joy. I never really had intense pain, tho I was dosed properly with painkillers (no morphine). From here onwards the recovery for the following 10 days went steady. Small walks to get back in track with my energy, every day a bit more… food was slowly reintroduced (water first, then tea, then biscuits, then something soft…). I had a strict diet for 5 weeks. It mostly consisted of no spicy food, no chocolate, no beans, no raw food… They will give you the whole list. It’s a bit boring but you can endure it!
</p>
<p>
I had a
<strong>
small
</strong>
<strong>
complication
</strong>
. The surgery was laparoscopic and I had 3 small incisions and one larger one in the stomach area. The 2nd or 3rd day back home the big incision got infected (I think because of the night sweats). It was a big but superficial infection. I was given extra antibiotics right away and they emptied the area and disinfected. This was really really painful. They also put a small drain to make sure the infection wouldn’t be closed inside and the wound would drain nicely. The infection slowly went away and the issue was solved. They removed the packing to check that there wasn’t any infection in the vaginal canal. Once they saw it was all good they placed some fresh packing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
days 10 to 30
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Around day 11 or so I started dilations and I got the catheter removed. The removal of the catheter was uncomfortable but at this point the catheter was very uncomfortable. I developed a UTI because of the friction and inflammation caused by the catheter, but it is normal. (Form the day of the removal I had special antibiotics for UTIs). They also removed the packing and they taught me how to dilate. This was a very scary feeling, of course, there’s a lot of new feelings and nothing is pleasurable, its new and i was laughing nervously, but it wasn’t painful luckily. They gave me the dilators and showed me how it had to be done, where my vaginal canal was etc I was told to start dilating with my finger and then go upsizing with time every couple weeks (they will explain everything to you). Once the catheter was removed you need to pee as soon as possible. I peed that same hour in the clinic, I wasn’t sure if I had peed, everything was so confusing, but I actually did. The following days I had horrible UTI symptoms and going to the bathroom was super difficult. It was very comfortable to not have tubes anymore coming out of me but the UTI was really the 2nd worst part of the whole surgery. This took a couple weeks to balance itself out. Probably around a month until I stopped having issues peeing. My tips are:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Drink a lot of water
</li>
<li>
Try to train your bladder to hold pee so, even if you need to pee every 20 minutes, try to hold it at least once an hour and then every 2 hours etc
</li>
<li>
To aid peeing I found different tricks worked, sometimes one worked sometimes it had to be other. Mostly hot water on my belly and vulva would help peeing, turning the light off, touching some water… use google to find all the possible tips and find the ones that works best for you.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After a couple of days it was ‘ok’, more under control. The other issue was bowel movement not being as it was before. This takes a long time, bare with your body! Let it heal slowly.
</p>
<p>
Walking was difficult for the first month, and sitting down even worst. When they say buy a donut pillow, do it. I didn’t do it and I regret it because I had a lot of uncomfortable sitting! Use it! This was more or less uneventful, except some stitches got infected at the top of the vulva (this was only the size of a pimple) but this was entirely my fault, I had used some moisturized above in my pubic area and it went too down. Be weary of oils and moisturizers. Wounds need to be dry to heal nicely and avoid getting infected.
</p>
<p>
Some stitches were uncomfortable or keeping an open wound, I was advised to remove maybe a couple of individual stitches at my family doctor (I asked them first).
</p>
<p>
Dilation was all in schedule and working fine! Going sizes up was hard to do but never really painful. You just must listen to your body and go slowly when you’re ready. After dilation once I had a huge blood clot that was sitting in my vaginal canal falling out, that was funny and gross and also completely normal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
30 to 90 days
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is going to be more of a bullet point list of the things that have been going on. A few scares here and there but that meant nothing (like a bit of blood here, a strange feeling there etc)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sensitivity is very different depending on the area. There are some areas that have very few nerve endings because of the scars and it’s expected to have less sensation in those areas, as with any scar. I have sensitivity inside (see next bullet point) as well as outside.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Sex
</strong>
. So far I only had penetrative sex once. I am not used at all to movements and the penis was bigger than any of my dilators. We used
<strong>
OHNUT
</strong>
<strong>
protector rings
</strong>
. I really advice getting these. They’re silicone rings for the penis to avoid penetrating too deep. It makes it easier for the person penetrating to know when to stop, gives them pleasure as well. This will of course get better with time. I had a lot of pleasure from the canal (as well as a bit of too much pressure at times because of the size). I was surprised at how much feeling i got from penetration, I sobbed when we finished because it felt incredible that this happened.
</li>
<li>
People keep bringing up the
<strong>
natural lubrication vs no lubrication
</strong>
. Any vaginal canal is a humid place and every vagina will need extra lubrication for safe penetration. I would never have any sex without adding lube. This, in my opinion, is not a reason to choose PPT, SC or PI.
</li>
<li>
At this point I have a lot of discharge coming down every couple days. This is normal since its been less than 3 months, the SC still thinks it needs to pass stool by. Soon I will start antibiotics to get rid of the overgrowth of the specific bacteria that is causing this, but its not an infection and its not dangerous (no fever, pain, night sweats…). The discharge is smelly but most girls I’ve spoken with that had SC say that it wasn’t forever and it goes away. I don’t need to use panty liners every day anymore. I got the hang on how to remove the discharge after dilation and there’s virtually almost no risk of staining my panties much. It sometimes happens but that’s fine, not a big deal.
</li>
<li>
The depth of my graft was around 5 inches and so far I am approaching 8 inches of depth. Muscles are getting used to having a canal there and the depth is expanding.
</li>
<li>
I have orgasms since the second month, sometimes there’s some blood. It’s very different to play with one’s self with a whole new set of genitals but it can be very exciting and frustrating at times. But I have no issues having orgasms.
</li>
<li>
Scars are mostly healed on a superficial level, no stitches at all. It might be that some stitches resurface from the inside later on (up to 9 months that they can take to be reabsorbed). I recently had a stitch resurface in the inside of my canal. I might get it removed but I haven’t decided. This is normal
</li>
<li>
I haven’t had sex and only plan on trying in the next couple weeks. I expect it to be easier than dilation since the penis can be flexible and its adapting more than the dilator.
</li>
<li>
All the scars are still quite darkened but this can take up to a year for them to fade, there’s almost no texture in them.
</li>
<li>
I dilate twice a day, tho sometimes I just can’t handle it and skip a session. Minimum I do once a day. At the one year point they allow you to do less often.
</li>
<li>
My canal does have sensation, I don’t know how pleasurable it will be when having sex, but I know it has enough nerve endings to feel everything, its similar to anal sex.
</li>
<li>
After all this time, Marta and Miro are very available for any questions, concerns, fears… that I have. The post op care from their side is incredible and really available.
</li>
<li>
The aesthetics are great at this point. I love the appearance of my vulva. I would only consider retouching my clitoris hood for it to be a bit more hidden (it can get uncomfortable when exposed). Other than that I love my vulva.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
What I advice you take for the surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Most of the things you will need you can either get them there or you will get them from the hospital, but there was a few things I was struggling to actually find.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I would advice to buy and bring
<strong>
KY lube
</strong>
or any other thick water based lube. A few of them! I would say 2 or 3 for a couple weeks. But better not to be short. I couldn’t really find a lube that I liked in Belgrade, they were all too slippery and you need a thick water based lube to really help with everything gliding and covering the dilator.
</li>
<li>
A hand mirror. The house had one but I made sure to have my own hand mirror.
</li>
<li>
Many pijamas and extra underwear and t-shirts. I was sweating a lot for a few days having such intense night sweats that I had to change my pijamas a few times some days during the night. Make sure you bring enough clothes to handle this. As well as extra underwear and only cotton underwear and preferably black/dark that wont really get stained.
</li>
<li>
You are going to spend 2 weeks at home, you don’t really need outwear clothes so much, just maybe sweatpants, but mostly you need things to make you feel comfortable at home.
</li>
<li>
Take from Serbia to your country if you can saline solution that they give you. It can help you to be secured until you find it at your place. Otherwise,
<strong>
try to get saline solution before going and stock some
</strong>
at your place. This is an investment if your insurance doesn’t cover this kind of product. You can expect maybe even 1k extra. The same with lube. I am 3 months post surgery and probably have used 20-25 bottles of KY lube.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
xx hope this is enough for you girls to make some decisions!

Thank you for sharing. I&#39;m considering going with Dr. Djordjevic too so that&#39;s all really interesting. Can I ask about hair removal? Did you have to get laser or electro in that area beforehand?

no laser required because it wasn’t penile inversion, only a small part of the skin was in and he chose a hairless one

Just a truly amazing write up, THANK YOU. I totally forgot to send you questions, but you really covered everything!
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me what do you mean with &#34;anal catether&#34;? I don&#39;t think I have ever heard of that (or the tube throught the nose), wow, it sounds like a tough few days after surgery. To have so many tubes, it scares me!

How is your bowel movement now? Is it back to normal? Also some who had SC SRS reported having a bulge in the stomach, did you experience that?

I met him in person and the whole time he yelled at me to loose weight. I went to talk about meta and phallo. He ended up ghosting my second appointment and I&#39;ve heard nothing since then. He really shamed me and said loosing weight was easy for him. I&#39;m glad you had a better conversation with him.

oh that’s awful. Yeah BMI is a big excuse for surgeons to be fatphobic. Unfortunately it’s not easy to find doctors that don’t pull the stupid rule of ‘you need to be at certain weight to have surgery’. I hope you find the one, you don’t deserve to not have your gender confirming surgeries

My problem might be being too thin, so I really need to gain weight before doing the surgery, everyhting you wrote sounds like it might make you lose even more weight, especially the strict diet for 5 weeks, wow!

Was there ever a discussion about doing your SC with the open method, or was it always gonna be Larasopic way?

For what it&#39;s worth, a few things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dr. Djordjevic no longer uses an NG tube or an anal catheter for this surgery! Making this
<em>
way
</em>
easier than it used to be
</li>
<li>
I cannot recommend enough getting a bottle of D-Mannose pills and take them
<em>
constantly
</em>
(i.e. every meal and bedtime). It will keep the UTIs away.

Thank you for sharing your experience! I wanted to know if you would be willing to share his email? I wanted to reach out to see if I could be a candidate for a penile transplant for transgender men.

No offense but looks like a paid AD. I have seen his work in the past (few months ago) results are mixed and while some are good, some are terrible. If you are choosing him you might also choose any UK or USA doctor

You read this and thought this was someone writing a paid advertisement?

<blockquote>
<p>
I woke up with an urethral and anal catheter, with another tube coming out of my stomach and the tube coming out of my nose. When I tell you this was the worst feeling I had I am not exaggerating. I have nausea very easy and this tube could be felt all through my throat, the nose… It wasn’t only an awful feeling I almost wanted to die.

One more question; are you able to eat all types of food now? Some who had SC surgery say they can&#39;t digest some types of food anymore, greasy.etc

I know this post is old, but I hope you will reply to me. I have to have a revision with a sigmoid colon, since I had a first operation which however had the complication of vaginal stenosis, I only have 10 cm of depth and the vagina is so narrow as to prevent sexual intercourse. I&#39;m scared reading your review.... I hope I can make it and not die
