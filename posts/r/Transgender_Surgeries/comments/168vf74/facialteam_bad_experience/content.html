I like that you write about your experience. And this should also be respected here. My experience wasn&#39;t the best either and didn&#39;t have surgery at FT. I feel that FT feels like they are gods, which I don&#39;t think is true. I also think they are overpriced.

I don&#39;t understand that at all. I think EVERY EXPERIENCE MUST BE RESPECTED. Especially here on Reddit. All experiences are important to us. And I find it totally incomprehensible that comments are made here and diagnoses are made! The fact that your breathing is not even mentioned shows that they are strange people! instead they write that it&#39;s up to you (it&#39;s always all dysphoria, what.) I feel that if you are struggling with your breathing, I find it irresponsible of FT to let you down like this! And please don&#39;t delete the post!

Ive read plenty of times and have people who had FT state that their nose work wasnt that good (one was considering a revision another one said it wasnt up to par).
</p>
<p>
People still just keep doing it with them though for some reason, for 11k euros they charge you can get some world class specialists who only do noses elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Note : Im not saying they suck at it. Just that its below par with the price and quality you would expect from their brow bone work for example.
</p>
<p>
I personally would be very angry if my nose had that result.  Money is so hard to come by for us without good insurance and each nosejob revision puts you close and closer to michael jackon level nose.

I had an awful experience consulting with FacialTeam. I&#39;m forgetting his name but he was very unprofessional at points of my consult. He seemed to imply I was ugly as &#34;this surgery will not make you prettier&#34; like yea thanks dude, I know I look like shit on Zoom, good judgement call. The worst part was when I cited a before and after example from their site of one girl who&#39;s results I really liked and some of her features seemed similar to the ones I struggle with and his response was &#34;ah yea, I love that bitch.&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe it.
</p>
<p>
That said in all your pictures you look great and not even slightly male. I don&#39;t discredit the issues they may have caused with your nose either, that is incredibly unprofessional to not follow up. It&#39;s unfirtunate but you might need a revision with another more trusted surgeon.

I&#39;m surprised you did the forehead and nose reduction. They looked ok in pre surgery photo to me. Well within female ranges.
</p>
<p>
Overly flat foreheads arent attractive unless you have the verticality to go with it.

Is there a reason they didn&#39;t go deeper around your radix? That&#39;s what you&#39;re not telling us. : ]
</p>
<p>
Am curious to know what they said, given everything is a decision someone makes etc...
</p>
<p>
The alternative, if they can&#39;t go deeper, is to add projection above it, though not to the extent of a brow bone. It&#39;s more the shape than projection that makes something feminine, as you&#39;ve pointed out in the photos from the book.
</p>
<p>
Who were your surgeons?

Well, going by that, it sounds like they acknowledged something of a failing. Maybe that&#39;s what you need to focus on to reach the desired outcome?

Please choose someone else for your revision. They&#39;re Just not good at doing nosejobs .. search an Expert in Turkey.. it&#39;s not bad anyway and they were right about your hairline..you dont Need It lowered... But they never do hairline advancements and It really sucks

Well, whatever you decide, I advise you don&#39;t burn your bridges with them.
</p>
<p>
Regarding your hairline, I&#39;m not trying to offend you - it is perfect. I agree with the sentiment here that attempting to lower it would be a mistake and throw off your facial thirds. Your friends might be responding under duress.

I was with Dr Gutierrez too and I specifically spoke to him about the radix and it needing to be set back a little compared with the virtual FFS mockups. He agreed to do it and I’m happy with the outcome. I know some people want the continuous slope look and are very angry when they don’t get it. So was it something you spoke about before and how does your result compare with the mockups?

Thank you for sharing your sentiments, we regret to hear your disappointment as our goal is for patients to feel complete security, on all levels. Constructive criticism is welcome in order to maintain the quality our patients expect. For this purpose, Facialteam staff consistently provides professional care via specific two-way channels where confidential details may be discussed (phone, email, video). Data Protection Law prohibits discussing private medical information on social media.
</p>
<p>
Please allow us to share that our care protocols are the product of 13 years in which Facialteam has operated on more than 2500 patients from all over the world, with a dedicated team of humans who, wanting to make a difference, have also played an important role outside the operating theatre: expanding on WPATH&#39;s best practices in FFS, training programs for international professionals, plus research and development of Facial Feminization surgery methods and care.
</p>
<p>
Yet Facialteam does not claim to be perfect.
</p>
<p>
Learning from this long experience is precisely what has informed the protocol that insists all parties sustain objective communications if any issues arise, such as refrain from false accusations or threats. Persistent violations of the respect and trust required for discussion will deteriorate the relationship, hamper our ability to provide attention or potentially result in the termination of communications. Thanks for understanding and we remain at your service.

FT are notoriously bad for nose jobs, they always do a tiny pixie nose that looks hard to breathe out of and is beyond &#34;normal&#34; noses straight into looking like an obviously nose jobbed nose. No one should get their nose done with FT

A lot of this really looks like body dysmorphia tbh, ur hairline is extremely low, why would u want it lower? I cant really see an Adams Apple in the picture, 1 or 2 mm can often be enough. I think the results are really pretty.

They were right not to lower your hairline. It would like ape-ish and throw off the proportions of your face. It looks like you still have swelling in the area of the radix. Perhaps it ought to be reduced further but the nose already looks kind of nose-jobby. Feminine but nose-jobby. I think it’s the slope and the pointiness.
</p>
<p>
As for the forehead bump I went to a different doctor and had that too. I think it has to do with the muscles readjusting to their new positions.  Botox helped.

I’m confused about what your current problems are, especially you mentioning the hair line lowering they didn’t want to do: your hair line is extremely low already, as far removed from cis male as could be, lowering it further would cause you to fall into the uncanny valley.
</p>
<p>
As for the nose it looks like a perfectly average nose?
</p>
<p>
The ‘bed side manner’ problems seem the most serious ones to me? Not getting a follow up, being misgendered are all problematic.
</p>
<p>
The scar tissue is an unfortunate risk of any surgery, so not exactly avoidable, because it can and will happen with the best of care.
</p>
<p>
But your face in general looks perfectly fine, not masculine, not ‘alien like’.

I had a consultation with them, but their proposals didn’t convince me. they said I just need for head and nose and turned  that I need to facelift and chin and everything so I didn’t know what they were seeing.

I think you have fallen down a slippery slope of being overly self critical. You look 100% female to me and that is the goal of FFS. I think your problems are much more psychological than physiological. In other words: your self esteem needs to improve or nothing will.

I have a question...did they asked you how you wanted things to be done? They made simulations? Because i had similar experience with Baez Marquez.. i had to show my own virtual modifications in my smartphone .. i dont have bumps but i think that this way One looses faith in the surgeon... I asked for a certain nose angle (as you) but i told them that If It wasnt possible they could do in different way...i was very open to possible outcomes.. anyway you look good.. Surgeons often sucks.. i suggest you to Enjoy your new very FEMALE face and when you have Money and time you get a revision from an ENT Specialist.. i&#39;m considering myself a revision if things dont settle down as hoped..  i&#39;m not saying that my surgeon Is bad but i wasnt buyng a car and if he spent 10  minutes more telling me i think you&#39;ll probably end up like this...i could have an easier post-op experience.. it&#39;s a rollercoaster
