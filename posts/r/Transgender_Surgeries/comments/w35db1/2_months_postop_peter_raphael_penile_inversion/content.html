Just contributing my data to the pool
</p>
<p>
Appearance: Satisfactory, slightly asymmetrical but that&#39;s whatever honestly, swelling will still ease as time goes, I&#39;m honestly happy with it because nothing matters to me more than just not having a stupid penis and I can look at myself naked in the mirror now when showering
</p>
<p>
Health/Pain: I was never exactly the healthiest beforehand and really should try to exercise more, but I was using the donut pillow up until week 6 or so, and still use it now for my desk chair. I can walk longer distances (4-5 miles) now without issue though.  Random pain has gone away by week 6, but sometimes especially at the morning or night, dilation feels more painful than usual. I sort of suspect scar tissue contraction is happening but I can&#39;t be sure.
</p>
<p>
Dilation Things: At the beginning I was at a little over 4 inches, I&#39;m consistently hitting 4.5-4.7 now. I start my dilation sessions with an extra small orange, and then move up to purple which is the smallest size for most people. I tried putting blue inside myself a few times, feels awful, I&#39;ll maybe try a serious attempt to size up in August or something like that, penetrative sex is low priority to me anyways. Lube is KY Jelly.
</p>
<p>
Mental Stuff: Extremely better, post-surgical depression is pretty much entirely gone now, my mind is very very happy with the current state of reality concerning my new body. Even dilation doesn&#39;t make me feel too down now.
</p>
<p>
Sexual Stuff: Masturbation was successful at about the 7 week mark. I didn&#39;t really orgasm with my former body so I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to. It&#39;s a lot of work for an admittedly very novel and nice payoff, but I can&#39;t imagine myself doing it more than twice or thrice a week unless my libido increases more. Maybe having a partner would make me want to do it more, who knows. There&#39;s a sort of viscous liquid that comes out of me when I orgasm, I have no clue what it is.
</p>
<p>
Miscellaneous: I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any hair inside of the canal although I initially thought that there might have been due to not having done hair removal. The fact that there&#39;s no hair despite the lack of removal may explain my lower depth, but that&#39;s just speculation and in the end lower depth is okay to me. In the meanwhile, I&#39;m still wearing pads every day because there&#39;s still discharge coming out of me and I presume a bit of lube from dilating is exiting me as well.
