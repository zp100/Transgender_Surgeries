I can understand the worry - but your face even with swelling reads completely different to me now - much more feminine - esp. your eyes and brow have a much more feminine appearance. You looked naturally feminine before but this procedure current swelling and all really made a difference for you, in a good way ! Safe healing !

Whenever the genioplasty was performed, he left a large divot with no transition in my jaw, so some of what you see regarding my jawline is swelling, and some is just what&#39;s left of my cut jaw bone, which frankly terrifies me moving forward.

I think it&#39;s reasonable to be worried. But you&#39;re still in the baby stages of recovery and it could heal to look really different than what you&#39;re worried about right now.
</p>
<p>
I got a lip lift really recently and it looked to me like it wasn&#39;t sewn together correctly on one side. I do think that side was sewn less ideally than the other, but over the last couple weeks it has also been healing differently and better than I could imagine at the time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll look wonderful! Try to calm the worries and remember you can&#39;t know how it will look yet.

Okay. Thank you for listening to me. It&#39;s good to know I&#39;m not alone, and others like you and I have faced the same fears and unknowns and have still come out better on the other side. I&#39;ll allay my worries until I see a more final result. Again, thank you for taking your time out of your day for meðŸ¥¹ðŸ«¶

I thought for the first ten days that i had destroyed my face. It turned out great but took 2 months to settle down.
