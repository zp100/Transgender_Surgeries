Pictures are below. I’m happy with how things are healing.  The scarring might look obvious but it’s often lost in skin folds and scarring tends to take a few years to fade for me (given some of my other surgeries). Everything functions the way I would want. :)  At this point, the only issues I have are occasional soreness but it’s under control with ibuprofen.

if you dont mind me asking, how was your experience with her? I am deciding between her and Bluebond-Langner and feel like there’s not as much info about her out there. also im curious how long you waited for a consultation and then how long after that for surgery? thank you, and congrats :-)

She&#39;s fantastic! Very very knowledgeable and sensitive to how to discuss potentially triggering anatomy. Her bedside manner is amazing as well!  My timeline to surgery is

, but Dr. Avanessian recently went on maternity leave so I&#39;m sure that will impact things.  I&#39;m not sure how it compares, but I had a FFS consult with her at the start of Nov. and  first available surgery was late July 2020.  Good luck! &lt;3

Her work is amazing. I’m wondering though, how is your sensitivity? Have you been able to achieve orgasm?
