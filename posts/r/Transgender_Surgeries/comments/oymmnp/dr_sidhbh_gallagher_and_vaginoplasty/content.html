<p>
I had a zero depth vaginoplasty with Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher 2 years ago in March. I regret my choice in surgeon immensely.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself had minimal complications, probably because I had went zero depth instead of full depth. But the actual results have not been good, and have caused issues for me since.
</p>
<p>
Primarily, she placed my urethra right next to my clitoris. What this has meant is that my urethra sits to the side and a little underneath it. Typically, you put the urethra above the vaginal opening (or the dimple in the case of zero depth). This has led to multiple urinary tract issues, as well as causing urine to shoot to the side horizontally while peeing. It also means that she left too much of my urethra in, and it makes a U-shape internally...which meant that my doctor couldn&#39;t actually see into my bladder in a recent cystoscopy.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also meant that I can&#39;t fully empty my bladder when urinating, as some gets trapped in the urethra and dribbles out after... I&#39;ve had to use incontinence pads for the last 2 years constantly.
</p>
<p>
The labia themselves also look...off. They look fine in certain positions...but in many others they look like wrinkly, crumpled flaps of skin...like a shriveled scrotum.
</p>
<p>
It also feels like she left too much erectile tissue in, being aroused is still sometimes slightly painful, tho it&#39;s gotten better.
</p>
<p>
Now that I know what&#39;s wrong, I&#39;m going to have to look jnto a revision...which is a cost I don&#39;t know if I can afford now -_-
</p>
<p>
Between my issues, and the horror stories I&#39;ve heard from a few other people who had full-depth, avoid her if you&#39;re getting a vaginoplasty of any sort. She recently moved from Indiana University to somewhere in Miami.

You won&#39;t get any argument from me about her. I still deal with the same urinary issues and I&#39;ve had 3 revisions for other issues.

It would be one thing if this was an issue where &#34;Every surgeon has a bad result once in a while&#34;. I&#39;ve heard from enough people to know better.
</p>
<p>
I second your motion to avoid.

She’s all over social media mostly supporting top surgery.

Sorry to hear your issues…

Yeah, for top surgery I&#39;ve heard she&#39;s not bad...it seems to be what she does the most of. Bottom surgery is where she seems to have a lot of gaps.

I&#39;ve been telling that story for almost 4 years now. I think IU-Health is just as guilty for letting her continue doing bottom surgery.

I&#39;m hoping to get a consult with Dr. McClung in CBus right now (and gotta do more research on him). He&#39;s my current urologist, and the one that did the cystoscopy. His vaginoplasty results look miles better than what I&#39;ve got going on, so here&#39;s hoping.

Try Dr Cecile Ferrando at the Cleveland Clinic, she did my last revision. I thought she was fantastic.

Right now I&#39;m doing some research on my urologist to see his results, Dr. McClung (CBus). So far I haven&#39;t found any horror stories, and his results that others have shared look a ton better than what I&#39;ve got going on, so I&#39;m hoping to schedule a consult soon.

She doesn&#39;t specialize in mtf surgery, but she does really well with ftm surgery because that is her specialty. She specializes in Masculoplasty which is a form of ftm top surgery that needs no drains post op and can be performed on patients with pretty much any bmi. She accepts big patients and is open on social media about the results and the procedures themselves. If you go to her Instagram you&#39;ll see plenty of results from her, all of which look pretty good. She should not be treated as an mtf surgeon because she isn&#39;t one, so do not go to her for mtf surgeries. Even though she offers mtf surgeries, she really shouldn&#39;t.

It&#39;s true that she&#39;s a poor MtF bottom surgeon, but she still bills herself as one. She has from the beginning in 2015-2016. I&#39;ve seen plenty of results from her. They are mediocre at best and if I&#39;m seeing the result images, you can bet her patient had/has complications. This goes for my own vaginal disaster under her scalpel. If you think she&#39;s honest, you don&#39;t know her. But yeah, I&#39;ll go ahead and agree. Avoid her for MtF bottom surgery.

How has urination been for you after the surgery.  Are you currently still unable to fully empty your bladder and having to pee frequently? Peeing has not been the same for me after I had my surgery. It harder for me to go and it takes effort and concentration.

I never feel like I&#39;ve fully emptied my bladder. Ever. It always feels like there&#39;s more in there even when an ultrasound shows it empty...it&#39;s just trapped in my extra long urethra -_-

I&#39;m on medication currently to help with my urine flow. Also at times, I have to self intermittent catheterize myself with a tube to drain out the urine because my tube feels obstructed. Its super frustrating and has affected my quality of life.

Ya, it&#39;s great, isn&#39;t it? This urinary complication appears to come with many of Gallagher&#39;s bottom surgeries. I love the fact that I&#39;m now forced to cover the expense for the two medications to avoid wetting my pants, and getting urine through my urethra.

I have had 8 revisions since my original gcs with her. The worst was around my urethra. The urethra was placed in the wrong place next to my clitoris causing multiple strictures. I have since had it relocated to the proper position and life is better. Next of the list was the amount of of erectile tissue left behind. It made penetration impossible and still has after another procedure to correct it. I still have no sensation vaginally and is painful to dilate at times. My clitoris has had tissue growth over it making it less sensitive and a huge issue to correct. There has been an uncomfortable amount of tension around it as well since the initial surgery. I never dreamed I would be one of those statistics of surgery gone wrong. Wish I had waited and saw another surgeon.
