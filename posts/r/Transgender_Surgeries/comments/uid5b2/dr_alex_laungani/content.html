He wasn’t my surgeon but he did do rounds a couple of times while I was in Montréal last month.  He struck me as very caring and knowledgeable.  He was previously at the Mayo Clinic so his resume is top flight.

I originally was supposed to have surgery with Dr. Laungani. However, I couldn’t find any reviews of his work. I just called them, and told them I wanted Dr. Brassard, they just gave me a new date. From my understanding, once you’ve been approved for surgery, you have three years to use it. If she calls they will just give her a new surgery date.
</p>
<p>
Also, Im going back May 12th to have my breast augmentation with Dr. Laungani. He was very professional and friendly when I had my consultation with him.

It’s Montreal so it’s a cheap vagina. Done in 1:30 minute. If you can try to go somewhere else I highly recommend for your mental and physical health but also for your sexual health.
</p>
<p>
Like this if for life. You deserve more than being treated like a cash cow.
</p>
<p>
Also Brassard is under investigation from le collège des médecins for serious allegations.
</p>
<p>
They are super big enterprise ans have tons of minions on the sites so don’t be surprise if you get  super promoted.
</p>
<p>
Just telling you the fact. 1:30 minutes SRS when most girl feel pain and don’t enjoy inter course.

Lol that is a lie. Brassard does them in 1:30 min. He’s a crook a thief and belongs in prison for the number of girl’s future and mental health he destroyed.
</p>
<p>
To say that he take 2-4 hours means you are probably one of those minion.
</p>
<p>
The guy is going to prison for his crime against our community.

Lol. It’s a constant. 100’s of girls have had their life destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Why the coverage hasn’t gotten better over the years. Because Montreal wants everything.
</p>
<p>
Honestly don’t even write to me. You don’t know nothing about who they are what they do or are ready to do save their face.

I’m gonna be with Maud Belanger in a month, she seems incredible and she was highly suggested. I have a friend who had Dr Laungani for both BA amd SRS and she was very satisfied!
