Damn… that’s hard. I got lucky and got a date on my first try, but I stayed up all night and kept refreshing the pasaje 60times per minute until I saw the calendar change. Maybe January wasn’t one of the most wanted dates.

Sorry to hear you&#39;re having trouble. Help the ignorant here though, is there a certain booking window with finite places or something  and you have to try to apply every year? Is it not a constant, rolling thing? I want to go with Dr Suporn or Dr Bank but I dont know much about the actual application process, I just see people saying its a bit of a lottery and I dont get why?

Every few months, they open a block of availabilities for a year in advance. So for example, just now they opened up their availability for Aug-Nov 2024. You apply when they open up (usually you have a few days to apply), and then it’s literally a lottery. They say they have about 100+ applications every time, yet about ~42 slots open for this period. They pick names at random for these openings. If you don’t get picked, well too bad you get nothing: no wait list, no guarantee etc. They say you have better odds if you’ve applied multiple times, but at this point I’m not even sure that’s true. And that’s the whole system. It’s theoretically possible you may never be picked because it’s just random who gets a spot.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been waiting a whole year to try get in for surgery that’s a year in advance and I still have nothing, instead of just putting me on a 2 year waitlist and being half way through the wait.

Wow. Do you happen tocknow if this is the same for Dr Bank? I know he trained under Suporn but not sure if he operates out of the same clinic.

Also, how do you get notified of when they open the block of bookings? Do you have to contact them and get put in a database/registry? Also, when you say they&#39;ve opened up  availability just now, do you mean like NOW, or has the window already closed???

They tell you in advance on their website when it&#39;s going to open, you have the 3 days to send them an email whith your preferences
</p>
<p>
Their calendar for 2024 is fully booked now, it&#39;s too late

Wow. Guess that&#39;s the result when you&#39;re one of the best in the world. Oh well, I still need to get within the BMI range anyway, but I guess I might have to start looking for backup options. Thanks for the info. Good luck!

It literally is a lottery.
</p>
<p>
It used to be first come first serve where they would update the website at a certain time and you would have to sit there refreshing the page and then send the email as soon as it updated. People complained about it because the website had terrible caching and would update at different times for different people meaning if you got unlucky and it didn’t update at the exact correct time you would be too late (this is what happened to me the first time, mine updated 5 mins later than the actual time so I missed out).
</p>
<p>
It’s now literally just a lottery where you send your email within a few days after the calendar update and they randomly select from among those who sent requests. It’s an unbelievably stupid system and has caused me more mental health issues than pretty much anything else. I would far prefer a normal wait list even if it’s 2+ years to the stress and uncertainty and anxiety that their system brings.

Thats bananas! And how do you even know when the calendar is being updated/they&#39;re taking new applications?

They post it on advance in their website. The next update will probably be sometime in January next year.

Technically no but I want results that are as cis looking as possible and no other surgeon in Thailand or Australia achieves that in my opinion from the research I have done. If you have any suggestions I would love to hear them though.

Yeah, I went through that once with their office and immediately went elsewhere to my other top choice.  Confirmed a date in a week and a half with my surgeon and am very happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
I decided for myself that my journey is not to be treated like getting concert tickets.  FYI - I got my submission in with Suporn office in the first 30 seconds of the calendar opening - completely followed their directions and still didn’t get a date.
</p>
<p>
So happy I didn’t wait a minute longer.

Although their system is bizzare it’s not so different in practice to the popular surgeons in he USA who have multi year wait lists. I suspect the uncertainty make it worse though.
</p>
<p>
Personally I’d keep trying.

I would vastly prefer a multi year wait list with a guaranteed date to the existential dread of not knowing if I will ever get a date. I don’t think it’s really possible to describe how terrible it’s been for my mental health. Having hope and then having it sucked away every single time is awful. Especially when my girlfriend and her best friend both got their date with Suporn on the first try with no issues.
