Good luck on your healing journey. You&#39;re in the worst of it now, but it will get so-so much better as the days go on!

All I had to cover was my plan‚Äôs Max out of pocket for the year which was $4,500 total but I had already put in $600 so I payed $3,900 to the hospital a fee days before my surgery.

No, in the US health insurance plans have a ‚ÄúMax out of Pocket‚Äù amount that is the max amount you‚Äôll pay for medical care, some also have a deductible which is when your plan will start paying for treatment but mine didn‚Äôt have it I know its confusing, it took me a while to understand how it works.
</p>
<p>
Well apart from that my plan pays %90 of procedures so the $3,900 was my %10 copay. The $600 I had already payed out of pocket plus the $3,900 for hospital fees completed my 2022 max out of pocket. So they‚Äôll cover %100 of surgeon fees, anesthesiologist fees and every other procedure or visit I might have for the rest of the year As long as i keep paying for my plan

Yes they said laser was ok, but electrolysis is more recommended. Also I believe it was 7inch he mentioned and A lot of circumcised people choose ppv because of peritoneal graft and its added benefit for depth.

Oh well idk if you could do the same as the health care systems vary greatly between the US and Canada. But basically i used my savings to pay for the most expensive plan Blue shield of California has and to meet my expected max out of pocket which is $4500. Between monthly payments and the $4500 I should be paying a few thousand dollars more than for a BA but I got all my pre op care, hair removal, meds, tests, the actual bottom surgery covered, I also got approved for my BA and FFS already so in reality I‚Äôm paying coins for all these procedures.

I will have to pay out of pocket for FFs and BA so if it‚Äôs not covered it makes sense to prioritize those. It will likely take me about 10 years from now to get to a point where I can and pay for srs‚Ä¶ sucks really with the cost of living I just don‚Äôt earn enough with my six figure job to pay for a mortgage and $100k worth of surgery and then I have to think about doubling that to get SRS. We just don‚Äôt have the same level of insurance options if any here in Canada for FFS, SRS and BA. I can get coverage for SRS but they are very specific and many surgeons won‚Äôt work with my Governments insurance

In that case you can look into having your surgeries in Thailand and Mexico, Thailand is known for the bottom surgeons and Dr L√°zaro C√°rdenas has really good results for ffs I believe both places you can also get BA for around 4K. I considered those options early in my transition when insurance coverage wasn‚Äôt as accepted as now. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be paying a whole lot less if you go abroad

Did you experience genital atrophy prior if at all? I am and am kind of concerned if it will hurt my chances of getting a nice result. Looks great by the way.

I honestly did maybe in the last 2 years. But I was uncircumcised. And also its PPV so the peritoneal flap will add some depth as well.

Did you consider going with anyone else?
</p>
<p>
I have thought about going to Dr Crane who is much closer to me or Ashley DeLeon but having see Dr Min Jun&#39;s work a few times and the youtube video he did some time ago he seems super great all around.

PPT seems like the most viable option for someone like me who‚Äôs interested in ultimately ending up with mixed genitalia so the information is extremely valuable to me.

Yeah, that‚Äôs why I am looking specifically at PPT, since it‚Äôs the option least reliant on tissue recycling and why I want a firsthand report from someone on how the interior bits are

There‚Äôs very few surgeons who do this kind of surgery so you probably won‚Äôt have much choice in how it‚Äôs done.

True. And that‚Äôs assuming I even am ever able to do anything past an orchi, but I happen to live within 4 hours of one (only benefit of Detroit proximity) so if and when, then likely there.

How far down does the peritoneal tissue extend?  Does it go all the way to the opening or is did the doctor use penial and scrotal skin in the vagina?

Lovely! His aesthetics are really good! Being local(ish) to both, I have Wittenberg at the top of my list, but Dr. Jun is rising fast. I&#39;m curious if you considered her and if so, why you chose him?

Thank you! I never really considered sigmoid because of the cutting off a part of colon part and idk ppv seemed like a good method to try. I believe I could‚Äôve also had PI I had mild atrophy but I‚Äôm sure I still had enough tissue. I guess the selling point was the added self lubrication.

How long after your consult did you get your surgery date? We&#39;re you completely ready with all your hair removal done?

I had my initial consultation on 05/2021 but I didn‚Äôt have insurance at the time so I had to wait til this year, I initiated the process around April of this year and got a date for January 2023.
</p>
<p>
I had already submitted all my letters, insurance had approved it and hair was cleared for surgery so I asked to be put on the waitlist and got a sooner date.
