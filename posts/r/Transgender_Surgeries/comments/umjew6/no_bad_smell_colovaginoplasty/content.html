<p>
So I have seen and heard a lot of people who are anxious about the fragrance of their vagina if they go for a colo-vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I had one about six months ago now and never had a single issue with a bad smell.  I have been considering this quite a lot and wondering why my operation seems to be very successful in this area. What I think it comes down to is the strictest adherence to the low residue diet.
</p>
<p>
Additionally I started nil by mouth and fasting about 24 hours earlier than I was asked to.
</p>
<p>
My theory was that the cleaner my bowels, were the easier the surgery would be.
</p>
<p>
There are several benefits to this even though it was incredibly challenging at the time. The first benefit is that the surgeons told me I had the cleanest and easiest bowels they have ever worked with.  Secondly it also made my recovery quicker because less time was spent actually having to manipulate my internal components in the construction of the vagina.
</p>
<p>
My understanding is there is a direct correlation between the risk of complications the recovery time and how much time is spent having to clean and prepare the bowel for reconstructive surgery once this has been cut out.
</p>
<p>
Additionally the next benefit is the fact I had no bad smell at all; and almost from the first day where I could recover enough to remove bandages and not smell just blood; she has always had the fragrance of a vagina.
</p>
<p>
Also I think the cumulative benefits of an easier surgery, a quicker recovery time, a lower risk of complications, and a better outcome all justify my theory of being very rigid and excessive about sticking to the low residue diet.
</p>
<p>
and so for my fellow sisters who may be considering this I will give you my diet.
</p>
<p>
Every single day for the 10 days preceding the surgery when I was allowed to eat I would simply start the morning with a pot of water that has about 2.5 liters in it.  This is about 5 pints.  Good quality mineral water.
</p>
<p>
Into the past of water I would put 1 or 2 stock cubes, a few peeled potatoes or pasta.  A couple of skinless chicken breasts sliced up or white fish fillets.  And that was about it.  Nothing more.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the week I would have more potatoes, more chicken, more flavor, more bulk.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the week it was almost completely water was a little bit of flavor and a few nutrients and nothing else.
</p>
<p>
And then was told I had to have no food for 24 hours before the surgery and nil by mouth from about 8 oâ€™clock the night before.
</p>
<p>
However I started having only water one day earlier and nil by mouth as instructed.
</p>
<p>
Being honest it was incredibly difficult to stick to this very rigid diet.
</p>
<p>
And of course because after the vagina plasty you are not allowed to eat anything for several days as well.
</p>
<p>
I think at the point in time where I was allowed to start eating again, nothing had gone into my mouth for almost a week.  Also the night before the surgery with the stress and the drugs and the lack of nutrition I was feeling very weak and tired and the fleet enema was incredibly uncomfortable on such an empty stomach.
</p>
<p>
However we all know that the process of going through the surgery is not particularly pleasant or comfortable what is important is a good recovery low risk of complications and a great outcome.
</p>
<p>
I firmly believe that by having such an empty bowel, that was so well prepared for surgery, that there was not a single speck of any dirt in there that could provide the foundations for the smell that people often worry about.
</p>
<p>
So, I think that ensuring a well flushed incredibly clean and empty set of intestines, before going into the clinic, is challenging but has so many upsides itâ€™s worth it.
</p>
<p>
Also I did start to overeat on the other side of my recovery and now I need to drop a bit of weight again.  Oh well.

Totally agree with you!! My surgery was a lot quicker then he was expecting, he it was due to how clean everything was. Also recovery and healing time was a lot easier and reduced from what was shared originally

Thank you for sharing what seems to be a very logical solution to a problem that no one has thus far experienced.  Congratulations on your success.  Thank you for the encouraging information for me personally.  I will be 76 in less than a month and I was just approved for GRS by my Primary/Transgender Doc in January.  I have suffered atrophy for years and had an orchi 14 months ago.  For those reasons, I am looking to have the colon vaginoplasty but to further complicate, I must depend on Medicare for coverage.  Would you be willing to share with me the name of your surgeon, please?  Thank you.

Dr. Ivan Manero, IM gender clinic, but in Barcelona, Spain.  I flew there from Asia to go to him because he is that good.  I donâ€™t think that will work for you though, but good luck.  And well done on finally getting there.  I had mine at 48â€¦.

Thank you, for this write up. Considering S.Colon for my SRS method, but honestly, it scares me!
</p>
<p>
Was there any tummy bulge? And how is Bowl Movement now? Some report that afterwards, it&#39;s not the same ever again....

Not a single problem with anything, no visible scar, no smell, no problem eating or pooing.  Nothing except the usual trauma of surgery and recovery.  No bulge.  I have put on some weight.  I think this is due to a change in hormones and a Few months being more sedentary and some indulgent eating.  I am actually booked in for liposculpture later this year to use some of that fat for hips, tits and lips.  Same surgeon.  Yayâ€¦

Seriously!! There is so much made up myth regarding this method, it actually made me nervous when a suregon suggested this would be my best option. So it really is best to ask those who actually had it done. Thanks for the info.

Thanks for sharing this.
</p>
<p>
What was your recovery time in the end? When were you able to go back to your normal life? I&#39;m worried about things like driving, climbing the stairs etc.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure mine will be laparoscopic either.

Hi.  Good luck with your journey.  After 3 weeks I flew intercontinentally from Europe to Asia with 2 suitcases.  Not ideal, but not a choice.  The first week was hard.  The second week was challenging but felt progress.  After week 3 I felt a lot stronger but was very careful with lifting weights and relied on others for lifting hand luggage into the overhead lockers, etc.
</p>
<p>
At about 6 weeks I felt no significant limitations other than avoiding sex and was careful around my new anatomy.  Dilating still felt very ritualistic and significant.
</p>
<p>
At 2 months I was impatient to get on with life but was still cautious with the very heaviest of tasks and was still learning about my body.
</p>
<p>
At 3 months I felt more or less completely healed.
</p>

Thank you for the response. This is really helpful, thank you again.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll put up a post with my experience when I get mine done. It will be interesting to see if the non-laparoscopic version causes more strain, although would be very difficult to compare notes because all our bodies are so unique... I would be very happy if I can resume a normal life after 3 months. I don&#39;t really care for sex.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be discharged within 6 to 7 days but will be staying close to the hospital for a couple of months. Hopefully everything goes well!
