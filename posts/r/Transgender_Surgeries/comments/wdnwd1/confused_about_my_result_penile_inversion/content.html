Okay, so I have made a post about this a couple of days ago, but i‚Äôm still confused and decided to add more photos, hoping someone can explain this‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
So the first photo is 4 days post op, second one is 22 days, third photo is 39 days, and fourth photo is where i show you what i dont get.
</p>
<p>
Maybe i just misunderstood, but i thought i would have like ‚Äúone opening‚Äù for both my clit, urethra and so on, and also my vagina. But i have two openings, where i have some skin in between (i circled this on the photo) and this skin is connected ü§î my vagina is at the bottom where i point at on the photo. What is going on? When i see other results everything is just open and they have everything in ‚Äúone opening‚Äù?
</p>
<p>
I hope you understand what i mean, english is my second language so my formulation is not the best üòÖ
</p>
<p>
I had Penile inversion and i do have time for check up with my surgeon in 9 days, but i‚Äôm just dying to know if this is normal.ü´£

I understand your confusion.
</p>
<p>
When they do the penile inversion they place the urethra and clitoris in place then create the space that the penile skin will be pushed in to to create the vagina. This would of course cover the urethra and clitoris so a slit is cut into the skin and stitched to either side of the urethra and clitoris exposing them.
</p>
<p>
At this point they are two separate holes and will stay that way unless you surgeon creates labia that make them look like there is one entrance. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t look like your surgeon did this for you.
</p>
<p>
The best case is that the labia mostly hide the entrance to the vagina as otherwise it looks like penile skin pushed inside. Mine unfortunately looks more like an asshole than a vagina.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping I can get something done to it in a revision with a different surgeon as I had a massive falling out with the twat that did mine.
</p>
<p>
Maybe ask your surgeon when you meet them at your check-up.
</p>
<p>
I will edit this to show a picture of my &#39;asshole&#39; vagina. Here
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/w6sdn4/8_months_post_op_bellringer_parkside_uk_advice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/w6sdn4/8_months_post_op_bellringer_parkside_uk_advice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
</a>
Ignore the fact that I have to pull away some extra skin that needs cutting out but you can see labia enclosing most of it giving the impression of one entrance.

Thank you so much!! This really makes sense! Unfortunately in my country they only make this one surgery (because we dont pay for it here) and because of that they only do whats necessary, so i dont think my surgeon would do anymore ü•∫ but i will for sure ask her when i go see her. With that said im still so happy and grateful to have had the surgery!
</p>
<p>
I will also ask about something that is really strange as well üòÖ (this is odd) but in my vagina something is sticking out a bit when i spread legs that looks like a little tongue lol.. when i dilate it goes back in there like its a part of my ‚Äúwalls‚Äù in there, doesent make sence i know ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sorry your not happy about your result, i do think it looks really nice though and you have healed really well so far! Hope you get the revision you wish for üôèüèª

Honestly you are healing very well. Your scar lines are placed in a much better position than mine are and thin so will hopefully not be very visible at all.
</p>
<p>
As your swelling goes down you may find that the labia that I can now see in the last picture may improve the look. It took me 6 months for most of the swelling to go down.
</p>
<p>
I know you are happy now but I think it will improve further and look even better in a few months x

Penile inversions generally need a labiaplasty to tidy things up-at least it used to be the practice.  Some docs like Meltzer still do a two step approach,

So how does a revision work like say I got a botched surgery can I then go to say like a surgeon in Thailand to get it fixed. Also what&#39;s the extent can they do, like is it possible to be so badly done that they just are like &#34;oh they messed her bits up, I don&#39;t know if I can fix that&#34; or can they just start from scratch so to speak and give you what they would&#39;ve gave you. Apprehensive to get SRS because money is tight and I really like every girl like a semi normal looking Vagina

Depends on the surgeon. A lot will not revise others work.
</p>
<p>
The one i was hoping to use has taken ill and no longer practicing and there is virtually nobody in the uk that i feel comfortable using.
</p>
<p>
Good luck, i hope you have a nice result the first time round x

It‚Äôs seems like maybe a partial prolapse of the vaginal canal? I only say this because regular PI vaginoplasty are at risk for that and because of the four day post op and the 22 day post op photos show a big difference and this is thankfully very fixable. They are able to fix the vaginal canal if that‚Äôs something you would want to do.
