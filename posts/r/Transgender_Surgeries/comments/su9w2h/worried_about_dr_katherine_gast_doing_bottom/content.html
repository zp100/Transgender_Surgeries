Hey, so I&#39;m still a good ways off from bottom surgery, at least 6 months if not over a year. Currently I&#39;m on Wisconsin Medicaid and just confirmed with my HMO they will not cover anything out of state. However WI doesn&#39;t have very many options. The only one here I know of that does vaginoplasty is Dr. Katherine Gast in Madison, and posts about her have been... mixed. I don&#39;t know if I should just settle with her and give it a go or what to do. Any advice? Is she actually bad or is she better than some of the posts make her out to be? I want to get this done as soon as possible, but I cannot afford paying out of pocket in a different state.
</p>

I&#39;m one of those folks who has talked negatively about Gast and I&#39;m down to answer questions. I did my research before I saw her, got people to share pics of results, just a whole lot of stuff you know?
</p>
<p>
Now, here&#39;s the thing — even the best surgeons can mess up or botch someone. Even some of the surgeons best known for excellent results have given people poor outcomes. I think what matters then is how the doctor will react after, and if the problem can be fixed by them if it happens.
</p>
<p>
This is why I cannot recommend Gast under any circumstance. I was repeatedly gaslit about the issues with my results (which pelvic floor therapists and other surgeons have confirmed are strange and sub-par). When I attempted a revision with her (which she wasn&#39;t thrilled about) not only did I not get better or have the severe aesthetic flaws fixed, but my issues got
<strong>
worse
</strong>
.
</p>
<p>
From here, she told me everything was fine, this is a normal result, etc. Now I have a competent surgeon willing to do a proper revision, but due to how Gast messed up, I&#39;ll be losing all of my depth (I have to literally have it removed for my health and safety).
</p>
<p>
Seriously, if you&#39;re not willing to gamble or can&#39;t handle not having the result of your dreams, don&#39;t go to her. You may end up with a botch job she won&#39;t actually want to fix and be stuck with it.

Do you know if her reputation is similar for phalloplasty?
</p>
<p>
I am ftm and had just heard of her, been trying to do my research but struggling to find post op photos online or people (particularly ftm) talking about their experiences.

I&#39;ve heard of folks having their top surgeries messed up a bit by her, but I&#39;ve also never heard a peep about her doing phalloplasty. I&#39;d honestly have EXTREME caution going with her.

For what it&#39;s worth, I had surgery with her back in May.  Scheduling was quick (consult July 2020, recieved my date 3 weeks later).  I have a great result and the hospital staff were very nice.  I received prompt responses to questions I had via MyChart.  While Dr. Gast doesn&#39;t do a lot of chit-chat, she knows her stuff and is clearly very competent.  If I needed to do it over again, I&#39;d make the same decision.

While I don&#39;t share pictures ( that&#39;s reserved for my wife and doctor) I can tell you pre-op, I wasn&#39;t very big ( a little less than average) and ended up with almost exactly 5 inches of depth.  Acstetic is  spot on. No problems with urine stream.  Very sensate clitoris but well hooded.
</p>
<p>
I spoke with several women who worked with her prior to my surgery who were nice enough to show pictures and their results/experience were similar.
</p>
<p>
Again, this is just my experience and result and YMMV.

Reviews are good and . It&#39;s 2025 when I am having my surgery with her. I feel that, hear nothing but good things about her now.  Some blame the Dr. Yet it could be an issue while recovering.  Full stories are not always posted. In my opinion.  July 8th next year I will be on her table. I have a great feeling it will all work out.

There&#39;s a facebook group for former and pending patient&#39;s of hers. All I can say from my time there is that there were people who went to her who were satisfied and got good results. Going on that group to ask folks for info/pics might help put your mind at ease?

I’m curious to how many of those claiming they had a “good result” are gaslighting themselves to believe such. Many are in denial. And this is a major surgery you should do RIGHT once, because even if revision is needed, it’s easier to do on a result which has NOT been botched.
</p>
<p>
Is this doctor similar to the results of Dr. Zhao, Dr. BBL, or Dr. Min Jun?
</p>
<p>
It’s one thing having gender affirming bottom surgery. And it’s one thing to have a hack job done, assuming “confidence” for no longer having dysphoria, but exchanging one problem for a new problem of disability.
</p>
<p>
If their results are anything like Dr. Rumer’s…RUN. Be patient and find another route. Your heth matters first.

I had my original surgery plus TWO revisions with her. I would never recommend her. My vagina doesn’t look great and have even had sexual partners comment on it. It’s extremely embarrassing and causes me dysphoria. Ask me anything

I can only speak to my personal experience, but I recently had my bottom surgery with Dr. Gast, it was zero depth vaginoplasty. She was very nice, reassuring, and knowledgeable. The surgery went smoothly and I&#39;ve barely had any pain at all. I&#39;m really happy with my results and I honestly wish Dr. Gast and her team were my primary care providers. They&#39;ve been great to work with. I did have one complication that was a bit of a traumatic experience, but it wasn&#39;t the fault of Dr. Gast or her team, I wouldn&#39;t even say it was the fault of the E.R. doctors, it was just bad timing to be honest. When I was 3 days post op I had to be driven back to the hospital because I could no longer urinate on my own and my stomach hurt really bad from it (which turned out to be the only severe pain of my recovery). It was really late on a Sunday night (and I had a 2 hour car ride to the hospital) so the emergency room was the only thing open and it was extremely busy. I ended up waiting a long time and when I got a room the E.R. doctors didn&#39;t feel comfortable putting a catheter in because my surgery was so recent and swollen. Someone from Dr. Gast&#39;s team ended up coming to the E.R. to place the catheter and I went home again the next morning. It was a long night but in hindsight I&#39;m glad the E.R. team didn&#39;t try to place the catheter and mess something up. I had the catheter taken back out at my first follow up appointment and have been all good since. I&#39;m happy to share more of my experience if you&#39;d like or if it&#39;s helpful at all. I&#39;m new to Reddit so don&#39;t know how to do much on here, but I&#39;ll try to figure it out, haha.

While every surgeon has negative results, the good ones have a large number of positive ones to balance it out. Her ratio is not good, and she doesn&#39;t have many results posted anyway, which is also not good. Very high risk.

<p>
I really like your analysis. Can you think of any surgeon&#39;s offhand with what you&#39;d consider to be good ratios? Not as recommendation, I&#39;d just like to look at their wiki pages to get feel for what a good ratio on the wiki looks like.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Look at the surgeons in the USA and Thailand that have large numbers of reviews. You can&#39;t work out much from the  others.

Numerically speaking, what would you consider to be a good ratio between positive and negative reviews?
</p>
<p>
When I look at product reviews on Amazon, I look for 75+% positive (i.e. 4 &amp; 5 star) but I have no idea what&#39;s realistic with SRS. Any guidance on this is much appreciated.

I&#39;d not really put it that way. I&#39;m more interested in finding the best surgeon rather than one who&#39;s good enough, and then seeing if the risks for that one are acceptable. Risk in terms of available information and results/complications.
</p>
<p>
Amazon is full of fake reviews and surgeon&#39;s reviews are not entirely trustworthy either, and the consequences of choosing badly are far worse.
</p>
<p>
This might help a bit

She&#39;s mostly good. She did my zero depth and I&#39;m part of the group where many people have seen her. There are a few extremely vocal people who hate their results. Everything is opinion, and those are valid too, but from what I&#39;ve seen of the vocal minority they&#39;ve also been somewhat unusual cases. You&#39;re doing the right thing researching.

Okay. That&#39;s definitely reassuring. Seeing a bunch of posts talking about being &#34;butchered&#34; didn&#39;t exactly inspire confidence.  Good to hear from other people that say they had good results. Sometimes its hard to know if someone is actually bad or if there is just a vocal minority

The larger context is that since insurance companies started covering srs a host of new providers including Gast have emerged.  We’ve also seen an increase in botched surgeries as new surgeons get up to speed (and some never do) and with more people getting srs the overall number must be going up.  Even the best of the best have some less satisfactory results or healing difficulties.  The best thing we can do is research, ask and share.   Try to go with the best (for you) and most consistent surgeon possible.   It is far better to wait a year (if you can) than going to Philadelphia or Florida.

That makes a lot of sense. Main reason to possibly wait a year is my insurance may require 1 year of full time real life experience. Maybe my therapist can help lie about that to shorten it down, but its hard to say.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have a whole lot going on right now cause covid and depression kind ground my life to a halt for a bit. Since I don&#39;t really have much happening for a while yet I figure that its a great time to get a surgery with a long recovery period, but the time for rle could put a damper on that. It wouldn&#39;t he good to keep life on hold for a whole nother year if I don&#39;t have to.

Yeah, I hear you.  Keep in mind that basically we get one shot at this procedure.  It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders.👍

I’ve been trying to get surgery with her for the past 4 years. Her scheduling staff suck! She’s short and to the point. Ive had my date moved 3 times now. If you need a laparoscopic robot they push you out even further. It sounds like results are mixed.

If you&#39;re neurodivergent she is not a good option. She&#39;s not aware of trans mental health issues &amp; fails to connect with patients. She is normie as fuck &amp; takes patients that fit into her idea of transness.
