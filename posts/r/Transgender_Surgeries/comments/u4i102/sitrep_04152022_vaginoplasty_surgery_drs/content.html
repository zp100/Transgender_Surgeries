</p>
<p>
Good afternoon! Attended my first post-op PT this morning at Rusk, located on the 16th floor of the NYU facility on 38th St in Manhattan.
<strong>
BRING dilators
</strong>
to this appointment is
<strong>
<em>
mandatory.
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The appointment ran just about an hour for the purposes of Pelvic Floor Therapy. I found my Therapist to be friendly and has worked with RBbL women for about the past 5-years. The appointment began by asking if I brought my dilators (I had) and then developing my profile to determine the therapy plan.
</p>
<p>
In detail, we discussed habits of urination, changes since surgery and how I was coping. Next, bowel habits and looking at a chart to convey the appearance of my regular bowel movements, frequency, any current constipation, etc. Constipation can cause vaginal bleeding, something to avoid!
</p>
<p>
Next up, dilation. My dilation schedule was discussed, any problems or issues, pain, soreness, etc. I‚Äôm not having any problems or issues. No pain, however some soreness in the bottom pelvic floor muscles as the dilator passes between the hip bones(?), and that is getting better every day. She asks what color dilator, (I‚Äôm on the green).
</p>
<p>
Then she asks for my dilators. I hand them over as she tells me she is going to observe me dilating. Asks me to remove everything from the waist-down (I can keep the socks on). Lay down on the table and cover myself with the provided sheet, if desired. My therapist pulls the big privacy curtain closed and tells me she will return shortly.
</p>
<p>
I do as instructed, and soon after the therapist returns. She places a round, firm cloth covered cushion under my knees. (I was expecting I would use the same type wedges I was given at discharge from the hospital). She takes up my green dilator and hands it to me. I ask for two things: if I can fold the pillow under my head bc laying flat doesn‚Äôt work for me and a single glove. She replies in the affirmative and offers to raise the head of the table, then does so to my liking. Hands me the glove, which I put on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
NOTE:
</strong>
The nitrile glove hack was passed to me by a RBbL Sister, recently having her surgery with this team. Seems she learned this from Kevin, the Team King Guru of dilation, bc it allows a non-slip grip on the dilator covered in lubricant. This has been among the best tips passed to me. Ladies,
<strong>
<em>
IT WORKS
</em>
</strong>
‚ù£Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Next my therapist offers me Surgilube. I apply a film across my vulva just above and below the introitus, place some in my vagina to aid insertion. Next, coat my dilator and begin.
</p>
<p>
Now, while dilating in an unfamiliar room with a therapist I just met observing my every move, not using the pillow wedges I was sent home with so my positioning is different, is a bit disconcerting to say in the least. However, all external factors not withstanding my dilation was done to my therapist‚Äôs satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
I had to shift my position a couple times to make the insertion more comfortable. She asks how I know when the dilator has reached the apex of my vagina. For me, there seems like a small bit of resistance just before full insertion. Almost like a small ring (if you will). At that point, I‚Äôm relaxed and surrender myself to the final push and the tip of the dilator contacts the apex. I explain that contact at that point produces a bit of a tug in my abdomen (related to the upper vagina anchor point established during the laparoscopic portion of my surgery) that feels like the very faint beginnings of a deep orgasm. There also is a bit of resistance that ‚Äúbounces back‚Äù the dilator when contact is made.
</p>
<p>
She checks the markings on the dilator for depth. I haven‚Äôt measured, and she didn‚Äôt say, but noted it was less than a thumb width from the face of my vulva to the single notch.
</p>
<p>
My therapist asks me how long I do each dilation. 15-minutes. She then explains they teach RBbL women to rotate the dilator four positions during full insertion. This is to keep the apex from narrowing. I explain this was passed to me by another RBbL Sister, and that I do the rotation during the last 5-minutes (or so) of the session, a minute or so for each position. She seems very pleased with that response. She then critiques my dilation technique. I‚Äôm told it ‚Äúis absolutely perfect!‚Äù (Yay‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è)
</p>
<p>
At this point she asks me to stop. She asks and I hand her my dilator for her to clean. She hands me a wad of wet wipes to clean up.
</p>
<p>
Next on the agenda, scar management. She explains that because I‚Äôm only a week out of surgery there is no need for aggressive massage along the labia majora suture lines at this time. This is to prevent any sutures from opening and causing dehiscence. She shows me how/where to place/use my fingers to perform the massage. It is surprisingly gentle. She also shows me how to help drain the lymph nodes in my lower abdomen to promote healing. Again, surprising gentle ‚Äúbrushing‚Äù motions over the skin. I can do that!
</p>
<p>
My therapist tells me I only need one additional appointment and to stop by the schedule desk in the building lobby on my way out . . . places my dilator back in the carry, tells me to take my time to clean and dress, then see myself out. She‚Äôll see me at my next appointment. I ask if I need bring my dilators and she tells me ‚ÄúNo‚Äù then pulls the curtain closed and leaves the room.
</p>
<p>
So there you have it. Nothing to be concerned about. My therapist was matter of fact and friendly. She obviously knows what she is doing and made me feel comfortable as possible under the circumstances. I highly recommend this facility to all RBbL Sisters who follow me in their surgery.
</p>
<p>
On a personal note: My wife and I set myself up to be able to dilate in comfort and have everything I need in the process within reach of the bed, without having to move, once in position. Honestly, my dilations get easier each time and for me, are approaching near religious experiences.
</p>
<p>

I know this is late, but congratulations! And thank you so, so much for all that you&#39;ve shared about your journey. I only recently discovered the records of your journey, and they are proving to be an invaluable source of information, advice and encouragement for me. As of last month, I&#39;ve got a consultation scheduled with RBbL in June of 2024 and have started to stress out a great deal about hair removal. This, along with a very limited set of options in my area, caused me to be hasty in choosing a technician, I think. I had my first session three days ago, received poor communication and information from them, and ended up having an awful, painful session, and the area looks just awful. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s normal or not. Anyway, your post history has led me to reach out to the Papillon center to learn more about their hair removal services, and your detailed timeline of your experience with the Langone team is helping so much. Just wanted to express my gratitude; this is a terrifying thing to be working towards, with very little support and a great deal of confusion. All of your posts help me feel a little less alone and afraid! Keep rocking it, sister! &lt;3

You are welcome and thank you for the kind words. My intent all along is to give back to this sub for the invaluable information and help I received from Sisters here . . .
</p>
<p>
I still have catch up posts I need to make to fill in the blanks of my experiences to this point. I will get to them ASAP.
</p>
<p>
I believe I posted the path I took and lessons learned about getting the sooner jump on the consult process with the RBbL Team. If not, feel free to DM me. With ü¶Ü‚Äôs in a row, you stand a very good chance to pick up a cancellation slot well before 2024. Dunno, but the political climate seems to be turning against the transgender community, so any jump ahead you can get in this entire process is a plus.
</p>
<p>
My best to you in your journey to living your Truth‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞ü¶ãü§ós
