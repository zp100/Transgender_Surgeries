[EDIT - As I&#39;m all about transparency, the person who originally shared their quote with me double checked the date and &#34;~1 Year Ago&#34; is actually Feb 2018. This is why data quality is important. However, the sheet has been significantly updated in the meantime with lots more quotes which show how prices have shifted over the part 3 years along with almost complete pricing for 2020. I&#39;ll share highlights again in the next few days!]
</p>
<p>
Thank you to those who have shared their FACIALTEAM quotes so far! The sheet is available
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iHLRZiRINCkv835pLaItaiKfxpgEV2eN-KiPals2Gwo/edit?usp=sharing">HERE
</a>
if you&#39;d like to see the base quotes; I&#39;m just citing people as anon/when they received their quote in order to preserve privacy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only had one other recent quotation but it has immediately highlighted that both Forehead reconstruction and Chinplasty + Jaw surgery have been quoted at exactly the same cost, something you might not expect if this was truly personalised. A trend is also becoming apparent in their surgical price increases; the more &#34;necessary&#34; the procedure, the larger the YoY increase. This is obviously totally subjective from woman to woman, but I find it interesting that the only other procedure I was steered towards was Forehead reconstruction (which saw a 56% increase vs a quote last year) when I was primarily enquiring for my Chin/Jaw.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the goal of this? Greater visibility over how pricing is structured, a better understanding of the market and an awareness of when significant price changes come into play. Being &#34;the best&#34; should not mean running roughshod over your customers and the current lack of transparency is only beneficial for providers. We can only do this together though so please do

Brilliant thank you! Can I confirm that that&#39;s the Chinplasty &amp; Jaw surgery, rather than Chinplasty alone? I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s an option. That 5000 price point is a bit of an anomaly.

No, that was for chin alone. They said my jawline really didn&#39;t need any change.
</p>
<p>
For comparison&#39;s sake, my quote from Cardenas was for essentially the same procedures as FT and the total was $15,430 (including 10 nights accommodation).
</p>
<p>
I ended up going to Rolfes in Minnesota for type 3 forehead/brow/hairline (decided to leave the chin alone). It was $10,310. And if I had added chin/jaw work, it would have been $15,128.

Aha, that explains it then! Thank you for the other quotes; do you have any breakdowns similar to FT&#39;s? If not, they&#39;re still incredibly useful for reference; this shouldn&#39;t just to be concerned with FT

So sorry for the necro! I was hoping you could confirm whether the hospital fees included 2 nights room &amp; board? I&#39;ve just had someone provide a quote for 1 night and I didn&#39;t even realise that was a variable!

Thank you! That is totally in line with what other people are being quoted, and not having chinplasty means we might be able to unpick hospital fees too; hospital fees for your 3 procedures come to the same as my quote for Forehead and Chin.

You&#39;re welcome! I was almost able to estimate my exact quote from your spreadsheet, the hospital fees were the only difference.
</p>
<p>
At this point I think it&#39;s possible to get close to the exact quote already, depending on procedures. A little more data and it seems you&#39;ll have it all spot on!

I think there&#39;s probably a baseline regardless of procedure (based on your room and board, reserving an operating theatre, etc.) and then additional hospital fees per procedure, same for anaesthesia.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re getting there, I love progress! And I hate that they don&#39;t just present a table like this on their site for transparency.

The distance between FT&#39;s European unit and Brazilian unit are huge. My quote with the Brazilian unit was so much cheaper than that.
</p>
<p>
I wanted a forehead reconstruction (coronal approach), a rhinoseptoplasty (correction of both the shape of the nose and the septum) and a mentoplasty. All the three together I got a quote of R$ 50.000,00 (in mid 2019) which is about US$ 10.500,00 or about € 9.300,00 today. The quality of the service is basically the same, since it&#39;s the same surgery center.

Jesus that&#39;s insane. Do you mind sharing the breakdown? Ultimately this shouldn&#39;t be limited to FT but it&#39;s totally worth looking at their different units as well

Unfortunately I only have right now the price for the three surgeries together, and the general anaesthesia and surgical materials and hospital fees separated. The anaesthesia was about R$ 2k, hospital fees were about R$ 12k, surgical materials were R$ 4k, and the three surgeries together were R$ 32k, totalling R$ 50k. If I were to guess the price for each procedure, I&#39;d say they were like forehead reconstruction (about R$ 13k),  rhinoseptoplasty  (about R$ 8~9k) and mentoplasty would be about R$ 10~11k.

Those prices are amazing. Here I am in the California and just spent 8,000 on breast augmentation and 2,000 for anesthesiologist with one surgeon and then FFS for a lot more.
</p>
<p>
Traveling abroad sounds extremely cost affective.

Damn, US is too expensive. I&#39;m spending US$ 6.7k for my SRS that will happen in June, being that the final price, anaesthesiologist included. My health plan only covered the hospital fees and hospital staying days, which will be about US$ 2k for 4 nights spent in the hospital.

It&#39;s not true, some doctors have operated in both units and many Brazilian doctors have trained with the Spanish ones. Not like it matters, different doctors can have and many times do have the same standards and quality.

Supply and demand, more trans people, more people wanting surgery.

<p>
I had full FFS for 15K in 2015, now my surgeons prices are 35Kish.

That’s capitalism, go to someone lesser known if that bothers you.

All top name top tier surgeons are going to charge anywhere from 20 to 60K for the “full package” unless you go to someone not well known.

You guys can always go to somebody that does it for less. There is no law that forces you to fly to Marbella.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise you gotta pay topshelf prices for topshelf products.
</p>
<p>
There are many great surgeons out there that deliver great results for a fair price and many people have been made happy.
</p>
<p>
You can publish as many price sheets of FT as you like. As long as the quality and the demand match, the market will just do what it does.
</p>
<p>
That doesn&#39;t mean it is not right to publish their quotes. That is the markets right as much as theirs to call their numbers.
</p>
<p>
But quite honestly: I would rather see everybody fight classism, so we make our local health care systems finally pay for decent FFS that is available to the ones among us with lesser means rather than hating on those that can afford the extra mile. But yeah...

Yes, this is our right to educate ourselves as consumers and make decisions that hopefully promote healthy attitudes from businesses. As opposed to letting them run amok, hiding their prices and jacking up procedure prices in order to recklessly profit from the lack of state support which everyone struggles under and I&#39;m sure does their bit to combat.

You haven’t looked into other top name surgeons if you think facial team is over priced.

Plastic surgery isn’t cheap and you get what you pay for.

I think my comment specifically withheld judgement. My primary issue isn&#39;t the price; my issue is that they make a show of not having prices on site because everything&#39;s so deeply personalised when there&#39;s actually no variation in prodecure price from quote to quote. And a lack of transparency and accountability to your market is what enables dramatic YoY increases.

I wonder if revisions are more expensive or if everything&#39;s always the same. I&#39;ve never had any surgery before and each of my procedures are the same price as everyone else&#39;s this year. I guess someone&#39;s individual bone structure doesn&#39;t make a difference.

My gut would be the same price, given that what they&#39;re starting with doesn&#39;t matter. Maybe even more; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s riskier for them when they start layering on other people&#39;s work.

$20k for FFS sounds about right. i pad 3 times more in the states for one of the more sought after surgeons.

Thank you! Can I confirm on the Lip Lift, as I&#39;ve seen people mention both Lip Lifts (which I&#39;ve seen at 1750-2100€ , depending on whether fees were included) and Lip Augmentation with Fat Transfer (which was 900€ like yours)? It&#39;s possible this price is actually going down but just want to make sure!

So sorry for the necro! I was hoping you could confirm whether the hospital fees included 2 nights room &amp; board? I&#39;ve just had someone provide a quote for 1 night and I didn&#39;t even realise that was a variable!

Hey,
</p>
<p>
Got mine this morning. I went in wanting brow bone, brow lift, and hair advance/transplant. I left the door open to other procedures as I&#39;m pretty happy with the lower half of my face, and Dr Bellinga agreed and suggested leaving it alone (&#34;Every cloud&#34; I guess!)
</p>
<p>
Heres what I got on 22/4:
</p>
<p>
Forehead reconstruction (coronal approach) - €7200 Hospital fees, meds, op theatre res, one night private room - €2650 General anesthesia - €1200 Material costs, CT scan - €1600 Accommodation - €1910 Hair transplant - €7400
</p>
<p>
Total - €21960. (Not including flights or accommodation for my partner)
</p>
<p>
As it stands I&#39;ll be leaving it.  Bellinga was wonderful and I can&#39;t fault their work, but I don&#39;t see my forehead/hairline as a €22k problem. My forehead isn&#39;t
<em>
that
</em>
bad and can be contoured away, and I can work around the minor recession fairly easily by centerparting or having a full/sweeping fringe. Looking at the data you&#39;ve gathered it does appear about as personalised as a blank sheet of paper, which is disappointing.

Thank you so much! This is the first Forehead only I&#39;ve seen and should crack working out the individual procedure fees; I&#39;ve never seen Hair Transplant quoted at anything but 7,400 so I don&#39;t even consider that in anaesthesia/materials/etc.
</p>
<p>
Agreed on that 22k... I went in solely looking at Chinplasty to correct a jaw break, so being quoted for Forehead reconstruction as well irked me. I get the impression they might not even bother unless you want that? Combined with the &#34;unique&#34; pricing structure... You rock a do that works for you instead girl!

No problem! I really struggled finding any sort of pricing, and I stumbled across this thread this morning (typical that it was &#34;after&#34;, but there you go!), so thought I&#39;d add it in so others can brace themselves for the bill without spitting coffee all over their monitor like I did.
</p>
<p>
A side note is that I&#39;ve seen numerous people say in other threads/forums that they won&#39;t perform aesthetic surgery eg: nose jobs
<em>
unless
</em>
it helps feminise the face. This is NOT true. He said I don&#39;t
<em>
need
</em>
to get my forehead done, but if it helps with my confidence it should be considered. So the notion that they only do &#34;feminising surgery&#34; is false.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re looking a lot healthier and happier than you did! We chatted on Birch for a few weeks waaaaaaaaay back when I first started, keep going, you&#39;re doing great 💜

I know, it&#39;s so clandestine! Hope your monitor survived xD That is interesting regarding their criteria for patients though, or I guess I should say lack of.

Omg Birch! I haven&#39;t stepped on those desecrated grounds in a long while now. Thank you though! 😊 You&#39;re looking fantastic yourself; feel free to slide into those DMs for a catch up

Haha don&#39;t worry, thank you so much for sharing! This is super interesting because you don&#39;t have Forehead surgery quoted, might be able to unpick the pricing a little more

What was the reason not to sum up the Hair Transplant as an last row? Was it too much work? As a numbers nerd it annoys the crap out of me that you didn&#39;t do you calc right and just produce a misleading stat.

Because it&#39;s always listed as an optional extra, people aren&#39;t necessarily taking it and I specified Total (Bonework) specifically so it isn&#39;t misleading. And a &#34;Total&#34; still won&#39;t be the total because this is a WIP with multiple procedures still to be added and the Hair Transplant was a last minute addition that I thought people would appreciate seeing, rather than nitpick over it

No it is not nitpicking.
</p>
<p>
You go all the way to produce an excel which is awesome.
</p>
<p>
But then you skip some part and force everybody to do recalculations on their own.
</p>
<p>
While this might sound like a &#34;comfort&#34; issue it is actually exactly the issue of transparency that is tainted because of that.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: Subtotal is a thing
<br>
When doing it: Do it right and transparent.
