I reached out in November/December-ish.
</p>
<p>
Since I was out of state, I scheduled all of the consult appointments in a two day period. Psychiatrist, Social Work and Medical Consult the first day and Surgical Consult the next day. These consults were mid-March
</p>
<p>
A week later I was able to schedule a surgery date after everything was cleared.
</p>
<p>
Surgery was at the beginning of August.
</p>
<p>
Be prepared, Dr. Bella Avanessian will be on maternity leave in Oct/Nov-February if I remember correctly.

You would need to check with Karen or Mount Sinai for exact dates. I just know it was that time frame.

I first reached out to Mt Sinai last September. It took 2-3 weeks for them to get back to me to schedule my 3 intake meetings. I wasn’t able to get those done until mid November due to one of the intake people being out of town. Shortly after my 3rd intake they scheduled my consult for late January. At the consult I sat down with the surgical coordinator to pick a date. They offered me one in May that had opened up, but I still needed hair removal and had several prior commitments over the summer that would have conflicted with my recovery. I’m currently scheduled to go in early October.
