I can&#39;t believe It&#39;s been a whole year since my first GCS operation (5.5 months since the second). I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised, but things are still settling down, slowly changing, and all for the better. I&#39;m still dilating once or twice a week, it is becoming trickier to remember to do it! It takes a while for the depth to return, it&#39;ll be about 14-15cm (5.5-6&#34;) when I start dilating and about 17-18cm when I finish (about 7&#34;).  Orgasms from clitoral stimulation have become easier as time passes. I don&#39;t have penetrative sex with my AFAB partner so any penetration other than dilation isn&#39;t that common. Nice to do every once in a while, but I have to be in the mood!  In spite of the reduction to my clitoris I had in my second op, my clitoris and the area below/between it does still get a bit engorged. Sometimes that&#39;s OK, sometimes it can be a bit sore and make things a bit tight.  It&#39;s still a lot better than it was before the second op though.
</p>
<p>
Healing-wise, I think it&#39;s pretty much there.  I worried about the bottom of the opening tightening up for a while (there was a procedure there to open things up in my second op). Thankfully that seems to have eased off a lot now. I mentioned in my last post there being a bit of a lump in my right labia majora, that&#39;s completely gone now. The canal is still tight and usually needs some extra lubrication for penetration. It does self-lubricate, but only a little until quite late into being aroused... It&#39;s nice when it does happen but it&#39;s normally a bit late - I still need lube! Peeing is pretty normal, any more extreme issues with it going everywhere have settled down, though like with most people, it still happens occasionally.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m really happy with how everything looks and feels and can&#39;t imagine it being any other way. As usual, feel free to ask me anything.

You look amazing!!!!
</p>
<p>
Very cis-appearance!!
</p>
<p>
I bet your clitoris looks entirely natural when you are aroused, given the hooding I can see.
</p>
<p>
Fantastic work!

Hey there, how are you today? Sorry for disturbing you but I noticed you had your surgery with dr schaff. I&#39;m living in Germany and wanted to have surgery with him. Are you happy with your results or do you feel someone else could&#39;ve done better?
