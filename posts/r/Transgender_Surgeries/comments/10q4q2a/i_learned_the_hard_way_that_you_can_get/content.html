<strong>
TL;DR: That&#39;s testicular torsion without any testicles. The spermatic cord from an orchi I had 13 years ago got tangled/pinched with an artery in my inguinal canal while doing yoga, causing the worst pain I have ever experienced.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
First off, what happened to me is a very rare case. The doctors at my hospital told me they had never heard of anything like this happening so if you have an orchi odds are very unlikely this will happen to you, but I figured I should share my experience with the body of knowledge on this subreddit.
</p>
<p>
So, what happened? 13 years ago I had a bilateral orchiectomy with Dr. Tuan Njuyen in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The procedure went normally and healed well. Everything else is intact, I never ended up having GCS. I was grateful to never have to feel testicular pain ever again, but I was wrong!  A couple of weeks ago I did yoga for the first time in years and ended up thinking I pulled a muscle in my groin area. It was uncomfortable but not too bad, I made a joke to my partner about feeling phantom testicle pain like you would with an amputated arm or something. Every day got a little worse and by day 4 I was up all night with sharp pain that would come and go every 15 or so seconds. It felt like someone was squeezing and pulling on a phantom testicle; not as bad as being kicked there, but it would last for hours without stopping. It made me dizzy and nauseous. The longest the pain would stop completely was 30-40 minutes, though if I was lucky enough to get a lull it was normally only for about 5 or 10. Overall, this experience was the worst pain I&#39;ve felt in my life. Bending over or sitting made it worse, and lying down didn&#39;t seem to help. Oddly the least uncomfortable position I could muster seemed to be standing/walking, thought there was still a lot of pain. Maybe gravity helped it, I&#39;m not sure.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I was admitted to the hospital the following day, skipping me ahead of a bunch of people because of the whimpering and clawing at my seat in the lobby. There was swelling in the region above my genitals on the left side that was excruciating to the touch, but doctors couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. They did an ultrasound and bloodwork and ruled out an inguinal hernia, infection of the spermatic tube, and infection of the lymph node, but were still at a loss. By the time the urologist got to me I was in a lull period of my pain and they almost sent me home on low grade painkillers! The searing agony came back in just a time for them to put me on heavy medication and kept me overnight.
</p>
<p>
Once they had the MRI they found that one of my spermatic cords had gotten tangled in the inguinal canal and seemingly pinched with an artery. It then got swollen and stuck there. Physically I still can&#39;t figure out how it happened. Even urologist seemed a little confused. Now, if I had working testicles they would have rushed me straight into surgery, but because I didn&#39;t have to worry about losing one they monitored me for a few days while I got to deal with the pain. Luckily for me, the pain slowly subsided and they decided to send me home with some stronger painkillers. They said they&#39;d perform surgery if it comes back.
</p>
<p>
If I did have surgery, the surgeon would have made an incision in the pelvic region a couple inches above the swelling and snipped the spermatic cord higher up so it could never tangle again. So... if you&#39;re thinking about getting an orchi it couldn&#39;t hurt to ask your surgeon to snip a little higher, right? lol
</p>
<p>
This all happened a week ago and the pain is pretty much gone. Things are back to normal but I&#39;m very concerned about doing the wrong type of physical activity again. I thought yoga was supposed to be one of the safer ones!

Your statement about cutting the cords a little higher up is spot on.    I had a orchie about months prior to GCS.  And when my GCS surgeon finished up he said he had done just that cause they had left too much during my orchie.
