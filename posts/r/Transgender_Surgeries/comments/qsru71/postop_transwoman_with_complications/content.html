Hi, I am a 30 something post-op transwoman and am going through a lot of distressing times right now. My surgery was complicated, due to the fact that the surgeons had to use part of my colon to build the vaginal canal. This is where the complications started. The part of colon they used, would not stay intact, I kept having vaginal protrusions, in which part of the colon would protrude out and cause tremendous pain, I had to undergo countless surgeries to try and correct this issue, which only lasted a few weeks and then start to protrude out again. Eventually, my surgeon had to remove the colon and sew up the vaginal canal. Between surgeries, I only was able to have vaginal sexual intercourse once and even that was painful due to the vaginal protrusions.
</p>
<p>
I do not have a boyfriend at this time, but really do want a satisfying relationship and be intimate, but how is that going to be possible, now that I no longer have a vaginal canal? If anyone has gone through a similar situation or decided to not have GCS or only zero depth vaginoplasty, please respond with some advice or suggestions.
</p>

Thank you Autumn. The surgery didn&#39;t take due to several reasons, I had bladder cancer eight years ago and lost my bladder from the disease, their was nothing for the surgeons to attach the colon to except for scar tissue from the cancer surgery performed. The other reason is that I was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome and so the vaginal tissue stretched too much. I asked my surgeon about skin grafts, but he said that would not work in my case. Their is nothing more the surgeons can do for me now.

I&#39;ve effectively lost my canal due to entirely different complications, with no idea if it can ever be resolved. I never managed to have penetrative sex at all.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, it&#39;s difficult. Lots of anger and resentment. But the thing I keep coming back to is that if I was given the chance to go back to before surgery and just keep my old equipment, I wouldn&#39;t do it.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I can&#39;t have the experiences I want, that I should have, but that was true before my bottom surgery too. Despite not being anywhere near where I want to be, I&#39;m better off than I was, and that&#39;s what I try to remember

I hear you cyronius. I would never go back to where I was before surgery either.  I am sorry you lost your canal as well. It is good to know, I am not the only one. I am trying not to dwell on it,

This is so awful, first of all let me just say I&#39;m sorry for what you&#39;ve gone through.
</p>
<p>
I had complications as well, besides the fact mine didn&#39;t even look like a cis woman&#39;s. This was from a board certified surgeon, and after that I had consults with multiple other surgeons in different states and doctors that told me my results were &#34;normal&#34;. That honestly scares me that this is the standard in the US.
</p>
<p>
It wasn&#39;t until I moved to NY that I learned there&#39;s actual support groups for trans men and women going through surgery issues and lots of them have similar stories. Perhaps you should look into seeing if they have something similar near you? This is the one thing that has helped me come to terms with it.
</p>
<p>
Most trans people don&#39;t get bottom surgery, so it&#39;s hard to find good information about experiences like ours because their usually drowned out by dismissals that what happened to us even happens to people. So please, PM me if you have any questions that you don&#39;t feel comfortable asking/sharing on here.

Is ppv srs an option or is it not possible considering what has happened? I just wanna say that sex isn&#39;t all about dicks going in holes. You can have enjoyable sex without penetration :)

I have had complications(actually to say was totally botched) In almost each surgery, breast( was redone 3 times, rhino 4 times and first srs  when i have been having fever for 2 months and thought i was going to die alone and without anyone support). But these things make us stronger. I have corrected all of those surgeries and even i spemt many years and was working even more hard to earn this money again i don&#39;t regret it. The results i have now are not perfect but much better then used to be and i love my nose, boobs and vagina just The way they are now

Have you thought about peritoneal pull-through correction?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 9 months post-op and had simple penile inversion. I have only 5 inches of depth, so I can only handle mid-sized penises, but my surgeon told me that peritoneal pull-through is still possible if I desire so later on. For now I don&#39;t feel any urge to undergo another surgery, as I&#39;m satisfied with my results and feel like a man worthy of my love and affection will work with what I have.
</p>
<p>
You have a clitoris, labia and I assume sensitive breasts, a mouth and an anus? That&#39;s plenty to derive arousal from for yourself and your partner. Sex is so much more than PIV.

I had to have zero depth because I have ulcerative colitis and am at a much higher risk of fistula. I wish I had an opening, but my partner and I manage.

Thank you everyone for your encouragement and advice. There is a little more to why things became so problematic for me. I am also a cancer survivor, I was diagnosed with T2 high risk muscle evasive bladder cancer five years ago, my bladder was surgically removed, because of my bladder being removed, their was nothing for the surgeons to attach the colon to, except scar tissue from the cancer surgery I had. I have not asked my surgeon about paritoneal .

No Chemical-Cat, their is no fix. I even had a consult with another surgeon for a second opinion and she said their is no resolution to fix it and that I am better off with the way things are. At least my clit and labia was saved.

Im so sorry to hear that. Tbh I know all of us are told about complications but none of us are expecting it to be total failure. Id be devastated. I truly hope something can change for you
</p>
<p>
Ive not had SRS/GRS yet and I couldn&#39;t imagine how id feel after something lile that. Im suprized tho no offer for the peritoneal tho as It was specifically stated to me during a consult it could be used to fix situations just like that. Where the canal fails

I&#39;m not the OP, but I am in a very similar boat to her, and honestly, that just doesn&#39;t do it for me. It&#39;s messy (or takes a lot of planning), dysphoria inducing and just doesn&#39;t feel that great...

I think you would be best served to look at the PPV techniques.  If that fails in the past, surgeons were using grafts from the abdomen, and even foot!!!!

I talked with my current surgeon the other day and asked him about PPV, he said that would not work for me, since I lost my bladder to cancer four years ago, I forgot to mention that to you in my post, I am a bladder cancer survivor, had to have my bladder removed, I had T2 high risk muscle invasive bladder cancer. So....their was nothing for my surgeon to attach the section of colon to, to create the vaginal canal, except for scar tissue from my cancer surgery. I also have Marfans Syndrome, so combined with no bladder and the Marfans Syndrome, I kept having vaginal prolapses, which by the way were extremely painful.  My surgeon informed me that if anything new develops, he would let me know. I will say this, it has put a tremendous toll on me mentally.
