Hey friends quick question. I&#39;m 1.5 years post op with Dr Z and have sent a couple emails in the last couple weeks and just called and left a message today. Has anyone had issues trying to get in touch with the office recently?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking to get my secondary fat injections and a revision done. Possibly breast augmentation if he accepts my PPO plan. Not sure why I can&#39;t get a hold of him even though they were pretty consistent at getting back to me a few months back. I figured maybe covid has given them issues.
</p>
<p>
Any info helpful! :)

Hopefully he finally retired. The trans community deserves better doctors than Zukowksi.

Unfortunately my current insurance (which is no longer starbucks) probably won&#39;t be accepted anywhere else so I have to go back for a revision and fat grafts.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll get my nose fixed and hairline grafts by someone else in the future but I just don&#39;t have the means to go to someone else right now. I went to him for the same reasons you did. Even though I want additional work he did make me consistently pass so I can&#39;t get too upset that I&#39;ll need revisions.

<p>
Sure you can. It&#39;s not unreasonable to expect a surgeon not mess things up. Other surgeons are able to consistently feminize their patients without all the mistakes. As long as we continue to set a low bar for them they&#39;ll continue to deliver substandard results.

<p>
I think you&#39;re taking a big risk by getting on his operating table again.

It&#39;s my only option right now so it&#39;s just how it&#39;s gonna happen. Otherwise I won&#39;t be getting surgery for a couple years.

I understand your desperation and all I&#39;ll say is just think about the position if/when he messes up. Good luck with whatever path you choose. üíï

Sometimes of the year they seem to not all be working.  Try emailing Cole.  He is usually very good about emailing back in short order.
