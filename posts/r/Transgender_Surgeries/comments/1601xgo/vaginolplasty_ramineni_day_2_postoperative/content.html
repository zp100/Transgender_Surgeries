Well, yesterday was interesting. The staff again was lovely üòç  they could have been a bit better with my pain meds early on, but they improved as the day went on.
</p>
<p>
My room stayed to warm till 3am, so between that and Betty White across the way I couldn&#39;t sleep all day, and I was getting very emotional as I&#39;ve been off my estrogen.
</p>
<p>
Was feeling a bit of tingie thingies on my clit, which is off cause it feels really high up at the tip of my glans.
</p>
<p>
Food was awesome. Been eating as much as possible, stocking up on the proteins and vitamin C.
</p>

Katie came in a bit ago to remove the pressure wrap and remarked that everything looked great. The epidural will be coming out soon yeah lots of swelling and a bit of pain upcoming.
</p>
<p>
Waiting on breakfast now ü•∞
</p>
<p>
Update: breakfast was good. The epidural came out, and I had to do a bit of PT. However, walking wasn&#39;t too bad. There&#39;s a balloon in my fupa, but yeah, not too bad.
</p>
