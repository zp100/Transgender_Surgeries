I had my gender reassignment surgery (MtF) last Saturday at Kamol Cosmetic Hospital in Bankgkok (Thailand).
</p>
<p>
Everything went great and contrary to some horror stories here on Reddit, I am incredibly happy that I chose the Kamol Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is incredibly friendly and super professional and I am really more than happy with the current result.
</p>

Congratulations! You should have a very cis appearance, once the swelling, and bruising have healed.

It&#39;s day 4 (post-op) and everything is healing incredibly quickly. The swelling has gone down so much that I can sit on a chair normally and the dark spots on my skin are becoming fewer and fewer.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had a bandage stuck on for two days, but rather a pair of panties with pads and healing creams on them.
</p>
<p>
I can walk, sit, shower, wash my hair normally and feel incredibly happy and liberated.

That&#39;s so amazing, I&#39;m so happy for you. Looking forward to seeing your updates as well! So many nightmares come out of Kamol but it looks like it went great for you

I was unsure at first too.
</p>
<p>
But if you ask the girls here in Bangkok, he is by far the best when it comes to the sigmoid colon technique.
</p>
<p>
Other techniques such as scrotal transplantation inherently involve higher risks because the risk of necrosis is greater. But this is also the case with other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Oh and unfortunately Kamol is not a person of many words - I like that because he is supposed to do his job as a surgeon and he does it well.
</p>
<p>
If I want to talk and am looking for entertainment, I go to the hairdresser and not to a surgeon.

My understanding of Kamol is that a variety of surgeons work on you and maybe not Kamol himself. Maybe for colon he is the only one trained to do that method?

<p>
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
The sigmoid colon method is not a novelty and some surgeons in the world practice these methods.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a little over 2 weeks since I had my surgery.
</p>
<p>
Last week I also had an FFS and VFS done at the Kamol Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Here too, I am once again impressed with how well my surgeries went and how well they are healing.
</p>
<p>
It is indeed true that in large clinics like Kamol Hospital, several teams perform surgeries.
</p>
<p>
This is completely normal and the clinic&#39;s job is to guarantee a certain standard of quality.
</p>
<p>
The doctor-patient relationship is often an exciting thing and especially so with transsexual patients.
</p>
<p>
I studied medicine for two years and have a very well-known hand surgeon in our family.
</p>
<p>
The expectations of such operations are understandably quite high.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the success of such comprehensive interventions does not only depend on the doctor, but also on many individual factors on the patient side.
</p>
<p>
When it was clear to me when I would have my major surgery, I began to consistently prepare my body for this procedure.
</p>
<p>
This may also be a not insignificant part of my healing success.
</p>
<p>
In general, all I can say about the Kamol Clinic is that it is highly recommended if you are looking for a clinic that implements the colon sigmoid technique with an amazingly beautiful vulva.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not saying this because I get special treatment or even money from Kamol for this, but because, unlike many Kamol haters, I can prove this exact result with pictures and I know a lot of girls here who speak just as positively about Kamol like me.
</p>
<p>
By the way - advertising on social media is absolutely nothing reprehensible - or should I stop flying with Emirates just because they advertise everywhere?

Are you getting paid or receiving discounts or any other benefits from Kamol or anyone connected with him?

Absolutely not!
</p>
<p>
I have no financial benefit, nor do I have any other family or business relationship with Kamol.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also not an influencer who would benefit from this.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just a patient who is incredibly happy with Kamol&#39;s results.
</p>
<p>
And also afterwards angry because the negative reports about Kamol made me extremely insecure and in retrospect turned out to be untrue and baseless for me and also for many patients in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
However, there are some things I would never do with Kamol.
</p>
<p>
There are actually big, big problems with the PPV method and I&#39;m glad that I decided on the colon method at short notice based on the advice of a user here on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
For example, I have my breasts and BBL done at another clinic, even though I&#39;m actually happy with Kamol.
</p>
<p>
I decide based on my gut feeling and the doctor&#39;s behavior, so I will have the other operations done in Turkey because I have a better feeling here, for example.

You can&#39;t be &#34;incredibly happy with Kamol&#39;s results.&#34; this early.
</p>
<p>
What you are going through right now I love to call it &#34;The honeymoon phase&#34;
</p>
<p>
Let me hear that again in few months when things heal up and you realize that your urethra might be too low now, that you are not satisfied with the aesthetic.. and more possible complications.
</p>
<p>
I was also happy few month with my surgery there. But later I realized that it&#39;s a whole mess. And it&#39;s not aesthetically pleasing.
</p>
<p>
I went for other surgeons to revise some complications and they saw all the issues.

Hello Lana,
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for your hint.
</p>
<p>
I will of course be happy to continue to monitor this critically.
</p>
<p>
So far - everything has been healing very nicely for a month now.
</p>
<p>
I also take pictures regularly so that I can provide comprehensible evidence of this later.
</p>
<p>
What exactly was the problem with your result?

The strangest moment for me was when I woke up from the anesthesia - everything was dark and I could only hear muffled voices.
</p>
<p>
My body convulsed and trembled with pain, but I quickly heard a voice asking if I was in pain. When I said yes, I was given a strong painkiller and fell asleep again.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the operation was quite easy for my body to bear. I had further operations performed 1.5 weeks after my SRS.
</p>
<p>
BUT - I also continuously prepared my body for these procedures six months before the operation (a lot of exercise (gym and 8km run every day), no alcohol, a healthy protein-rich diet, lots of water and just as much sleep).

The pain is bearable - I would say 2 to 3 as it is severe but only lasts a very short time.
</p>
<p>
In the interest of fairness, I would like to point out that there are some of Kamol&#39;s patients who are apparently not satisfied with the appearance.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I only know such descriptions from individual stories - but I have not yet seen a picture that confirms these visions.
</p>
<p>
Both for me and for a friend from Switzerland, the results are really great and much nicer than what I know from German clinics.
</p>
<p>
I would go to the Kamol Clinic again at any time instead of going to Suporn, for example.
