<p>
Yesterday was my six months vagiversary from getting bottom surgery done at the Suporn Clinic in Thailand with Dr Bank.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, i have nothing negative to say. Yes, the dilation schedule is difficult, and there were some painful dilation sessions, but overall, i have had a great recovery.
</p>
<p>
Not going to put up pictures of my designer vagina (what i like to call my gucci coochie) on the internet for everyone to see, but it looks good, and cis. My labia is a bit fat, but i kind of like that aesthetic (&#39;fat lips&#39;), and overall everything looks great. Scars are faded away to almost nothing, and i haven&#39;t really done much to help that, other than use regular Aveeno moisturizing cream after i shower.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had two UTIs since the surgery, both cleared up really quick with anti-biotics, and i have learned to be much more clean (front to back, never back to front!!!)
</p>
<p>
I was orgasmic with clit stimulation about the 2.5 month mark, and about 3 weeks ago, i figured out i was orgasmic from PIV sex (my fiancee is a pre-op trans woman who was totally okay with using her genitals on me)
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t supposed to drop down to 1x/day dilation until the six month mark, but i did that about 1 month ago, and haven&#39;t lost any depth. My original depth was 7&#34;, and now I&#39;m at 7.25&#34; with the medium dilator (31 mm diameter) and 7&#34; with the large dilator (34 mm)
</p>
<p>
About a week ago, i was finally able to get the orange soul source dilator (38mm) in up to about 6.5&#34;, which I count as a win. That thing is HUGE! Will keep working on that, and see how it goes.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, i am incredibly happy with my choice in surgeons, and most other Suporn girls will say the same. Dr Suporn is retired now, but Dr Bank (&#34;Banksy&#34;) has taken over, and i&#39;m inclined to say he is even better.  Only issue with the Suporn clinic is that it is difficult to get a surgery date due to limited availability, and also, it is entirely out of pocket, as they do not take insurance. Depending on the exchange rate, the rough cost of the surgery is $18-20k USD, plus the stay at the recovery hotel for 3 weeks afterwards, and of course, the flights there and back.
</p>
<p>
I never really thought i had much genital dysphoria, but apparently, i did, as afterwards i realized how much better i felt with that thing gone.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, i am incredibly happy.
</p>
<p>
Happy Six Month Vagiversary To Me!

Yay! I&#39;ve been looking at that clinic for *years*, and I am always so glad to hear from girls who have had a positive experience there!

Sadly, there is no list.
</p>
<p>
They announce a date every four months for four months the next year.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s first come first serve and they run out the second it goes live. So it&#39;s very difficult to get a date.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d start trying asap because it takes most people a few tries.

Thatâ€™s super stressful. Do I have to have all my letters ready to apply? Iâ€™m only at 6 months HRT but want to plan ASAP in case it takes 1-2 yrs for availability. Thanks so much

nope, you only need one letter, and you don&#39;t need it until the actual surgery.
</p>
<p>
the surgery is out of pocket, insurance won&#39;t cover it.

Ok I have a weird private insurance that is designed by my employer and all claims are paid by them. That letter is a relief. I should start ASAP. Thanks so much!!

umm.  you might be surprised.  most insurances want an itemized statement. the Suporn Clinic will not provide an itemized statement, no matter how much you ask, they will only give you the full bill.
</p>
<p>
and they require payment ahead of time, so even if your insurance will cover it somehow, you will have to pay the clinic, and then get reimbursed by your insurance.
</p>
<p>
just make sure you do your research!

No, you can get approved at any time so I&#39;d reach out to them now. Once you&#39;re approved you can try to get a slot when they go live.

I guess in it&#39;s own way it is a kind of anti-establishment art piece.

Thanks for the write up, he is my first choice, just getting the date is so stressful. Did you get it on the first try?
