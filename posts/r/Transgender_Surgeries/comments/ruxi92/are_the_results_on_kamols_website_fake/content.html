I understand you want PPT, but since you are going to Thailand, have you thought about Suporn or Bank at the Suporn clinic. I mean, they are literally among the best GCS surgeons in the world.

(not a shill, just curious)

Yep I definitely considered them, from everything I have read I just don’t think I could handle the recovery and dilation schedule from their skin graft technique. It sounds like hell

Yeah I just can’t take 6 months out of my life to dedicate to recovery and dilation full time in the foreseeable future, especially since all you’re really getting is possibly better aesthetics compared to PPT. I feel like they’re coasting on their laurels a little bit tbh

Yes the recovery and dilation from Chett or Suporn is the roughest of any SRS surgery. Their instructions are for 50mins dilation 3x a day for the first 3-6 months, and then tapering down to once a day at 1 year. But from everything I’ve read the reality is that each session can take 1-2 hours or more due to pain, so you’re kinda dilating all day. One girl told me that she was essentially bed bound for 6 months after her surgery with Suporn, and it was a full year before she got fully back to normal.
</p>
<p>
So it’s kinda luck of the draw. You could get a manageable (but still intense) recovery,  or a hellish 6mo - 1 year. Personally I just can’t take even 3 months off work to recover full time, let alone 6mo.

Yeah it’s unfortunate, because his aesthetic results (which are seperate to his canal method that needs such intense recovery) are some of the best

Follow up question — does anybody know where to find accurate results of Kamol’s work? Because he and Theerapong are my only options for PPT (my preferred method) and Theerapong also seems a bit hit and miss on results (bouncing between incredible and pretty odd).

I&#39;ve seen patients of Kamol who LOVED their results.  I&#39;ve also seen a one or two who had complications and were annoyed.  I wouldn&#39;t&#39; say they were fundamentally unhappy.  But a few people have reported having trouble getting follow-ups with Kamol for questioning.  And the post surgery aftercare being mediocre.
</p>
<p>
I think the pictures on Kamol&#39;s website are legitimate cases that are HIGHLY optimistic.  Very young candidates that scar very little, and recover extremely quickly.  So you SHOULD for any surgeon expect longer healing times, some scaring which can take up to two years to recover (depending on your scar recovery), and potential complications.
</p>
<p>
The best ways to reduce complications are get electrolysis to remove ALL of the hair down stairs, be in good healthy shape before surgery, and pick out a good surgeon.  And I think its fair to say Kamol is a good surgeon.  But he can&#39;t magically affect your base health and recovery any more than another surgeon can.

I checked a few of his images on a forensic analysis tool, it looks like there’s definitely a bit of digital manipulation. It’s not a 100% science so I urge you to check for yourself.

Pretty common for a lot of SRS surgeons tbh. And it’s not completely unheard of for cis women to have labia end above the vagina, but it’s definitely rare

I went to Kamol. You can check my history for pics. I&#39;d say mine isn&#39;t quite as pretty as the ones on his website, but I&#39;m quite happy with the results.

I am also still researching which suregon to pick,  do you mind sharing how much did the PPV with Kamol cost you? Just so I know the ballpark of how much to expect.
</p>
<p>
Wish people shared how much Dr.Theerapong charges for PPT, sigh!

I actually got a quote from their office recently, i just had to send an email to them.  The results on their website look good, but i saw other results on reddit and it did not look good.  I am also 100% intent on ppt but im doubting if its gonna happen.

If you’re going to Theerapong I’d go through Siam Transformative. They’re an aftercare provider that organise everything for you, since Theerapong and Interplast are virtually impossible for westerners to communicate with. They have a full price list on their website

As of now Dr Thee charge 580000 Baht for PPV. That’s not including the aftercare. If you choose to go through Siam transformative, they take care of the aftercare. You can look them up. They are great. As for Dr Kamol the cost is 575000 baht plus the costs for accommodations at KGarden

I had my surgery done with Dr Thee, went with Siam Transformative. I can’t say enough how great they are. I don’t know what I would do without them. They are taking such great care of me before and after surgery. Highly recommended.

According to Theerapong&#39;s website it&#39;s actually 600,000 THB. Not sure how you got 580,000 THB.
</p>
<p>
Also yeah Siam Transformative is very good for talking to and getting questions answered. Now I just have to choose between them and Kamol honestly. It&#39;s more of &#34;Do I want to dilate for the rest of my life with Dr. Thee&#39;s technique, or do I want to live my life without dilation after a year post op?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Both surgeons have great external technique for the vulva. Plus vagina&#39;s vary from person to person so not every vagina is going to be the same externally. It&#39;s just figuring out who is the best.
</p>
<p>
Currently scheduled with Suporn Clinic myself, but I&#39;m going elsewhere because of the severe and intense and very painful recovery from Suporn Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Before I thought Suporn and Chetawut were the only two I had options with for a non-penile inversion surgery because I was denied PPV here in the states due to a medication induced bout of Gastroparesis. I was taken off that medication and I no longer have it but the surgeons here in the states refused to perform that surgery on me. Yet in Thailand they are willing to do it so now that I have that option it&#39;s down to Kamol or Theerapong.

Theerapong charges 600,000 THB, use a converter on google to see how much that is in your local currency.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Kamol quoted me close to what Theerapong charges, but about 15,000 THB less than Theerapong.
</p>
<p>
But here is the thing. Theerapong requires dilation for life with his PPV technique. Kamol only requires a year of dilation and then no more after that. Also with Theerapong and Kamol you get to choose what your labia minora, majora, clitoral hood and clitoris look like. So you need to go looking at porn images of vagina&#39;s on google and find what you want your ideal vulva to look like after everything heals, swelling goes down and such.
