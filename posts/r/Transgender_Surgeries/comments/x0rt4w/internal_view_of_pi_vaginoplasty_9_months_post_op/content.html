<p>
I&#39;m posting this as a factual record of my experience and trying to avoid any preconceived opinions or emotional influence in this main body of text. I hope it helps others in their research.
</p>
<p>
The operation was carried out by Mr James Bellringer at Parkside hospital in November 2021. As per his brief examination no scrotal tissue was required, no electrolosys was required. The donor tissue had not been circumcised.
</p>
<p>
This is an internal view taken using a small plastic speculum and a mobile phone camera.
</p>
<p>
Image one was taken after not douching for approximately 3 months. During this time dilation was performed once a day using OptiLube sterile lubricant and dilators that were washed in antibacterial soap and rinsed prior to use. The white material at the end of the skin tube is dead skin and seems to be a food source for bacteria.  Some of this white material was present on the dilators when they were removed at the end of each dilation session, it has a definite / strong smell that is not pleasant to my nose.
</p>
<p>
Image two shows the skin tube after 1x douching with salt water (300ml warm water with approximately 20g salt added). The white material is no longer present and the smell is mostly gone. This was carried out for three consecutive days and by the third day / douch there was no discernible smell.
</p>
<p>
The difference in colour between the two images is due to the lighting angle as it&#39;s quite difficult to photograph. The skin colour appears to be similar to the donor skin. Pink at the entrance and more red towards the end, this is the same as the penile skin looked pre op from the base of the shaft to the area just below the glands penis. The donor penis was not circumcised. There doesn&#39;t appear to be any real change to skin apart from looking wet as moisture cannot escape the canal.
</p>
<p>
Sensation inside the tube is significantly reduced compared to pre-op. The only sensation felt during dilation is pain at the entrance and internally that cannot be localised except by directly pinching the end of the tube. This occurred accidentally when releasing the angle of the speculum and the tissue was clamped between the jaws.
</p>
<p>
Access to the prostate/ g-spot is possible and sensation remains but at a reduced level. Access is cleaner than pre-op but takes longer and climax can no longer be achieved by direct stimulation.
</p>
<p>
There does not appear to be any mechanism to self clean or lubricate. This is expected as the donor tissue did not have this functionality. It is also my experience that external / synthetic lubrication is required for penetration, even a finger.
</p>

Should have added... Dilation is with Soul Source Blue. It takes approximately 5 minutes to get to depth / last dot is just visible.
</p>
<p>
Impartial part over.........
</p>
<p>
Really not happy with it.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is painful every time.
</p>
<p>
Cannot climax and beleive me I have tried. After 45 minutes internally it is too painful to carry on trying to massage the g-spot no matter how much lube I use.
</p>
<p>
The clitoris is not sensitive. I may as well vibrate my thumb.
</p>
<p>
I have stabbing pain in the labia majora several times a day.
</p>
<p>
Scars are visible and horrific and have formed hard lumps underneath. They are raised and visible when standing with my legs together.
</p>
<p>
Urine leaks out of me throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still in constant pain.
</p>
<p>
If I had the choice I would go back and not get it done, it&#39;s just not good enough. I thought my genitals were awfull pre op but this is significantly worse.
</p>
<p>
Biggest mistake of my life.

Thank you for your honesty. It is curious to see inside canal. There was one comparison with pi, ppt, colon and it appeared ppt has the most identical to natal. Urethra bladder damage is known to happen more commonly with PI. With techniques for ppt, the doctor creates the canal from inside out, rather from outside in.

I have seen that before. Wish the images were clearer if I&#39;m honest.
</p>
<p>
If I could afford it o would have a colon revision but as mine hasn&#39;t failed yet I guess I&#39;m out of luck.

is there any recourse for your issues?

<p>
Is there another doctor that is able to weigh in with your current results?

Over all this is truly horrifying and i am so sad you have to go through this.

There are plastic ones with a built in LED on Amazon, eBay or Ali Express for less than £15. They say single use but with the one i have i can disconnect the light and clean the action end with antibacterial soap.
</p>
<p>
Edit to add. The one i used in the pics did not have a built in light. I bought a new one with the light and it&#39;s much better. The light travels through the plastic and gives a much better view without using to use the falsh on the camera / phone.

Hey girl, thanks so much for your post. I&#39;m seeing Miss Rashid (who trained extensively under Dr Bellringer) in 2 months time (wow that is crazy to say out loud- so soon!) and I&#39;m interested to see how the two of them differ. I also have a close friend going with Dr Bellringer early next year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so sorry for what you&#39;ve been through. I&#39;ve heard similar stories about 75 minute rush jobs. I question how it could possibly be legal.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to. I would like to talk about your experiences more if you&#39;re willing to share.

From my experience Miss Rashid looks after her patients and is careful with them. when I had surgery with her it took between 3 - 4 hours. I was awake throughout it so know she didn&#39;t rush it. it seems Miss Rashid usually has the better results but there could always be complications with any surgery.

both spinal and epidural. I requested it and was the first to do it using that method at the hospital.

That’s so interesting. So your surgeon had never done it on an awake person before? Did she mind you being present? Did you make casual conversation while she worked?
</p>
<p>
Also congratulations! I’m glad you’re happy with your results!!

she does other operations too so she may have had other awake patients for a different operation but I was the first awake one for SRS there. Apart from her asking me if the volume of the music was ok I didn&#39;t speak to her in the operating room. They put a sheet up so I couldn&#39;t see the operation and I just let her get on with the job.  She was talking with other people working in the operating room as they work together.

I made 2 detailed videos about my experience if you want to find out in more detail.

Why are surgeons not called Dr in the UK? They always refer to Miss Rashid or Mr Bellringer. It sounds so dodgy like they&#39;re someone who taught themselves.

It’s a funny leftover tradition from the past when surgeons weren’t doctors at all and closer to what we would consider barbers lol. It’s super weird but it’s kinda cool that we carry on the tradition.

In the UK a consultant gets the title Mr/Ms/Mrs/Miss, so it&#39;s actually a higher level of qualification than Dr.

Dr Bellringer does use the title of Doctor, but Miss Rashid chooses not to. She is a qualified surgeon with a full Doctorate, and could use the title of Dr if she chose to, but she chooses not to for whatever reason.

I&#39;m thinking of gettinga similar op. But my only concern is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
climax can no longer be achieved by direct stimulation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, can you still climax, and if so... how is this done, if you cant do it via direct stimulation?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry if this is a bad question, but I&#39;m GENUINELY confused and concerned.

I cannot climax any more.
</p>
<p>
Pre surgery I was on HRT over 4 years and T was completely blocked with gnrh for the last 12 months pre surgery and I could climax within 5 minutes using a magic wand over my knickers.
</p>
<p>
Post surgery it just doesn&#39;t work any more. The clitoris is not sensitive. I have tried several different vibrators all over the place down there and it just feels like vibrating any other skin like my forearm or something. I can&#39;t even climax with anal any more either it&#39;s horrible.

Do you know if this is a common thing for this sort of op? I hear that sometimes this happens, and you can&#39;t climax for a while due to nerves being damaged, and having to regrow. Do you think this is the case, or had it been too long to think this, now?
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;m sorry if I am asking sensitive questions. I just need to be prepared for if/when this happens to me.

It could be nerves not grown back yet or the pills I&#39;m on after being treated like crap in hospital.
</p>
<p>
Either way it&#39;s crap.

Do yourself a favour and see Bank or Chett etc.

If you&#39;re on an SSRI, that is exactly what happens. Orgasms are nill and IF it happens, it feels like missing the bus. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s just the meds in your case.

If it&#39;s because of the pills them it&#39;s still the surgeon/ hospitals &#39;fault&#39; for not looking after me properly while I was there.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s seriously screwed me up.
</p>
<p>
In comparison I have seen Facial Team treat the operation and recovery just as importantly as eachother. Leaving me in excruciating pain definitely didn&#39;t help and left me feeling abused, hateful and disgusted of the parts that I should love and be proud of.

Not sure if it&#39;s gonna help you, but you could try stimulating the area above your clitoris. That&#39;s where the clitoral nerve would go through and where excess-length of the nerve would be put during surgery since nerves cannot be trimmed. Maybe you can stimulate the nerve with a magic wand there to climax.

The area you mention was extremely swollen post op and the pubes felt like needles snitching into my skin when they grew back so I assumed something was under there. Bloody painful when I hit it on the bathroom sink.... Every bloody time I brush my teeth 😂😂
</p>
<p>
Scratching the area gently with my fingernails does actually feel quite nice, fingers crossed it improves 😁

It is indeed sensitive for me too and I also had one sink encounter 😂 Just start gentle, but it&#39;s a good sign that it feels nice there.

They and others are surgeons who actually know how to do SRS properly and not be a butcher and leave people with a hole huge scaring and constant pain Sadly Trans healthcare is so bad that virtually no one else is available ok NHS in England hence huge waiting lists ever growing

Hey just wanted to chime in with a second opinion and say I had the same penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. Bellringer at Parkside just a couple weeks ago and I have climaxed from indirect clitoral stimulation (with a vibrator through the pubic mound) and from vaginal stimulation (the same vibrator, inside the vaginal canal, wiggling it around to stimulate different parts of the lining). This is just two weeks or so after the operation, it&#39;s still healing and becoming more sensitive and less painful. I still have significant dehiscence which bleeds a lot when I masturbate but doesn&#39;t hurt because horny, and also swelling from a hematoma. But just wanted to share that I had the same operation with the same surgeon and the results were wildly different. Unfortunately it seems to just depend on too many factors to just say &#39;this surgeon is terrible go to X or Y instead&#39; because I am shocked at how sensate and pleasurable my new genitals are and would get this surgery again in a heartbeat. I feel for OP because being able to climax was a huge relief for me and I would have been devastated if I found it wasn&#39;t possible.

This really scares me, I&#39;m in the U.S. sounds like OP is in the U.K.? I&#39;ve only recently been considering SRS and while this is the first bad story I&#39;ve heard this is enough to scare me not to get it.  Is it common for the operation to go so terribly?

Dr.Bellringer has a YouTube video where he mentions that anything other than penile inversion for the canal he has seen failing after some years and has had reports of it too.
</p>
<p>
Really surprised that he even offers peritoneal tbh.

Now that my factual part is over...
</p>
<p>
Bellringer is full of sh1t, he is a complete tw@t and the worse human being I have ever met.
</p>
<p>
I did not mention PPT and I do not think he offers it. He coerces NHS patients to have the fastest &amp;-&amp;&amp; he can get away with and did mine in less than 80 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m having a revision with a different surgeon as externally the result is extremely bad. In fact it&#39;s so bad I&#39;m not posting it on here out of shame.

I don&#39;t disagree but it just seems extremely wrong and nothing like what a doctor would do, in fact that seems to be misinformation and grounds for a lawsuit if he is wrong.
</p>
<p>
I am fine with peritoneal or colon just because i was sadly circumcised and it&#39;s the best option for me even if i need a new canal in 10 years i could care less right now.

This is largely still considered &#34;Cosmetic&#34; or plastique surgery. So advertising law may not be as strict on this sort of thing as it is with what is more commonly accepted to be &#34;medically necessary&#34; stuff.
</p>
<p>
Btw not MY opinion that it&#39;s just cosmetic - I&#39;m talking broadly. Particularly by politicians and such.

I guess I just think about it the way the government does.. they consider ffs cosmetic but in fact it actually saves lives- either that or so little percentage of trans girls get vaginoplasty compared to FFs that they can just get away with saying ffs is cosmetic because it’s often a lot cheaper than vaginoplasty

Yeah, I know they can do wonders with the scrotal skin and I know the results can look awesome either way but I have read so much from surgeons reports and studies regarding depth that I just feel more comfortable opting for the ppt or colon techniques because my circumcision has left me with about 3.5” of skin when reasonably stretched when before circumcision using the same effort I was easily 9 inches

It&#39;s more the entire NHS system being systematically underfunded by the Tories, and the Doctors at the positions of power unwilling to join the 22nd century.  Lots of hidden transphobia as well.

Technically, they can&#39;t because the vaginal walls of the canal are not mucosal.

I&#39;m guessing it looks a lot slicker with moisture and less like an inverted penis. Maybe it would smell a bit nicer as well.

Thought, can you get access from the gray market for Vaginal Estriol Cream?  It might help to promote some change.  I mean it wont make it natal tissue but might help.  I have noted a few surgeons using such.

Thanks for posting, forewarned is forearmed and all that. Sorry to read this and other reports regarding folks experiences with JB. I am with TR in a couple weeks, and just trying to stay busy in the run up to keep it from taking over my mind! The whole incontinence thing is prob at the top of my list of worries for the aftermath. I have had good reports re TR, but that was before she split her time between PS and SG hospitals so hoping the aftercare is still acceptable! I was seriously considering zero-depth but have opted for Vaginoplasty - mainly re keeping my options open going forward.

Urine leakage: you need to be consulting directly with the urologist and a physical therapist for pelvic floor therapy. Until you have started and completed a course of therapy a urologist can give you a prescription for a urethral plug that will keep you from leaking urine. Women who have gone through childbirth are familiar with this. It&#39;s not the end of the world. Welcome to womanhood; I&#39;m wearing a Poise pad right now.
</p>
<p>
Non-sensate clitoris: you still have nerves and erectile tissue buried underneath your mons pubis; it can be surgically excised to the surface if there is scar tissue going over it that is preventing tactile sensation from being felt. Won&#39;t know until you try. And get you some weed and start practicing Kama Sutra because you can orgasm mentally without even touching your clitoris.
</p>
<p>
Smell: you solved your problem. You need to douche after every dilation and every encounter of penetrative intercourse. You do not want to leave the inside of your canal moist because there&#39;s no mucosal tissue there. You do not want flora propagating. I saw another woman here mentioned that she started dilating with coconut oil. Coconut oil is a skin conditioner and that helps improve elasticity. Try this routine.
</p>
<p>
I would start addressing those three issues before addressing any cosmetic revisions with the vulva and labia. You having a whole total freak out and it ain&#39;t even been 2 years.

I have urine leakage for like two years now, using bladder pads day and night. I don’t have a vaginal canal though. I had the vulvoplasty. This is because at first yes I wanted it, but the work place I work at their restroom is across the store where the elevators are so if I peed while in the restaurant kitchen I work in, It’d be really bad. An I wasn’t ready to go full vaginoplasty since I was only 32 at the time - pre-Covid. Had the surgery in October 2019 and then a few months later Covid Pandemic arrived which shut down everything including surgeries which still remain today for the most part. I had gotten used to the dilator for a long time now, but just can’t insert it obviously. Some day I’ll have this done … my vaginoplasty. Until then, I can’t use a kegel to insert in me since I don’t have a vagina yet. If I talk to my provider and say that because my urine leakage is still an issue that by having a vagina would help as being able to use a kegel to help stop/minimize urine leakage?

You don&#39;t need a vagina to utilize a urethral plug.

it&#39;s difficult for you to reach orgasm if you&#39;re obsessed with having it, if you don&#39;t like your result, if it hurts, if you don&#39;t relax it&#39;s impossible for you to reach orgasm, I can even reach orgasm without touching myself, it&#39;s important to be very excited , and not pretending to reach orgasm for having to have it.

The pics are good  wondered what mine would look like inside. I don&#39;t think your case is typical. Whilst I have seen your outcome and understand and you deserve to have them resolved, some aspects are complications that can happen with this surgery. Such as sensation. If you are on anti depressants that can prevent orgasm. I&#39;m fairly happy with my result. Couple minor things but nothing I would bother risk of revision in my case. I can orgasm, no pain. Have same depth as you which is typical for penile inversion so that&#39;s normal. I really hope your revision gives you the peace you deserve but I don&#39;t think its helpful you are posting this stuff under 2 different usernames when its clear same person. You are right to show the not so good but it is creating false impression.

They could orgasm before, so unless they started anti-depressants after the surgery (which is a possibility) this shouldn&#39;t have been an effect.

Edit: What is the other Identity?  Have you reported it to moderators to investigate?

I hope whenever the Covid cure is proven effective on humans then we call can go back to have surgeries and go back to a new normal routine. Most likely will have my inner intestine used for my vagina or if they can create a vagina using another part of human skin to create the vagina will then have to consider that as a surgery option.
