I was hesitant to go in because he&#39;s new and was getting ready to schedule a consult with Ting in NY, but a gynecologist friend is raving about him and he does peritoneal pull-through, plus it would be in my state so it wasn&#39;t a contest.

Hmm.  Since he is a newer doctor, is he open to more experimental procedures beyond PPT?

His nurse whom I spoke with over the phone told me he does penile inversion, sigmoid coloplasty, and peritoneal pull-through. I didn&#39;t ask about anything else, like what did you have in mind? I was going to ask about tunica vaginalis graft when I went in on the 4th.

Huh, I never heard of that one.  Would there be enough material or is this assuming a lab culture grown?  (have a link btw?)

So when they do a tunica graft it only partially covers the depth of the vaginal canal. The benefit of a tunica graft is that the material secretes on excitation, so it provides lubrication by sexual arousal. Women who&#39;ve had enough tunica material report that they don&#39;t need any additional lubrication when having penetrative sex.

Like when I say this gynecologist is &#34;raving&#34; about him, she (Who specializes in trans gynecological care at Eskanazi&#39;s gender health clinic) says that he might be the best in the country already.

I&#39;ve had him work on me, that statement is absurd. He may have the potential to be a good surgeon, but he&#39;s a long way from having the experience he needs.

Good, I went in really prepared and he and his nurse were nice enough.
</p>
<p>
He makes you do a urine flow test and mine was abnormal, so I&#39;m going to come in for a urodynamics test before we can move forward. Not a big deal since I can&#39;t send in my WPATH letters until February anyway, but do be aware that if you piss weird he&#39;s going to halt the process until that urodynamics test is done. He says that any time you mess with the urethra that it can make a bad pisser worse, so he wants to get a look at the layout of why I&#39;m pissing weird before we move forward. He said that regardless of the results, he doesn&#39;t think it will be prohibitive, that as long as I am aware of the risks (He said worse case scenario is that I lose the ability to urinate and would need to be on a catheter for the rest of my life) that he would carry out the procedure.
</p>
<p>
He does require that you are a non-smoker, non-drug user, and they will perform tests in the weeks leading up to the surgery to make sure that you are staying true to that. If you fail one of those tests, the surgery will be canceled. He also requires a BMI under 30.

Actually, I think that&#39;s a brilliant move by hime doing the Urodynamics prior to surgery. He&#39;s spent a lot of time fixing Gallagher&#39;s patients with Urinary issues. I&#39;m sure he wants to avoid all that if possible.

I&#39;ve had three revisions and I have to take meds to pee. I also don&#39;t have any sensation in my Vulva or vaginal canal. This is coming up on 4 years.
</p>
<p>
This was my experience with Gallagher. I deal with this shit everyday.

So I was up to see him on the 22nd because I had an abnormal uroflow test.
</p>
<p>
I have never heard of any other surgeons who perform uroflow before, so I was curious what he was going to do with it. I ran the uroflow twice during my consult on 11/4 and both were abnormal so he wanted to bring me in for a more intense test call a urodynamics test. The first part of the test was ANOTHER uroflow test and again it was abnormal, so he ruled out a one-day fluke, he thinks there&#39;s something wrong down there.  I asked him if it could be prohibitive of surgery and he said no, but that any time you mess with the urethra that you have a chance of making a bad pisser worse so he wanted to know what he was digging into for the best results and care after surgery. Worst case scenario he said was I lose the ability to urinate and would need to be catheterized for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
The urodynamics test was... brutal... Maybe the most painful thing I&#39;ve ever gone through aside from my horrific knee injury. It involves a rectal tube and catheterization. The two radiology techs had trouble catheterizing me and so they brought Roth in to perform the catheterization. He also had trouble with it but he eventually got it in. He said that whatever caused the &#34;hangup&#34; as he called it likely has something to do with whatever is causing the abnormality.
</p>
<p>
During the &#34;hangup&#34; he was extremely pleasant and I felt very safe, like he was genuinely concerned for my comfort.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, after two hours and nearly fainting and a lot of pain, the test was over and he showed conclusively that I have a muscle that is refusing to relax properly during urination. He said that if this muscle doesn&#39;t relax properly, it can lead to problems following surgery with dilation and maintaining depth. He said that luckily, we can go through physical therapy to relax the pelvic floor before surgery to get ahead of the problem now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m ultimately really glad that we did the test and we learned this now, because I hear a lot of women complain about having trouble with dilation and maintaining depth despite keeping a good schedule and I wonder if this has something to do with it.

I have seen his results, but they were only a couple weeks out and there was still quite a bit of bruising and swelling. It wasn&#39;t neat and tidy, but I can&#39;t speculate on the outcome based on the pictures he showed me.
