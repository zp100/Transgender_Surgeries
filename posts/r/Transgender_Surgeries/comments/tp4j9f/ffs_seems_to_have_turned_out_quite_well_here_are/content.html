Good for you! Did you get any nose work done? I&#39;m getting ffs and augmentation done this week and the biggest change I&#39;m expecting is with my nose. I asked my doctor to get aggressive with that huge thing.

Hahah. Ohhhhhhh yes. I had severe previous damage to my nose that was corrected. And then I got it broke again. So he redid my nose too. In his words “Your nose was a serious challenge, there was zero cartilage left…. Only had scar tissue to use to rebuild it and it turned out quite well”
</p>
<p>
And omg I’m so excited for you!!!! It’s so worth it and so rewarding. Good luck to you!!!! You’ll be adding mirrors all over your house. Trust that! 💗💗

Thank you. This makes me so excited and brings tears to my eyes in a good way. I’ve waited for this for so many years.
</p>
<p>
By the way, your doctor did a great job. I hope you can start living a great life.

You’re quite welcome 🥰. That makes me so happy to hear. Don’t let the 1st week or two after surgery get you down… cause you gonna look a hot mess like I did. I get nauseous looking at my early post-op pics 🥴
</p>
<p>
Also too! I forgot…. Idk if this happens to everyone, but my entire face peeled like 3 times. It was like I’d had a chemical peel or something. There is still a few sections on my nose that still need to peel again. But it’s made my skin look fab 😻

Now this is a definition of good FFS work, this is when all that stress and pain we have to go through is worth it. And my god in such a short time, you must heal like crazy.
</p>
<p>
Almost makes me excited to get mine.

Poggers comment😍. Thank you so much for saying that! I am beyond pleased and am shocked how quickly I’ve healed. I never expected it.
</p>
<p>
And you said it perfectly about all the pain…. Not just with surgery, but all of it. Now it’s reward time y’all. 💖💗🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋

It really did turn out fab af! Thank you so much💗💖🦋! I had the following:
</p>
<p>
Rhinoplasty / Septoplasty
</p>
<p>
Cranioplasty
</p>
<p>
Brow lift
</p>
<p>
Lip lift
</p>
<p>
Hairline correction
</p>
<p>
Here are additional benefits that happened for me with all these procedures that I wasn’t expecting.
</p>
<p>
Forehead lines GONE (from constantly raising one or both eyebrows my whole life…gone now)
</p>
<p>
Start of crows feet on sides of eyes, GONE.
</p>
<p>
Frown lines or creases, GONE.
</p>
<p>
Start of little lines around my lips, GONE.
</p>
<p>
Eyes are so much more open now
</p>
<p>
Temples are night and day different, not sunk in now… they are soooooo full and smooth.
</p>
<p>
Aggressiveness of procedures also tightened up my entire face and smoothed it out and gives an extra softness to my look.
</p>
<p>
My smile is completely different and completely perfect (to me)
</p>
<p>
I frown completely differently now and it’s sooooo feminine how I frown.
</p>
<p>
Cheekbones pop like they gonna slap yo momma😆
</p>
<p>
Nose is cute and FUNCTIONAL again. You could drive a boat show up each nostril and they are like flared cute that I love.
</p>
<p>
The Sheryl Crow lip affect. (The one thing I always found most attractive about her) and it makes my bottom lip look pog.

Thanks for the info!  Do you mind writting a small post on my FFS surgeon rating group on facebook?  I put that group up to help others make informed choices based on others experiences:

Thank you very much hun🥰🦋.  I’d love to….. but I terminated my relationship with FB like 5 years ago🤷🏼‍♀️. It was becoming toxic. You are more than welcome to copy paste anything I post on Reddit, for your FB group. Or DM me and I can write something more direct for you, if you’d like.

Awww 🥰
<em>
lovely face
</em>
. That was so appreciated hun. Last Friday…. Ohhh you are pretty fresh out of the oven. That was a very tuff time. Just keep your head very elevated. Like, I am still sleeping on the couch. That way I can elevate my head on it’s arm, with pillows. I really really think that helped a ton.
</p>
<p>
Funny side note here🤦🏼‍♀️. Black thread was used in all the stitches. Under my left nostril it was so tight that the knot embedded into the skin. It created like a moat under the entire nostril that just wasn’t healing near as quickly as the other side. Like night and day. So juuuuust now, I was looking at what I thought was that crusty dead skin scab stuff, that was under the left nostril. Why is this side not 100% healed like the right side?
</p>
<p>
I’ll clean it a little more aggressively with peroxide and a q-tip. Hmmmmm, now that I’ve removed all the dead skin scab flaky stuff….. what’s that?
</p>
<p>
That would be a coiled up white thread that is 10x’s the thickness of the black thread. And it’s threaded from the middle of under left nostril to the knotted side at the end of the “moat” under the nostril.
</p>
<p>
Wtaf!!!!! So I grabbed the knot with tweezers and pulled it out of my skin. Thread was the length of finger from middle knuckle to tip.
</p>
<p>
Well, now ik why this “moat” developed and why it just wouldn’t fill in and heal.
</p>
<p>
And wtf is this thick ass white thread that was obviously used to secure my nose to upper lip skin area. And why the actual F is it still in my nose and how was it missed and why was it used????!!!!  I totes dgaf if it heals up well now. No harm to foul. But I will be nuclear level pissed if this “moat” remains under the nostril after healing up all the way.
</p>
<p>
Moral of story…. Check over your shit constantly. Nobody, including the most gifted surgeons can be perfect. I kept the thread and put it in Tupperware, so I can ask what this is hahahha.
</p>
<p>
Btw, any questions you have.. totally ask if ya like. I’m an open book 🤷🏼‍♀️. DM or here, it’s all peachy.
</p>
<p>
And thank you again for

Thank you so much for the fine advice! That is a strange deal with the gut thread and the black thread both being used. Perhaps they thought it would dissolve away over time and it just wasn&#39;t happening? Or worse - they lost it under the skin and went with a second stitch to secure things into place and got overzealous? That is definitely something to watch for when I go in for rhinoplasty and when I get my black stitches &amp; staples out tomorrow. I&#39;m not looking forward to feeling their absence as painful little holes, but will love not looking like Vickie Frankenstein cobbled together a lady out of available corpses and Abby Normal&#39;s brain. lol

Oh hun, you will feel 10 million times better when that shit gets taken out. Take your pain pills before ya go too. I feel ya on the cobbled together thing. I felt the exact same way too. It was very hard to look in the mirror. I have them everywhere in my house too 😩.
</p>
<p>
And YES, that’s exactly what it was… gut thread. It was as thick as 18 gauge tennis racquet string. I was like wtf is this shit!?
</p>
<p>
What did you have done, if you don’t mind me asking? And do you know if they packed your nose or used plastic insert molds inside your nose? I’ve had both, the many times my nose was
<em>
done
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
You will heal at light speed once that stuff is all out. And remember….Come join the party,  It&#39;s an
<em>
elevation
</em>
&#39;Cause
<em>
laying flat
</em>
just won&#39;t do! 💁🏼‍♀️😆🦋

Oh, that&#39;s alarming.  Were they hoping it would hold a shape while you healed as a coil? WTF?
</p>
<p>
I got my brow buzzed down, they lifted my outer brow a little, advanced my hair line a little, but I don&#39;t see it and they took some material from the procedure to put into my lips, so those are POOFY at the moment.
</p>
<p>
I do sleep on my back, elevated on the couch with lotsa pillows. My kitty helps me sleep lots.
</p>
<p>
In three months, I go back for rhinoplasty and a possible lip fill with fat to make them stay a little poofy.
</p>
<p>
Doing all this where people at work don&#39;t all know I&#39;m trans is a bit weird. Thankfully, only one boob has ever said anything about it and he&#39;s gone now. As a steward, I follow the other trans ladies around my branch and let them know they can talk to me anytime.
</p>
<p>
I will take my pills before going in for staple/silk removal. I&#39;m not driving!

You got that right. I’m not certain tbh. I didn’t call and ask yet. I’m going to wait and see that it heals well and today was like ahhhhmazing for that. I covered it with a truckload of antibiotic ointment yesterday when I removed the
<em>
gut thread
</em>
from the moat area. I just took a shower and washed up well (this includes my hair that I do with serious anxiety that I’ll pull the wrong way and open my healed up incision, but it’s always all good tho🤷🏼‍♀️)
</p>
<p>
The
<em>
moat
</em>
is all filled in and looks fab af. So I’ll just take the
<em>
gut thread
</em>
with me to my next post-op appointment and ask about it. Like I said as long as it heals up, I don’t care a bit. But I will certainly ask about it. Cause what no if I hadn’t noticed it and dug it out????
</p>
<p>
Ohhhh you had wonderful procedures done. I hope they turn out for you. They better, or someone gonna get the board certification slapped out their mouth. I really hope you start to notice great changes once you heal more. That’s prolly what’s up. And
<em>
poofy
</em>
sounds super cute 🥰.
</p>
<p>
I told Doc C to be aggressive as fuck with my procedures. But just don’t mess up my face, like Madge did hers… cause ik where you work dude. 😂

Dr. Liu has been great. Informative, funny and real. I&#39;ll likely post pics when I have a grouping of them to show the healing process.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of funny - you are hilarious! 😂
</p>
<p>
I will wash my hair again tomorrow morning and even with stitches in, I fear opening up the wounds. No scars, please! I like my undercut! Dr. Liu was concerned because he said I&#39;m the only person he&#39;s worked on who has hair as short as mine is, going into surgery. When I told my mom that I am going to get rainbow Hermes&#39; wings tattoos starting at my scalp scars, she totally flipped out, so I lost it. Check giving mom a heart attack about queer tattoos off the bucket list. lol

Ha! Good for you with the tattoos!!!! That sounds fabulous af. And thank you btw for the compliment, I’m a little snarky 😏
</p>
<p>
You have an undercut???? I wore an undercut since I was 12, until I grew it out just a few years ago. I loved it, especially freshly buzzed down. I used a 1/32 or sometimes just with the slider on the clippers up just a tad.
</p>
<p>
I think all the scabbing is out of my scalp now…. But idk, cause I’m too timid to divide up my hair yet and examine it. I’ll do it in a few weeks more when Ik for certain I can’t get stupid and pull it apart like warm bread 🫣
</p>
<p>
I mean Ik it won’t do that now… but I’m paranoid because my hair is my strength 🤫
