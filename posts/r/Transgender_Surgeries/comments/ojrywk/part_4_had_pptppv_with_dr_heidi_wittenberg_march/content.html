Red on internal tissue continues to improve but the white in the vaginal canal looks worse.  I&#39;m not sure what causes that.
</p>
<p>
Since dilation has been pretty easy the last week I tried skipping my night dilation yesterday and that was a bad idea.  It was significantly harder to get the dilator in this morning and more painful than it&#39;s been in the last couple weeks.  It was also sore when I was done and still is slightly a few hours later.
</p>
<p>
A lot of times I can get up and walk without noting any pain and other times I still have to force my legs together for a minute till the pain disappears.  It&#39;s never too bad, though.  My labia majora scars still hurt a bit to touch but the labia themselves generally don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
Five days ago I was out all day again, drove a couple hours, sat in a recliner seat at a movie with almost no pain the whole time.  All the activity may have caused swelling because when I sat to pee, it tried to spray forward again.  I found that closing my legs helped it not spray.  Like the last few times, I only had to pee once when out all day.
</p>
<p>
Four days ago green slime showed up at the base of the slit instead of the top of it, and it looks more yellow.  It really looks like mucus but I keep wondering what could be making mucus?  As far as I know, the only skin that can even make mucus is the urethra, and that usually indicates an infection which should bring pain while peeing but there isn&#39;t any.  So what the heck, slime?
</p>

</p>
<p>
The same day I found the balloon on my douche ripped after I filled it:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/tam7cfilc2b71.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59af1ec0e426c474fb7e28a4debdb137013e69ff">https://preview.redd.it/tam7cfilc2b71.png?width=1446&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59af1ec0e426c474fb7e28a4debdb137013e69ff</a>
</p>
<p>
I tried to hold the tear closed and use it anyway but it didn&#39;t feel like much fluid actually went where it was supposed to.  I later rolled the lip of the balloon over the tear and that managed to hold it well enough to use it again, but you can see how cracked the lip is getting so it&#39;s not going to last much longer.  In hindsight it might have lasted longer if I removed the balloon from the white plastic after each use.
</p>
<p>
But it&#39;s really maddening how everything these days is designed to fail in a year or less.  People praise these things for only costing $6 so you can buy another when it fails but nobody thinks about how much waste that generates, including the box and packaging and useless carrying pouch each one comes with.  Of course the company doesn&#39;t sell sets of balloons, so it&#39;s a new white plastic piece and pouch to throw away each time as well.  I was reading old reviews that said the balloon used to last for years and now it lasts a few months.  Plus the material now sticks to itself and I have to spend a few minutes carefully pulling it open enough to fill each time.  Rinsing it out with soap after each use did not help.  Old reviews said the balloon didn&#39;t stick.
</p>
<p>
So I spent a few hours trying to find a better alternative and everything has bad reviews saying it fails quickly.  The only thing I found with some promise is a $40 device from the UK but I need to research it further.
</p>
<p>
Three days ago I tried using my vibrator in the middle of the day instead of immediately after dilation.  I lubed with thin KY Water instead of thick KY Jelly and it managed to go in to full depth after 5 mins or less with little discomfort.  It does feel like the vibration stimulates release of transudate lubricant so I&#39;m not sure how well using KY Water on a dilation would work.  But I climaxed in 17 mins and sensitivity seemed a little better than last time I tried.  The orgasm was subdued but satisfying.  Seems it&#39;s still true that spending more time leads to stronger climax.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I removed the silicone tape over belly sutures:

<p>
I can&#39;t say I&#39;m all that impressed with how they&#39;re healing but I guess it&#39;s good they look like discolored skin more than scars.  The belly button scar seems significantly darker so presumably they&#39;d all be darker without the tape, though I can&#39;t be sure.  I think I&#39;m going to leave the tape off for awhile and rub them daily with &#34;Botanic Tree Stretch Mark + Scars + Prevention&#34; cream which I&#39;ve found in the past works well to reduce stretch marks on me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been trying to sleep on my side for a full night but I always wake with my legs aching a bit like circulation is poor and I have to move to my back.  I never had this problem before surgery so I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s a problem now.  I know I used to sleep with just a blanket between my knees but I still get the leg aches when I do that now.  Hopefully it resolves in time.

Oh my, what happened?!  All the discoloration was caused by my getting laser hair removal three days ago.  The laser heats melanin in the dark hairs and that heat burns the hair follicle.  It also heats melanin in the skin when you have freckles or darker patches, which left some speckled, burned areas.  This might seem like a bad idea, but once it heals the melanin tends to permanently fade or disappear, so you end up with a more even skin tone, which I prefer.  I had the same treatment from the same provider on my legs and arms a couple years ago and it got rid of a lot of the freckles, along with the dark hair (some of which returns due to growth cycles but a significant amount never came back).  The burning above does seem a little worse than when I did arms and legs but I saw the provider again today and she said it will heal fine.
</p>
<p>
A lot of women will want only some of the hair removed, perhaps leaving enough to cover the scar lines, but I&#39;m weird and want it all gone.  Laser treatment works best with hair shaved as short as possible so I shaved as much of the hair as I could and rinsed deeply with a removable shower nozzle which prevented leaving cut hairs everywhere to stick to the dilator like last time.  Here&#39;s what it looked like before treatment and immediately after treatment:

</p>
<p>
My usual driver had a stomach bug and couldn&#39;t take me so I drove myself over an hour.  I felt almost no pain, partly thanks to applying 2.5% lidocaine, 2.5% prilocaine cream before I left.  The treatment itself was not too painful but a few minutes after I got up the soreness really hit me.  When I sat in the car, it got pretty bad, maybe a 4/10.  I decided to go back in and ask for ice which I&#39;d foolishly forgotten.  They gave me some but applying it only dulled the pain a little and quickly made it feel like I was getting frostbite.
</p>
<p>
So I had to just bear it.  After 45 mins or more, pain was finally down to around 1/10.  I made it home and for the next two days I was a lot more sore than usual.  It hurt too much to lay on my side, walking hurt, sitting hurt, bending hurt...  I had this same laser treatment done to my genitals in late 2019 in an attempt to reduce how much electrolysis I would need, and I don&#39;t remember much soreness at all during healing, so I wasn&#39;t expecting recovery to take so long.  I&#39;m pretty sure she used higher power settings this time, probably because the hair was much thinner than last time.  When done properly, power is increased during each treatment to catch lighter and thinner hairs.  You can&#39;t do the first treatment at full power because the density of the dark hair will cause too much pain.
</p>
<p>
As of today, things have been feeling almost back to how they were before treatment.  I did some driving and sitting and walking without too much issue.  Last night I slept on my side but I only lasted a couple hours before feeling I needed to be on my back.
</p>
<p>
It looks like all the sutures have finally broken off towards the bottom but there are still bumps where some of them are.  I used to sometimes catch my nail on two of them painfully when I cleaned but I noticed the catching had gotten much better a few days ago since it&#39;s now more bumps than wires.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I tried putting silicone tape on the labia scars again but decided it hurt too much after an hour or two so I removed it.  I&#39;ve decided to try to put the scar healing cream on it daily instead.  I really should have started doing that a month or so ago but it&#39;s only stopped hurting to touch the last couple weeks.  Or, rather, sometimes it doesn&#39;t hurt and other times it&#39;s like a 2/10.  It&#39;s very odd how it can vary so much.
</p>
<p>
Dilation continues to grow easier.  I generally get the orange dilator in to full depth in 2-3 mins, and yesterday I saw the last dot on the purple dilator fully disappear for the first time.  Unfortunately I still have another 1.5-2 inches to go before the purple will be as deep as the orange, and I&#39;ll have to keep starting with orange until getting the purple to full depth becomes easy.
</p>
<p>
Someone asked me in chat what to do if you can&#39;t get the dilator to go in at all, so I&#39;ll share what I told her:   Swelling and the weird way skin folds while healing can make insertion difficult for awhile. There were times where I was pushing against an indent that wasn&#39;t actually the hole. Usually if you get the tip into the slit, then slide the tip towards your rear end as far as it will go, you&#39;ll be in the right place. It can still feel like there isn&#39;t a hole there but if you relax and just keep pushing (make sure it&#39;s lubricated) it will go in in a couple mins. I think it also helps to spread your legs just the right amount. Too far spread and you pull muscles tight that will clamp the vaginal canal closed at the top and bottom. Not spread enough and you&#39;ll clamp the canal closed from the sides. So try opening and closing your legs till you feel the least pressure against the dilator.

</p>
<p>
As of a few days ago, pain is back down to the low levels it was at before my laser hair treatment.  I can walk and move without much discomfort, but it&#39;s still not entirely pain free, especially with my legs fully together.  Some of the darker areas burned by laser treatment are starting to look better than before treatment, at least to my eye, but we&#39;ll have to wait till the remaining dark spots fully heal to be sure.  A lot of the hair sticking out 2-3mm are actually dead and can be pulled out with no resistance.  Once pulled, the ends look dry and pointy instead of having the wet gelatinous bulb or sheath of a living hair.  They should fall out on their own within 1-2 more weeks.
</p>
<p>
A couple days ago I noticed the spot at the bottom of the slit I used to catch my nail on while soaping is no longer catching my nail, so the sutures are fiiiinally close to disappearing enough to stop causing issues.  I&#39;ve also been rubbing the main scar lines with scar-healing cream daily for at least the last week, along with my belly scars.  Yet looking at the belly scars images compared to the last batch, they all seem a bit darker and the second one has gotten a red spot in it.  I know that until scars have healed really well, light can darken them, so I think I&#39;ll put the silicone tape back on for awhile.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/gpevuf6loud71.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a1f9f499a99354f0226835ef944e6a64ef6ac9">https://preview.redd.it/gpevuf6loud71.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73a1f9f499a99354f0226835ef944e6a64ef6ac9</a>
</p>
<p>
I had a new record of 7 mins to orgasm and it was more intense than my previous orgasm.  Before I started estrogen, I probably masturbated at least 6 times a week on average.  After estrogen that tapered off slowly to once or twice a week.  And since 3-months post op it&#39;s been 1-3 times per month even though I resumed progesterone.  In some ways I&#39;m still nervous to touch myself because I&#39;ve gotten so used to it causing pain, but mostly I just can&#39;t be bothered and would rather do other things.  I did have one interesting experience a couple days ago doing &#34;sexting&#34; online and I got aroused enough that it felt really good just to clench the muscles down there without even touching myself.  I reached a point where it almost felt like a slight orgasm.  I find it kind of nice to be able to experience pleasure like that without needing to have a full orgasm or touch myself.
</p>
<p>
Since my balloon douche is going to fail at any time, I bought two alternatives.  The first is a simple 300ml syringe
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T7MN36N">that costs $11</a>
:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/rn6bs32agud71.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70e2ce202ed4cec408ca46626567fd503dfd274b">https://preview.redd.it/rn6bs32agud71.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70e2ce202ed4cec408ca46626567fd503dfd274b</a>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t come with the douche nozzle or the clamp to stop water leaking out the nozzle till you&#39;re ready.  I had to steal those from a
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B008DEZEZQ">$20 enema kit</a>
I already had.  Technically you could just buy an enema kit for douching and it would probably be better than the plunger.  But the enema bag needs to be hung from a high point and I&#39;m fairly sure the weight of hanging water from the small hook will eventually tear through the bag.  But I could be wrong.  I&#39;ve had the kit since 2014 and rarely used it and never used the douche nozzle that came with it.  The bag never stuck to itself or smelled bad and still seems in good condition.  Of course, quality may have gone down since then.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m not too pleased with how bad the plunger smells even after washing twice. The black part of the plunger has a bit of oil on it to keep the seal but I feel like it&#39;s the translucent plastic of the syringe body releasing the bad smell.  I read you can use vegetable oil on the plunger once the oil it comes with runs out.  I still don&#39;t know how long the plunger could last with regular use.  Squirting any type of oil inside you also doesn&#39;t seem like the best idea but I would think the tiny amount that is released each time should make it a non issue, but I could be wrong.  Still, it&#39;s another reason to think the gravity feed of the enema bag would be a better solution.
</p>
<p>
Before stealing the nozzle from the enema kit, I tried using the nozzle from the balloon kit but it mostly squirted out between tube and nozzle instead of going in me.  Once I switched nozzles, it worked well enough but I find the whole thing pretty bulky and annoying to use. You can&#39;t put the plunger in without squirting out some liquid or holding them separated till the nozzle is inside you which is an awkward process. Pushing the plunger with one hand while holding the nozzle inside with the other hand is also awkward because you basically have to push the plunger with your belly or side until it&#39;s almost fully depressed and then you can push it with your thumb while holding the base with index and middle fingers.
</p>
<p>
After the syringe, I tried the Bathmate Hydro Rocket:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/me3ojcaejud71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e28be64b7549773c50ad4bbe59fd3437522437">https://preview.redd.it/me3ojcaejud71.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e28be64b7549773c50ad4bbe59fd3437522437</a>
</p>
<p>
The box and manual say this device is manufactured in the UK which I definitely trust more than the cheaper versions you can get from China.  I originally found it for $45
<a href="https://enemasupply.com/products/rocket-shower-douche-11-ounces">here</a>
but I found the same thing for
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0778NCB8C">$30 on Amazon</a>
.  I can tell they&#39;re the same because when I zoom in on the UK listing I can see the little tag near the suction cup says &#34;bathmate&#34; which is the same as the one I got.
</p>
<p>
The nozzle on the rocket douche is much thinner than the nozzle on the balloon douche.  You&#39;d think that would make insertion easier but it hurt slightly on my first insert and I suspect that&#39;s because the end isn&#39;t as rounded.  So I don&#39;t recommend using a nozzle like this until you&#39;re well healed.  The nozzle is 33% shorter than the balloon nozzle but the fact it sprays upward instead of to the side should make it deliver liquid at least as deep, if not deeper.

The base of the nozzle has a one-way valve but if you let the rocket&#39;s bulb expand it will pull air in past the valve anyway, so I think the valve is useless except maybe to prevent backflow from a slight reduction of squeezing the bulb.  I did find that once the bulb is squeezed mostly flat it stays that way without much pressure so you can remove it, rinse the nozzle, and remove the nozzle before you let the bulb expand.  The valve makes the nozzle inside harder to clean but you can fill the bulb with some water and squeeze it out of the nozzle without fully inserting the nozzle base.
</p>
<p>
The rocket bulb holds exactly 1.5 cups of water, the same amount I used with the balloon douche, but that doesn&#39;t leave room for hydrogen peroxide or the base of the nozzle.  So instead of measuring water, you can fill it up most of the way, then add slightly less than 1.5 tbsp hydrogen peroxide and close it.  The opening on the bulb is slightly wider than the balloon&#39;s opening so it&#39;s slightly easier to fill.  The bulb can also stand on its base if you need to set it down while filled so that&#39;s a nice feature.
</p>
<p>
The first page of the manual says &#34;The Bathmate Hydro Rocket has been designed and manufactured using skin-safe and/or medical grade materials&#34; and &#34;is designed to provide many years of trouble free use.&#34;  However, the inside of the bulb has a slight rubbery smell which makes me think it&#39;s not made of the highest quality materials which shouldn&#39;t outgas any odor.  Think of sex toys - they don&#39;t smell.  Still, it&#39;s got to be safer than the syringe that stinks or the balloon that lasted 4 months and always stuck to itself.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;ll probably stick with the rocket douche because it&#39;s smaller, easier to fill, easier to use, and doesn&#39;t smell as bad as the syringe.  I also think it will last longer but only time will tell.  Some of the reviews of the syringe mentioned it can crack if it falls on a hard surface.  The rocket bulb will certainly not crack but it&#39;s possible the nozzle could crack.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I went looking to see if Bathmate sold a rounded, sideways-spraying nozzle for the hydro rocket and discovered hydro rocket disappeared from bathmate&#39;s
<a href="https://bathmatedirect.com/collections/all-accessories">accessories page</a>
sometime after
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180826193710/http://bathmatedirect.com/collections/all-accessories">Aug 2018</a>
and the
<a href="https://bathmatedirect.com/collections/all-accessories/products/hydro-rocket">direct link</a>
to the product is gone.  So I suspect what can be found on various other online stores are the final available stock of the product.  Sad.  On the plus side, if these were manufactured in 2018 and the bulbs aren&#39;t cracking 3 years later, that bodes well for them surviving a long time.
</p>
<p>
For those still healing, I think the enema kit with the sideways-spraying nozzle is your best choice and will probably last a long time if quality hasn&#39;t gone down since 2014 (though sadly, it probably has).  Another product you could try is
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/OTBBA-Enema-kit-Lubricant-Certificate/dp/B07PT6732K">this</a>
which claims to be made of silicone but because of some reviews saying it smells horrendous and the grammar mistakes throughout the listing, I doubt it&#39;s actually silicone.  The other reason I skipped it is some reviews said the nozzle was too soft and I can tell from the pictures it&#39;s significantly thicker than the balloon douche nozzle so I don&#39;t trust it would be easy to get in, especially for those earlier in the healing process.

Dilation continues to be pretty easy at twice per day.  I was able to reduce KY Jelly about 20% so there&#39;s less to wash off after.  I think I may have got the purple dilator to full depth as of yesterday.  At least I felt a slight twinge I sometimes get when the orange dilator hits bottom but I&#39;m not absolutely sure.  Annoyingly, the finger indent on the purple dilator is cut significantly farther from the tip than it&#39;s cut on the orange dilator so my usual reference point is different.  I guess I have to try marking the same point with a permanent marker but I&#39;m worried it will wash off.
</p>
<p>
4-5 days ago, my back started hurting when I lay on my back and made me wonder if laying on my side more to sleep is causing that pain.  I tried stretching out more on my side (less curled forward) and it might have helped, though I think the pain was more likely related to what I was eating for awhile because my neck was also stiff and easily hurt.
</p>
<p>
The ache in my legs like there&#39;s not enough blood flow when I sleep on my side has been improving the last week.  I assume it&#39;s improving just from practice, or maybe swelling continues to reduce on inner thighs and that improves circulation.  Last night I found using a very thin pillow (2&#34; thick uncompressed) between my knees was the most comfortable and it was the first time I&#39;d slept on my side the entire night and I only woke 2-3 times to rotate.  I had tried the thin pillow a few weeks ago but it wasn&#39;t nearly as comfortable back then.

Thank you so much! You are the bottom surgery bible! I am 3 months post op but I haven’t seen my clitoris yet. There’s fibrous tissue on top of it and I still need it to slough off. How do you take photos of your clitoris like that? I try to spread my legs as far apart as possible but my labia minora won’t open up

I set a headlight on the floor pointing straight up and use a mirror to see my loins in the light, then I spread my feet as wide as possible and squat as low as possible.  This pulls everything open and I shift position a little and use the mirror to watch for where it opens as much as possible.  Then I use a phone camera to take a photo.  I can&#39;t see the phone screen to aim the shot but I&#39;ve used it enough that way to aim it fairly well without seeing the screen.  Taking shots with the camera farther forward and farther back gives you different angles to see different things.  Lately I&#39;ve been showing shots with it forward to show the vaginal canal entrance.

Heh. The greyer circle is the clit constructed from the top third of the head of the penis and it&#39;s two pieces sewn together which is what creates the jagged line down the middle. I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s done this way but the doctor said it should smooth out in time.  I suspect it&#39;s a little larger than average for a cis-female but I could be wrong and it&#39;s definitely not beyond the standard range of sizes.

I&#39;m good.  For sizing up, follow instructions in the video &#34;Sizing Up Your Dilator with Megan McCaleb, PA-C&#34; towards the bottom left of
<a href="https://www.mozaiccare.net/videos" rel="nofollow">https://www.mozaiccare.net/videos</a>
</p>
<p>
Personally, I would not start using a larger dilator if the smaller one is causing any significant pain or any bleeding.  I also just found
<a href="https://www.susans.org/forums/index.php/topic,244637.msg2226621.html#msg2226621" rel="nofollow">this post</a>
in my notes which says &#34;As I am the very first one to have this done in my country, we have been establishing a protocol with my doctors based on my case. We&#39;ve concluded that the best kind of dilator for this procedure is silicone, the peritoneum is quite fragile and doesn&#39;t require all that much dilatation. It becomes less fragile over time as it begins to morph into something ressembling vaginal tissue, but for those first 3 months, silicone dilators are very comfortable, less risky and dilate you more than enough. Do bring this up with your doc of course!&#34;
</p>
<p>
So this implies the hard dilators are more risky than softer ones and that might be a reason not to try dilating up till at least 3 months.  Then again, if hard dilators or early dilation were injuring people, I think Dr. Wittenberg would have evidence to change the policy by now.  But it&#39;s up to you how cautious you want to be.
</p>
<p>
The only tip I can think of that isn&#39;t in the video is to hold the longer and shorter dilators so their tips are against a wall, then use a white paint marker or permanent marker to mark the same spot on both of them where your target depth is.  This is assuming you get them deeper than the white dots on both dilators, and I think most PPTV patients will get them deeper than the dots.

Huh.  I&#39;ve actually been spinning the dilators 360 degrees to spread the lubricant evenly pretty much from day 1 and it never obviously caused problems despite the bend in the tip.  But maybe it slowed healing and I didn&#39;t know it?  I feel like the bend is going to make things shift significantly internally as you insert it even if you don&#39;t rotate it.

Yes, both dilators go deeper than the white dots.  I&#39;ll show a picture with my update today.

I mean, PPTV often results in depths greater than 16cm and that&#39;s beyond the white dots.  But 13cm is the middle of the second to last dot (last dot is ~14.2cm) and that&#39;s the traditional goal for depth and at least as deep as the average cis vagina can stretch.
</p>
<p>
Are you using the thin purple dilator (thinner than the orange) or the thick purple (thicker than the orange)?
