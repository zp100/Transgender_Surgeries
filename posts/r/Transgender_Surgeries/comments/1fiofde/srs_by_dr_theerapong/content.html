Someone asked for my experience with Dr Theerapong and I spent a whole lunch break writing a response, so here it is. I&#39;ll edit it later and add pics. Ask questions and I&#39;ll answer :)
</p>
<p>
Hey!
</p>
<p>
He has a handful of different agents so your non-surgical experience may vary. You need an agent, take the nursing care options for all the time. Having a partner is not a substitute for a nurse imo (even though it would have been so much harder without the emotional and physical support).
</p>
<p>
The surgery was THB 600k, which included 7 nights in the hospital, all expenses in the hospital, meds for the next 30 days, and dilators. Care packages, accommodation, etc are all extra and handled by your agent.
</p>
<p>
Everyone stresses how important it is to not do drugs, drink excessively, or smoke for the last month before surgery. If go further and say quit it all and get as fit as you can cause you want to be in the best shape possible. Nicotine hurts healing and the sooner you can stop using the better. It&#39;s a once in a lifetime surgery with any luck, don&#39;t fuck it up. I had an absolute golden run on my recovery and in contrast there was an American who was a heavy smoker, drinker, and user before she came over - and was there for 3 months in recovery. Some is lifestyle, some is just the genetic lottery.
</p>
<p>
I flew in, went to a hotel, went to the local psych for the required psych assessment (easy), then pre-consult with Dr T. He&#39;s a quietly spoken man, asked a couple questions about why surgery and why PPV not colon, and asked if I had any questions. Be prepared with questions, he will answer them but does not elaborate much. It was my first time talking to him. He&#39;s very proud of his work with making clitoral hoods - it&#39;s good work and when you&#39;ve seen a well constructed one you&#39;ll start to notice how many neovaginas are lacking one.
</p>
<p>
Slept, then next day checked in to the hospital. Fluids only ~24hrs before surgery. Food was pretty ordinary. the hospital isn&#39;t anything exciting, but it&#39;s not terrible. Take a Chromecast as the TVs are Thai only.
</p>
<p>
Surgery is late - rolled me in in the evening and put me under. Came out 0300. Minimal pain when I woke up the next day. Horizontal for 7 days, minimal movement for the first 3 or so. If the bed feels uncomfortable when you first get in it, let them know as I developed a bed sore from the thin mattress (~82kg 5&#39;10&#34;). Nursing care is decent, they come when you buzz to administer painkillers. Sponge bath each morning. Nil by oral for a few days then fluids.
</p>
<p>
The hospital stay is fine, I went a little stir crazy cause I like being up and about. Having a partner with me was a big plus as the nursing staff speak minimal english.  Dr T visits most nights after surgery (he does 1 a day most days), so you will be woken up late for a check in. packing and catheter stays in for the week. It&#39;s better, I think, than getting up and about - less risk of opening up wounds. It left me substantially weaker than I was before, but I&#39;ve had only 1 minor bleed in the ~4mo since surgery.
</p>
<p>
After a week we were released to a hotel, which was fine. Dilating started as soon as I was out of hospital, twice a day with nurse assistance. He gives wax candles, but you can buy glass ones from Interplast later. The wax is kinda good as my body bent it a bit. I started walking again when back in the hotel, 15min twice a day. It was tough at first but got better quickly. Make sure you have a GOOD doughnut pillow before you go to TH. If you&#39;re in AU I&#39;ll send you a link.
</p>
<p>
I had to pay for materials on top of nursing care. Don&#39;t go with an empty bank account, but it&#39;s a pretty cheap place.
</p>
<p>
Because the nurse cleans on the bed after dilation, the need to shower was minimal, which was good cause I was pretty week.
</p>
<p>
I had 10 sessions of hyperbaric chamber treatment. It was absolutely worth it. It was the only time that I was entirely free of discomfort while I was there.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics at first - everything was super inflated, looked not exceptional, urethra and clit was massively swollen and it made everything really tender and peeing went EVERYWHERE. It settled down over 2 months.
</p>
<p>
4th week we went out to Paragon (big shops). I took a wheelchair, which was a good idea.
</p>
<p>
I stayed in Thailand (Bangkok) for 33 days total. I don&#39;t like Bangkok particularly but I had to stay as my partner needed to work 3 weeks in the city (international company, big plus). Thai people as a whole are very polite, it was just ungodly hot and humid and too much durian smell - but I wasn&#39;t there for the weather, so it really didn&#39;t matter.
</p>
<p>
If you intend to stay longer than 30 days, you should contact their immigration to extend your visa. Extension for 30 days is 900 baht, overstay is 500 baht a day.
</p>
<p>
Air Asia is shithouse and cancelled both of my flights. We had to book Air Thai last minute and they were good. You will want wheelchair service in the airport, they require a doctor&#39;s note dated 3 days or less from departure.
</p>
<p>
Dilate twice a day 30 min douche afterwards with Betadine. I get a generic from Amazon, it&#39;s cheap enough.
</p>
<p>
I have had no dehesience or major issues. I have had one internal bleed that stopped in 20 minutes - it was bright red so was scary, but relatively minor. I&#39;ve had some odour issues - some dead skin cells were building up at the base of my vag, gave it a good clean, good results. Clit went down, urethra is still healing. I suspect minor granulation in my canal, but it comes and goes and isn&#39;t a big enough issue to treat.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still pretty tight but I&#39;m happy enough to stay on a 28mm dilator at around 6 inches depth. I started at 9 inches, but my body was very much still settling in. I could go up if I wanted to.
</p>
<p>
Esp considering the small amount of donor tissue, I&#39;m really happy with the result and the pretty minimal scarring (and location). I&#39;d recommend it as a whole. Remind me later and I&#39;ll send you pics. I&#39;m pretty tough, pretty fit, and have always healed well, and it is still taking some real time, but I&#39;m mobile and pillow free now and am looking forward to going back to the gym at 6mo post op.

Thanks for such a thorough review. Could I ask why you went for ppv, and did Dr. Theerapong have anything to say regarding your choice? Did he do a hybrid ppv, or was the entire canal made from peritoneal tissue?

My body is already going through a lot, and the way I see it colon is disturbing another organ that I can avoid. Plus, I&#39;ve heard more about stomas and things with colon, so it&#39;s just not something I wanted to try when there was an alternative.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get so much as a raised eyebrow. He just said ok,ok, when I gave the above explanation.
</p>
<p>
Hybrid, used scrotal flap and other tissue as part of it and the surrounds.

Thanks for this information.
</p>
<p>
Dr Theerapong is one of the surgeons I&#39;m considering for my SRS, when I get to that stage.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re able to give a ballpark figure for the agent costs, that would be amazing. I understand they&#39;re all different, it&#39;ll just help me work out if my current targets for enough. (I&#39;ll probably end up having to draw from my super anyway, even through the process is apparently a real pain)

600k Baht for surgery.  50k Baht for nursing 35k baht for accommodation.
</p>
<p>
Additional expenses in TH including medical supplied, hyperbaric, and food for 2 people for 4 weeks out of hospital: about AU$5,000
</p>
<p>
Once you have the surgery costs covered, the rest really isn&#39;t so bad, I think. Still a lot of money total.

Thanks for that. Looks like I have allowed for plenty of wiggle room for myself with my planned budget ( targeting $50k AUD)

Yeah you&#39;re good.
</p>
<p>
Also, T takes cash (THB) or card with a 3% surcharge, and on 30k that&#39;s a lotta money.
</p>
<p>
Convert at a favourable exchange rate and arrange with your agent to withdraw cash in country before hand if you can. I could not withdraw enough cash so my agent did it for me :)
</p>
<p>
Flying in with 600k baht in cash might throw some red flags.
</p>
<p>
I used Wise card (order the physical card, load the account with the before you go and use it to pay any charges), some banks exchange through Wise (see up bank), most bank exchange rates are hot trash and never ever use an ATM exchange, only withdraw currency.
</p>
<p>
Any time someone else does the exchange they will ABSOLUTELY add margin, check any invoices raised in AUD or USD instead of THB.

My surgery is on nov6. Interplasy quoted me 995k baht. They said I had to get a cardiologist involved during my surgery due to my heart condition. I also doing laparoscopy colon due to minimal donor material.

Best of luck! Has reality hit you yet?
</p>
<p>
And yeah a cardiologist would be expensive especially with the length of the surgery (6+ hours) and the godawful hours T keeps. Better than not making it off the table though, right?

Oddly it’s only theeraphong that won’t operate me without a cardiologist. The other surgeons didn’t require me to have a cardiologist. Than again, to be fair, theeraphong didn’t say he wanted one until he say my cardio report I did in June 2024 when I was in Bangkok.
</p>
<p>
Hasn’t quite hit me yet. I mean, I went thru a heart attack in 2016 with 3 stents.  It’s the fear of not waking up or suffering from issues due to high blood pressure. Or other complications like stopping my aspirin for way too long that my stents get clogged and causes another heart attack, etc etc.
</p>
<p>
People round me have advised me not to go ahead with my srs due to my complication. I always reply, “do you tell a cancer patient not to go thru with chemo and tumour removal? Or you tell them you’ll be there when they wake up”  if they say it’s a different matter, I always reply then if you ever had to go for surgery, I would tell you not to go for chemo but just to learn to live with it like everyone else.

He is not, in any way, a risk taker. I&#39;d suggest he required the cardiologist cause he probably thinks similar to you - the chance of complications is low, but the consequences are too high not to.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve already consulted your Dr and Theerapong about the timing of your medicines? Good to be organised. Definitely be clear with T and the staff about when you can restart Aspirin. Hospitals hate patients bringing their own drugs, in case they are proscribing the same.
</p>
<p>
Re restarting meds - I didn&#39;t clarify when I could restart hormones with T and my nurse gave me bad info and kept me off for like 4 weeks. T told me in a follow up I should have started as soon as I was out of the hospital. Always check and confirm. you are your own best advocate, especially when everyone is about saving face in TH.
</p>
<p>
And agreed - it&#39;s not optional, and goodness knows we would not voluntarily undergo this surgery unless we didn&#39;t have any other option to live a happy life. People who think otherwise must not realise how lucky they are to not need surgery.

Surgeon said 3x15m daily for a year, my nurse said 2x30m. I&#39;ve gone for the latter as the first is not very workable. I still have pretty well all my depth :)

Im booked for ppt with theerapong in March. What made you decide on ppt over colon? It seems like colon is what he&#39;s best known for but I&#39;m curious what others experiences with it are. Also did you have any input on asthetics beyond sending a picture for reference?
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your healing! 😊

Colon is disturbing another organ that I don&#39;t have to, imo. Plus it feels like I&#39;ve seen more significant complications with Colon overall but it might just be population bias (more colon surgeons than PPV).
</p>
<p>
If you can ever get on his website (maybe try Wayback machine), he has a catalogue of all prior work. I looked, but tbh I had a small amount of donor tissue, so it was kind of a best effort situation. He&#39;s big on the clitoral hoods though, and that is something I really wanted to see.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day he is a plastic surgeon, he has someone else who does the internals for PPV, and he makes the outside look good.

I checked back in with my patient care and they basically said the same. They&#39;d opt for ppv if it was them. And yeah, the number of results I&#39;ve seen without a hood is insane, it&#39;s one of the things I like most about his work, the aesthetics are great. I&#39;m looking forward to it and am terrified all at the same time, lol.

For sure, PPV only exists cause people wanted to improve on colon (I think).
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a couple of surgeons in the US and Europe, and Bank, that do similar work - but I&#39;d put a dollar on all of them being substantially more expensive overall.
</p>
<p>
I was crying in the hotel in TH pre op cause that&#39;s when it really hit for me. I think it was worth it :)

I&#39;m honestly more scared about the lead up to the surgery than the surgery itself 😅 I mean you&#39;re changing your body in a pretty significant way, it makes sense. Still though, I expect I&#39;ll be the exact same with the breakdown. Did it ease off as you were being prepped for surgery or did it keep up until they put you under?

I guess? I had like 4 short breakdowns while I was in TH, and I was fine when I went under. I&#39;d booked it like 18mo in advance so I&#39;d had plenty of time to process, it was just being scared of the risk, you know?
</p>
<p>
But when I handed over the money, I was committed, could not cancel any more without throwing away my shot.
</p>
<p>
So I guess I settled, still a bit teary before and afterwards. But it&#39;s a major life event and I&#39;m happier for it :)

I&#39;m glad it worked out 😊
</p>
<p>
I only booked 6 months in advance through amani. My deposit is down but I&#39;m still saving and doing hair removal. Did you have any trouble with lingering hair or did you get it all? That&#39;s another big worry for me. (Sorry for asking so many questions, feel free to ignore me if they aren&#39;t OK.)

I just did laser before - 10 sessions a while ago, 6 sessions on the 7 months before.
</p>
<p>
I respond extremely well to laser.
</p>
<p>
There is a little regrowth around the outside of the Majora, and definitely some on the tissue at the bottom of my vag. Internally I have had no issues that I&#39;ve noticed, but it&#39;s not like I can see inside myself.
</p>
<p>
I kinda wish I&#39;d gotten electrolysis, but honestly I&#39;m finding it ok now. By the time it settled in that I should be looking at it, it was only a few months beforehand, and I was more concerned with any potential damage from the electrolysis not being fully healed before going into surgery.

I dont mind hair on the outside just the inside. My plan was to do laser too but I decided to switch to electrolysis just to be safe. I&#39;m 5 sessions of laser and probably about 20 hours of electrolysis before surgery. Did they mention how much of the canal would be created with scrotal tissue? I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s only a small amount?

The first 2-4 inches may be scrotal tissue, I don&#39;t have an exact measure. I suppose it depends on how much there is to work with :)
</p>
<p>
Believe me when I say I get enough lubrication from what I have. I have to wear liners any time I wear clothes, and I&#39;ve given up on keeping the sheets clean.

Hi! I hope you heal really well x  Could you please share details about hyperbaric chamber treatment? Where did you get it from and how much it’d cost?

Hey! I had it at something like goowonmom or something like that and it cost me about au$1000 for 10 sessions. It&#39;s kinda faded into memory now but it was definitely worth it.
</p>
<p>
Lying down in the pressure chamber was excellent.

It’s used to increase oxygen saturation in cells and thus promote healing.

Yeah what the other commenters said, it increases oxygen in the blood which helps healing.
</p>
<p>
For me it applied enough atmospheric pressure that it kinda pushed back the sensation of the swelling as well. It went well for me.
