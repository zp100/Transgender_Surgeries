I just had type 3 forehead with Bensimon yesterday. He is a wonderfully passionate doctor and was very supportive and proud of his work. He held my hand as I went under.  Yes there is pain. Bone pain. And on your head where all the nerves are sensitive.  But stay super super on top of the pain killers and it’s a little easier. Very dizzy. Sleep about an hour or two at a time. Some nausea and confusion for the first day. I didn’t realize with just forehead I wouldn’t be able to eat solid food right away. So prep soft soft meals.  But ya. It hurts. Bone pain hits a bit different.

This is actually super reassuring. I don&#39;t see Bensimon talked about very much and I&#39;m scheduled with him in a few months.

FFS was more painful and intense, but recovered faster.
</p>
<p>
Especially not having a fully functional nose and mouth, brutal few days.  But I flew home week 2.5, at work week 5, and dating week 6.
</p>
<p>
SRS I couldn&#39;t do anything until week 9

I am not having anything done to my nose, so hopefully, I won&#39;t have to deal with any significant swelling in that area. What I am most afraid of is having both my eyes shut due to swelling, making it difficult to see. That sounds terrifying.
</p>
<p>
How painful would you say the surgery was? What procedure hurt the most?

Nothing to the nose? Usually they have to do half of it to match the new brow.  Are you sure they&#39;re not doing any upper bridge work?  Did they recommend it?
</p>
<p>
Mine swelled up 80% for about three days.  I could still watch tv and do what I could if they didn&#39;t swell at all.
</p>
<p>
The whole face.  Not one area specifically, just the pain, discomfort, and headache from swelling.

You are right, they will do the upper part of my nose for a smooth transition to the forehead. Is that going to cause significant swelling in the nose area to the point where you can&#39;t breathe through your nose?
</p>
<p>
How was that experience? Is it something you get used to relatively fast, or was it a scary experience?

I can&#39;t answer that first part.  I suppose if they still pack the nostrils, which they might, that you would lose breathing from there.
</p>
<p>
I just tried not to do anything.  I didn&#39;t get used to it fully, but could accept it.
</p>
<p>
Having mucus drip down my throat and possibly choke me without any way of clearing it on my own was scary.  I was actually screaming in terror bc I at times was drowning in my own fluids and was left unattended by the hospital staff.  Worse now with covid preventing someone at your side who could help just collect the spit.
</p>
<p>
Once that was done, I didn&#39;t panic.  It was just a week long hangover and swelling

What made it hard to clear the mucus? I have ffs scheduled for next September and I’m just curious what causes this. It sounds terrifying.

You can&#39;t use your nose to clear the upper tract.  So it drips constantly.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of it.  Along with blood.  Swallowing it is not only difficult, but really really gross.  Ideally you want to just spit it out, but I was left without anything to spit into or within reach.  And since you can&#39;t sit up all the way, you&#39;ll have lots of drool on your face that needs wiping.
</p>
<p>
Nurses will ignore patients who aren&#39;t actually dying.  Needing help spitting isn&#39;t on their list of priorities.
</p>
<p>
After waking up I would just make sure you have something to spit in within reach.  Along with plenty of gauze.
</p>
<p>
I had a 9 hour operation.  I hope it goes smoother for other patients or for those in a better facility.

I’m going to see Keojampa and it’s projected to be a 10 hour surgery. I’ll be sure to ask for these things, thank you for sharing, and someone mentioned I should ask for something to pee into too.

I&#39;m almost done with week 3 of recovery. I started working again next week, but I work from home teaching voice feminization, so I&#39;m ok to do that.
</p>
<p>
As for surgical recovery, the first 2 nights were miserable. They wanted me in the hospital those two nights and while the bed was comfortable, the pain was constant. It wasn&#39;t super intense, it was just always there. Morphine helped a lot, but didn&#39;t last super long and the other pain meds took awhile to get started. The worst part was the nose packing. Having to breathe through my mouth for those 2 days was crappy. My mouth and lips were constantly dry. When those nose tampons came out, it was such a relief.
</p>
<p>
Having to sleep on my back sucked too. You&#39;ll probably have to wear a nose splint on your face for a couple weeks. I had staples in my head for 2 weeks. Stitches on the underside of my nose for a week. Most of it was just discomfort, some pain, just not a lot of really sharp sudden pain. It was constant dull pain that just wears you down. Take naps and stay hydrated.

I am not having a rhinoplasty so not going to need a nose splint and hopefully won&#39;t need any nose stuffing.  As for laying on the back, I am used to it by now. After srs, you essentially have two weeks where you lay on your back 24/7 without the ability to get up with the exception of some very short trips to the bathroom and stuff.
