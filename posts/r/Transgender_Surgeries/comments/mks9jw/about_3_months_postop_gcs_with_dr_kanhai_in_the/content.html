It looks amazing! I can&#39;t wait for my own GCS.
</p>
<p>
Did you have it done in the VUMC?

No, I didn&#39;t do VUMC. I&#39;d had to wait 5 to 7 years there üòÖ I went with Dr Kanhai at Mk Velsen. Waiting list would&#39;ve been so long since I did HRT and stuff over at Stepwork

Yeah, waiting times are a bitch everywhere üòû I still have to wait until May until I get my surgery referrals. Can you just go to that clinic and make an appointment, and is it then covered by insurance?

To answer your question, yes! If you are currently at VUMC or UMCG you&#39;ll need to jump through some hoops, but other places should just refer you.
</p>
<p>
If you are at VUMC or UMCG, you&#39;ll need to take these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Get green light from your psych
</li>
<li>
Get a referral to
<a href="https://www.mkvelsen.nl/verwijzers/">Mk Velsen</a>
from your GP/PCP
</li>
<li>
Your GP/PCP should be able to refer you digitally via ZorgDomein, if not, fill in
<a href="https://www.mkvelsen.nl/afsprakenformulier/">the contact form</a>
and sent the referral with it.
</li>
<li>
After a week of two you should&#39;ve been called by Mk Velsen to make an appointment. If not, call them and make an appointment
</li>
</ol>
<p>
From there on out, you&#39;ll get your first consult and a referral to do hair removal in the genital area. This&#39;ll probably take somewhere between 4 and 12 months. Once that&#39;s done, call/mail Mk Velsen to check if everything is fine and get a surgery date.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, the biggest part of the waiting list at VUMC for me would&#39;ve been that they wanted to re-do the diagnosis. So 2 years before intake, then 6 months for diagnosis. Followed by a more extensive hair removal pattern than Mk Velsen requires and another 2+ years on the waiting list for GCS...

Thanks for all the information! I already have the green light, and have been doing genital hair removal (have to do electro instead of laser, ugh) for a few months now so I could be really close. I think I&#39;ll be calling my GP this week then and see what happens.

Best of luck! And I hope electrolysis down there is doable for you &lt;3 I have to do my whole face that way, and it&#39;s not great. Be sure to ask Kanhai to take a look if you&#39;ve already done a ton of hair removal. He&#39;s not that picky on the results, I was done with just 3 sessions of laser.

Same for me with my face. I&#39;m probably looking at another year of that as well :P Thank God I don&#39;t have to pay for it at least. And yeah I will. I&#39;ve only done 3 sessions of electro down there so I think I&#39;ll need a bit more, but we&#39;ll see.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for all the info ^.^

Ooh, amazing! I&#39;ll be having my surgery done at Dr. Kanhai&#39;s at the end of this year and I am mega ultra hyped
</p>
<p>
Did you opt to get breast implants at the same time? He&#39;s offered me that option but I&#39;m unsure about it yet.

He did ask me that same question, but I decided against it as I was almost exactly 1 year in and was still growing. I
<em>
might
</em>
go back to do those later, but still unsure. I want to be at least 3 years on HRT before deciding anything like that. I still have hope I&#39;ll grow a bit larger. Maybe...
</p>
<p>
I did see some amazing results from a friend of mine who had BA with him earlier this week though, and it does look amazing. Looks like he makes incisions on the lower outside of the breasts to put in the implants.

There is feeling, that&#39;s for sure. I just haven&#39;t been able to orgasm yet, but that&#39;s probably because I have no idea how to do it
