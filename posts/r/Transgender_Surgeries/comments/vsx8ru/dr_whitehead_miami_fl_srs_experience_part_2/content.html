Those doctors sound like literal demons
</p>
<p>
And the reason they said your result was &#34;perfect&#34; is simply to gaslight you, they dont really care they just wanted your insurance money

Yep that is exactly how these psychopaths operate. Don&#39;t give a shit other than about stupid shit. Wtf are they doing surgery for clout. In Texas I can&#39;t get insurance to cover vaginoplasty. 🥳 Lucky me.

…holy fuck. I really hope you’re doing okay, your experience sounds awful.
</p>
<p>
After reading both of your posts, I absolutely think this warrants a medical malpractice lawsuit. I don’t mean that lightly. The night nurse falling asleep on you, the pain med issues, the guilt-tripping and lying is fucking ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Dr. Whitehead has a bit of a reputation for this. Please report this in some manner so he has a formal paper trail of issues. Someone else on this sub has similar issues from the same surgeon (including asymmetry) and posted today about it.

That&#39;s really unacceptable. If they want holidays they shouldn&#39;t be performing surgery.

i am a long term vegetarian/close to vegan and have had many surgeries some trans related and others spinal.   Not once has a doctor said anything about my diet.   I’ve never had any complications either.   Weird.

I was told by my top surgeon that increasing your protein intake is helpful after surgery because your body uses protein in wound healing, but it should be protein your body is used to digesting—if you’re vegetarian/vegan, this is the wrong time to start eating meat. I can’t understand why any medical professional would advise a patient to radically change their diet while their body is already going through surgery recovery, that’s super irresponsible. And that’s not even touching on all the other incredibly neglectful things happening here.

It honestly didn’t seem like a problem before I got there lmao. It actually made my recovery worse by breaking my diet. I was so constipated maybe a month or so after surgery despite taking Miralax and dulcolax. I had some constipation from the opiates but nothing like this. I had to legit use an enema because it was so painful (sorry if tmi). I also had the worst heartburn of my life and I never have had heartburn before. When I switched back, all of that went away. I’m even taking an iron supplement and I have no digestive problems.

Yeah, I can’t imagine your system adjusted well to animal protein o/d after not having any.   I could see them asking you to supplement protein with a vegan protein powder.  But this is not 1910- it’s easy to live healthfully as a vegan, except of course, in a Hospital,lol.

And that’s the other thing, I wasn’t in a hospital. It’s like a medical center where you stay overnight. I could have been eating vegan the whole time lmao. At least I know now

Plus docs aren’t nutritionists either, nor should they pretend to be. They don’t get nearly enough education in that area to be giving that kind of advice

gosh-  this is wild. I&#39;m so, so sorry you had to go through this. I can&#39;t believe they would care that little about such life changing and traumatizing stuff. it sure worries me a lot, but really I am glad these doctors are behind you now

Idk they’re human too but it would have helped to see more humanity from them during the process. Who knows, maybe they will change for the better and in another 5 years they could be really fabulous about their aftercare. But I think it’s important to discuss stuff like this because otherwise, our care as trans people won’t be the best that it could be. The whole time it felt like I was bothering them by being there. It wasn’t until after that I realized that none of that was my fault. I’m thankful I made it out without a fistula or any other major complications, I just wish it could have been a better experience, had more depth and had better aesthetics. But hey there’s always revision surgery options too I guess.

Wow that is insane. To me it is wild when people say they were discharged the next day. For all the things that were messed up about my surgery at least they let me take my time healing. I was on total bed rest for most of a week with a catheter in, and barely walking once the catheter was removed. I didn&#39;t go home for over a week and they wouldn&#39;t let me be discharged until I had a bowel movement to make sure everything was OK in that respect. Even after I got discharged it was hard to pee though, you have a ton of inflammation around your urethra and sitting doesn&#39;t help that. I feel like there are lots of offices throwing together services for trans surgeries but without the necessary support. And there are so many misconceptions about trans people, their care and surgeries, even in the medical field. But really how they treated you was fucked up. I will say that time and healing fixed more things than I expected it to so hopefully that&#39;s true for your results.

I hope so too and I’m sorry your experience sounds like a difficult journey too. They’re like the Fisher Price of the trans surgery world. It felt like I was an object on their factory line and they just saw me like a faulty product. It would have been really cool to be treated like a human, not like flesh on a table.

That&#39;s horrible. I was so grateful that for the most part the hospital staff was very kind when I had my surgery, even when events weren&#39;t ideal. But also I feel like that should be the bare minimum. Sorry that wasn&#39;t the case for you

My goodness I am so very sorry to hear how inhumanly you were treated by those doctors. That is just unacceptable. The way they tried to gaslight you into thinking that this was all your fault and not a sign off issues from surgery that needed tending to is so disgusting. I’m keeping you in my thoughts &amp; prayers as you continue to heal. And I hope you can get a reversion ASAP.
