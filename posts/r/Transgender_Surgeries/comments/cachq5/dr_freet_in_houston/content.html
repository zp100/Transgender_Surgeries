I had a consult with him for SRS and breast augmentation and was impressed with how he carried himself and his professionalism.  I do not plan on having surgery with him because since he works for the college he isn’t allow to show pictures of his work, or so he says. That is a huge no go for me.

We he does actually work for a college and I don’t know how that works so I can only take his word on it. Don’t regret the consult but won’t be having my surgery with him. At least not GRS.

I haven&#39;t heard of him. I am a medical student and am well acquainted with UT Health (the institution he works for) but nothing I have seen on his CV or on his institutional profile page indicates any extensive training in transgender surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;s a competent surgeon in his own right, but I&#39;m not sure if I would go to him for SRS. Maybe I would go just for a consultation, but be prepared with your questions about his training in trans surgery, # of bottom surgery procedures he&#39;s performed, reported outcomes, photos,  etc. Don&#39;t let anybody pressure you one way or another! Best of luck.
