My gender affirmation surgery took place in March 2020, in Germany. Almost 6 months post-op. Still little bit redness, but it&#39;s fading. Wonderful 100% sensation inside and outside. Natural lubrication from urethral lining. Feels exactly like cis vagina. Had numerous climaxes.

Who did your surgery? Was it Schaff by any chance? I&#39;m torn between him and Bank. If so, will you come back for a revision or are you happy enough as is? I&#39;ve heared he always does his magic in 2 stages but I wonder how crucial the second one actually is. It&#39;s either incredibly hard to find pictures of his results or I&#39;m too stupid to look for them. Or the girls plain just don&#39;t want to show.

Indeed, this masterpiece is an artwork of famous Dr J√ºrgen Schaff. I think he was very surprised that I actually don&#39;t really need revision, but yes I want revision as he has promised me additional procedures: anatomic breasts and facial feminisation. I don&#39;t know yet details. My revision in 4 weeks and Covid-19 makes it tricky, but not impossible. I&#39;m very, very excited. As is now my vulva is super pretty (as you can say from picture) and my vagina is just fantastic üòç

Would you by any chance be willing to take a plain color picture in the same angle but in a natural state (so no hands or tools involved). I&#39;m particularly interested in how the labia &#34;fall&#34; when nothing is pushing or pulling them in a particular direction.
</p>
<p>
Also, I&#39;ve read that Schaff does not require you to get hair removed frkm you nether region beforehand. Did you end up with any inconveniences in that regard?
</p>
<p>
Also also, how much of the glans does he use when forming the clitoris? I&#39;m trying to discern how big it might be when it&#39;s my turn.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and sorry if I&#39;m too probing on intimate things. Feel free to tell me off if you feel uncomfortable answering.

I had laser done for 4 years, so I don&#39;t know anything about this besides the fact that I think you are right and Dr Schaff does not require you to remove your pubic hair. Although I think it&#39;s best to do laser. My laser didn&#39;t remove all hair. I don&#39;t think there is any hair growing inside vaginall, but there&#39;s few hairs growing on my labia majora and when I dilate I catch sometimes a hair and pull it casing some discomfort. I haven&#39;t yet shaved there, because I&#39;m scared of damaging it.
</p>
<p>
Trust me, this method leaves you with so much sensation that you won&#39;t feel the difference before and after. Well... I actually did. I prefer the sensation I have now, and I am guessing it is because nerves that used to be far apart now are close together. Just think about those 20 000 nerves on glans-prepuce joint that are preserved! Also now I can have fun mattress grinding. One more thing. I bought me self this device for perineum muscles training. It&#39;s called Perefit. I&#39;m currently on Level 3 of Intimate Wellbeing. Yes, I have all spongy muscles there! Yes, I can squeeze dicks, and guys obviously love that üòÅ

Cosmetic surgery. We&#39;ll make my labia majora prettier, and and we&#39;ll cut my fourchette down 2cm to lower the entrance to the vagina. Fourchette is very elastic as is, and you can pull it down with the finger, but maybe if it&#39;s lowered it will be less hassle when trying to insert penis. Although from my point of view as is it gives me pleasure and I like when penis slides on it. Also my labia majora - the way they are they give me pleasure, so I don&#39;t know how I feel about removing any even smallest bits. Essentially I&#39;m saying that I have sensation in every millimeter of my vulva and vagina and I would keep them as they are, but... I dunno. Some part of me is curious to make it prettier...

I&#39;m confused about the urethral lining part. The major reason why I don&#39;t want penile inversion technique, is because of the lack of natural lubrication. Can you elaborate on this technique? I was thinking about peritoneal vaginoplasty to have natural lubrication, but I&#39;m curious.

The technique is quite interesting. Urethra is opened and forms upper vaginal wall. The deep vagina is made of specially prepared (don&#39;t ask - I have no answer) scrotum tissue. Deep vagina starts somewhere just behind pubic bone, and before it is penile tissue &#34;split as banana&#34; (I stole this phrase from interview with Danica Roem). I front the split is filled with glans and prepuce tissue forming hood, clitoris, Hart&#39;s line, upper vestibule, inner part of labia minora (outer part together with labia majora is made of penile skin). Below clitoris I&#39;ve got Meatus made of Y-shape split urethra. The nerves and blood supply is all behind these tissues. The spongy muscles are preserved, bulbospongiosus muscles are preserved (that&#39;s why I can enjoy fun with Perefit perineal muscle trainer). Important aspect is that dorsal nerves are not damaged (they are extremely important in achieving orgasm).
</p>
<p>
As the result of this technique vagina is deep and wide from very beginning. Recently I became lazy with dilations, and doesn&#39;t seem like my vagina would shrink. The urethral tissue deep inside vagina is erogeninc. Mucus tissue seems to be growing everywhere inside vagina and vestibule and provides plenty of lubrication. I need to drink a plenty of water to sustain good lubrication. The spatial sensation is correct, i.e. left feel left, right - right, and depth feels deep - all sensation is correctly located in space.

I had penile inversion and I naturally lubricate. Not a crazy amount but plenty. It&#39;s generally always a little wet down there, and girlfriend can really get it going. I don&#39;t know if it comes from urethral tissue or prostate or what. There isn&#39;t much research into this. Some women who get inversion don&#39;t lubricate, some lubricate more than me. It&#39;s a big question mark in the medical community. Sorry I can&#39;t be more helpful.

The results might be better than others but it still doesn&#39;t really look the same since what I&#39;m guessing are supposed to be the inner labia, the one left, looks really thick but the one right is half inside? It doesn&#39;t look as symmetrical. The perineum looks really long as well. Does it stretch as much as a vagina or do you need to keep dilating? It&#39;s nice you have good sensation.

Note that thid is the result of the first surgery, and revision is there to improve on cosmetic aspects. You have noticed correctly that labia minora don&#39;t appear in full symmetry. However they are both made same way, and technically they are almost same size. Nevertheless the whole inner vulva is bit twisted, and thus they appear asymmetrical. From sensation perspective they are the same. We were discussing this issue with the surgeon, and during revision he will see if it is safe to adjust it. Personally I prefer good sensation over ridiculously symmetrical outcome.
</p>
<p>
You have also noticed that my fourchette is very high. I like it that way as more tissue gives me more pleasure during sexual intercourse and additionally it protects my vagina from dirt getting inside. We have discussed this with surgeon and during revision he will adjust it.
</p>
<p>
Personally I love my vulva the way it is. It&#39;s healing very fast, I have no problems with it, and I really enjoy it.
</p>
<p>
Advice from my side would be to think well what actually matters to you most. I would never advise going  with the first available choice. Do your research. I only provided you with one picture and some information. You make your choice for you, and not for anyone else. Remember about that.

üåπI just wanted to add more infoüåπ
</p>
<p>
üåû Appearance üåû It looks like cis vulva. I say that, because I am fully aware that there is no such thing as standard of how female vulva should look like. On the contrary, and there was a project to prove that, every vulva is different. Men I had pleasure with have admired the looks of my vulva a lot, and that is all I need. I don&#39;t need to conform to any standards.
</p>
<p>
üåû Lubrication üåû Inside my vagina there lives natural female bacterial flora. This has been confirmed by the swab test, which I had in May this year. What happens is the urethral lining promotes growth of mucus tissue inside vagina, and mucus is produced. The bacteria eat that and produce lots of fluid, and I end up with an &#34;ocean&#34; inside.
</p>
<p>
üåû Muscles üåû They are there, can be trained (e. g. I use Perefit biofeedback games), and then you can enjoy your sex life more.
</p>
<p>
üåû Orgasm üåû The orgasm is achieved by stimulation a of all areas and not only one single point. The stimulation of the urethral lining inside vagina, the stimulation of the &#34;Hymen&#34; area, the stimulation of the fourchette, stimulation of the Hart&#39;s line, labia majora, and of course clitoris and hood. When all these areas are stimulated proper orgasm can occur. When that happens some fluid is ejaculated from Meatus and whole vestibule get covered in it.

You will need bulbospongiosus muscles. Surgeons usually remove those muscles, not sure if Dr Schaff is the only surgeon who does not do that. Spongious muscles are normally in the way to your vagina and if you can&#39;t relax them then you won&#39;t be able to dilate. But that&#39;s all the fun üòâ

Ooo I&#39;ll definitely have to ask Dr.Ting at my 9 month checkup appointment on the 17th!
</p>
<p>
I can control the muscles around my vaginal wall pretty well... but I think I could learn to relax them better to make dilation easier. Hoping this toy helps!

Probably yes. You can insert a finger and contract muscles. You should feel the muscles contracting.

Depth was 11-13cm, but over last month it stretched and today I was seeing 14cm. That&#39;s a lot. I had a guy with really big penis and we had very uncomplicated sex. No need for any additional lubrication. Well, maybe a spit on hand and moisture entrance a bit, but that&#39;s it. My very first intercourse (4 weeks ago, 4 months post-op) was very careful at the beginning, but then he just went fast and f***d me hard, and I could feel him inside and that was such an amazing feeling. We checked and there was no damage, not a smallest drop of blood. My vagina withstood all this no problem. My next intercourses were in cowgirl position, and I must say I went really full on with the fun. I really enjoyed it. The guys were saying that my vulva is really prety, prettier than most cis girls have, and one guy who dated trans girls said he has never seen such a wonderful trans vagina. Just saying üòâ

So glad to hear your happiness about your experiences!! And nice to hear such detailed accounts from folks who have gone to European surgeons. Compared to mine (check my post history) yours has a much more floral look! If I were to be picky I think I prefer that a little more than mine, but don&#39;t worry, I do love how mine turned out! Anyway, Congratulations to you!! Best of luck in the revision and further healing stages. ‚ù§Ô∏è

There&#39;s fantastic description of combined method in comparison to penile inversion. They also compare German variations vs Dr Suporn method.

Wow I&#39;ve seen a lot of SRS pictures and I think this is the best I&#39;ve ever seen. Looks so natural and the lubrication really shows. You said it was from urethral lining? How does that work, I&#39;ve never heard of it.

OK.... That looks that good I&#39;m thinking if I could have that then my non op opinion would deffo be changed.

Can I ask what it cost? As that is stunning and is far better than what I expect the NHS to produce.

The cost was around ‚Ç¨40k (including both surgeries and breast augumentation). Perhaps you can get refund from health insurance.

All I can tell you is that it feels great. I love it.

This seems Odd, isn&#39;t Schaff the only one doing GRS in Germany for people on public insurance? Why would you pay out of pocket (or rather, why would that even be possible)?

I only know of Dr J√ºrgen Schaff who performs his method. Also worth noting his method is special combined method, which uses urethra tissue in most optimal way, and all the junctions inner vulva are thought through. No unnecessary incisions, no nerves damaged, all blood supply preserved. Additionally he put a lot of attention to create beautiful interlabial sulci. My sensation is everywhere. I would say there must be some deep structures of my vulva, because when I push my lovely vibrator against vestibule, this is how I get best orgasms.

In my personal opinion costs are very reasonable, and if they weren&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be paying out of my pocket. I could have had them covered by my Irish health insurance, but I didn&#39;t follow their procedures (I made a claim after the operation, and that insurance company requires to do it before) and they refused my claim. I was hoping to try again with my revision surgery.

I&#39;m Polish and living in Ireland. I chosen Dr Schaff, because in my personal opinion his method is the best, and (that&#39;s my personal view) he&#39;s the best surgeon on the planet. Again, it&#39;s my very personal (perhaps opinionated) views. Nevertheless, at the end I&#39;m very, very happy with the result üòâ

üåπüåπüåπ Dear friends üåπüåπüåπ I have posted this photograph for you. I am aware (from my own experience) that it is very hard to find post-op photographs. Some surgeons will publish on their websites and some won&#39;t. In my understanding German law prohibits that, so you wont be able to see anywhere results of Dr Schaff procedure unless someone like me voluntarily share the picture.
</p>
<p>
About me and my credibility. I would like to share link to an article that covers my surgery published on GenderGP website.

I hope this information helps you stay assured that all the information I provided is true, although be also aware that it is my personal point of view and yours may be different. I share with you my experience and not absolute knowledge, and if that is helping you, then I&#39;m glad, and it&#39;s ok if not.

It‚Äôs a great post and I‚Äôm going to add it to the wiki so others can find it more easily in the future.

If you don‚Äôt mind a few more photos would be helpful, in particular no finders so it‚Äôs in the natural state and spread open more to see the internal structure.
