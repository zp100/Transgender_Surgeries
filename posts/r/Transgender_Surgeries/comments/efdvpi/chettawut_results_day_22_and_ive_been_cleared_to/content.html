Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Chettawut over Dr. Suporn? Do you recommend Dr. Chettawut? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Chettawut&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

My recovery has been better than textbook perfect. Chett has a shorter wait list that isn&#39;t lottery based (3-6 months), a little cheaper, and I don&#39;t think supporn is doing surgeries any more (may be wrong, but I think it&#39;s banks now). I had a very good experience and would recommend him, but gcs surgeons are a very personal choice that differs from person to person. I&#39;m very pleased with both cosmetics and sensation, but it hasn&#39;t even been 30 days yet, I&#39;ll prob do a 6 month post. The stay was great, I stayed in dusit princess hotel, the staff here are amazing. Chett&#39;s aftercare care is amazing, a nurse sleeps in your room the first few nights and when you&#39;re sent back to the hotel nurses visit every day except Sunday to check on you and your recovery. I got the cosmetic option so I have no dilation routine.

Great result!
</p>
<p>
How far do you have to travel? If it is  long distance, any provisions for making yourself comfortable on a long journey? What are the risks of not being able to dilate over a long trip?

Thanks! I have to fly back to the us east coast .. around 24 hours with layovers. Given how uncomfortable sitting is still, even with a donut, I decided to purchase a layflat seat with Korean air, it wasn&#39;t cheap but worth the credit card debt for a few months. My surgery was a shallow depth/ cosmetic procedure, so I have no dilation routine.

What does Chet suggest you&#39;ll end up with for depth from this style of procedure?

From what I&#39;ve heard from other girls who have a long flight the lack of dilation is a minor temporary setback.

This looks amazing. Thank you for sharing. I&#39;m possibly going to do no depth in a few months but worried about potential regret..and pleasure...  can I ask your thoughts on that?  I am into my wife only so not worried about penetration, but atill unsure if its enough to enjoy yourself when the time comes?

The depth decision is a very personal one. I dont have any regrets so far, but it&#39;s only been 5 months and I still worry off and on that I may suddenly regret it (I&#39;m asexual too if that helps paint the picture). In terms of masturbating, I can get off every attempt and was able to since the end of month 3 after surgery.

Oh good this is good news to hear. Yeah I&#39;m leaning more and more towards this for many reasons now and  I hate regrets so trying to avoid it if possible.  I really regret not coming to terms with being trans 20 years ago....  but I&#39;m sure we all know that feeling.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your reply too, I really hesitated asking because of the type of question it is but it really means a lot.

😁  I may have more. But my God am I ready!  So far I&#39;ve got full support from work and family and friends, have my letters in, and dr said we can schedule as soon as pandemic allows ( just got an email Monday saying they are starting elective surgeries back up! But I fear it&#39;s too soon as I don&#39;t think pandemic is even close to being a thing of the past...)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty set on the no depth option at this point as well.  I can&#39;t see why I would regret it and I can&#39;t see why I&#39;d need the full as well.
