My surgeons were Suominen Sinikka and V채nsk채 Jenni-Katri.
</p>
<p>
There is still some swelling that does not go down around my peehole, needs a small surgery to fix it.
<br>
Other than that I&#39;m happy. There is still plenty of healing and settling down to happen, it&#39;s only been 7 months.
</p>
<p>
Depth is about 13 cm / 5 inches comfortably. Width of my dilator is 3.8 cm / 1.5 inches, but bigger penis has managed to fit in.

Yes! Both clitoris and vagina.  Feeling has not fully healed yet, some spots are numbish.
</p>
<p>
Clit is very sensitive however swelling in the nearby area gets in the way.
</p>
<p>
Tail of the clitoris is also by the wall of the vagina giving erogenous stimulation. Sex feels good as long as I&#39;m arroused.
</p>
<p>
Still healing tho.  Some numbness and lacks in sensation might take a while longer to recover.

thanks posting. i think this is the first time i have ever seen posted anything from Finland.
</p>
<p>
i understand that one or both of the doctors left Finland for Sweden... so i wonder how it might be with the remaining doctors.  (meaning this would have given me some hope had my surgery happened last spring.  not sure what to expect now).

Hi I am also here in Finland. I just finished my last nurse appointment this week after official diagnosis. Nurse said I will be queued for the surgery afterwards. How many months did you wait between your last assessment and the actual surgery? Thanks! :)

i hadn&#39;t seen photos from Finland, and kinda stopped looking at some point as surgery seemed a distant dream.  was surprised to get call that i&#39;m in about two months, so trying to plan things.
</p>
<p>
probably have dozens of questions, but the three that are most on my mind, is if i need to get my own dilators, with recommendations of who ships to Finland.
</p>
<p>
any other things i should do to prepare at the two month point?
</p>
<p>
also, looking at the pictures, it almost seems like at two months a person could chance doing physical therapy in the pool (nothing strenuous... just slow survival strokes and the kind of movement exercises that the over 50 groups do in the pools.  But what is a sensible timeline for things like that?

Ask all the questions as You wish.
</p>
<p>
They give You a protoscope to use as a dilator. The one I got from them had bigger part and smaller part that could be used as dilator.  But yes it is preferable to get Your own dilator set.  Remember also to get both skin oil such as ceradil or ceraderm and lubricant (i think it was waterbased lubricant You&#39;re supposed to use).  They should give You a list of things You&#39;re supposed to get Yourself.
</p>
<p>
Can deside what set of dilators You want. For example, here is the set that I got for myself.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://kauppa.pedihealth.fi/raskaus-synnytys-ja-naistentaudit/stimulaattorit-ja-harjoitusvalineet/amielle-comfort-dilataattori-p-2229.html" rel="nofollow">https://kauppa.pedihealth.fi/raskaus-synnytys-ja-naistentaudit/stimulaattorit-ja-harjoitusvalineet/amielle-comfort-dilataattori-p-2229.html
</a>
</p>
<p>
The weight limit for surgery is BMI 30. Make sure You&#39;re under it and not over. Be healthy. Maybe go on walks, good health helps with recovery.
</p>
<p>
There is a list of items You should have for after surgery. Get them before. If You don&#39;t have the list, I can see if I can find it.
</p>
<p>
Something You might want and home are protein shakes, they help healing. Also bring energybank (battery) and chargers.
</p>
<p>
You may not be able to get Your phone to charge at the wall when stuck in bed. Easier if You can have energybank charge while You use Your phone and charge Your phone with energybank.
</p>
<p>
Puistosairaala inbed patient ward had big smart TVs that You can stream feed from phone. I binge watched Shameless USA from start to finnish. Maybe bring other phone if You have since it would not let me just transfer netflix feed, but had to share screen. Could not use my phone and watch show at the same time -.-*... 1st world problems...
</p>
<p>
You should be ready for something I did not expect. On the day of the surgery I got lot of anxiety. It was not rational as I would rather die than live without the surgery. But I got so afraid that it was hard to sit still in the waiting room. Anxiety was pushing ne toward runing. I&#39;ve been to surgery before, still I got very afraid. That may happen. If that happens to You, don&#39;t run. If You need bring a friend or call a friend. Call me if You don&#39;t reach anyone. But don&#39;t run just because of the surgery anxiety.
</p>
<p>
I forgot the recovery timeline. They will give You estimated timeline as part of information regarding the surgery.  After 6 weeks I was back at work. I don&#39;t remember did I go for walks even before that. But at two months I think yes You propably can do that what You said. Possibly even after one month, but I can&#39;t promise that. They will see and tell You as You visit them for post surgery control appointments.

thanks feedbacks.
</p>
<p>
i was supposed to have surgery in February (told me in July 23 and Nov 23 they&#39;d call me then...) then they never called or answered messages.  so i went through some of the kinda panic that comes from thinking you&#39;re just 4-8 weeks away from surgery.  and it is weird, i first envisioned the &#34;surgery chair&#34; when i was 5.  but its easy to find reasons to be afraid...
</p>
<p>
people have posted some bad experiences that they had... and those stick in mind, so i have my own and everyone else&#39;s fear.  (big one right now is that while i&#39;m under, they&#39;ll decide there&#39;s not enough stuff to work with - i have been on hrt for 5 years, and even then was a &#34;grower&#34; so always looked like there was nothing, despite it &#34;inflating&#34; to normal size... well, pre-hrt... its not inflated in 5 years now).  Anyway, so I have this nightmare that i wake and they tell me they had to switch to zero depth.
</p>
<p>
I did almost by the charging thing... think i did once, but knew i&#39;d lose it.  Once I settle into my new city (just moved to Pori), then I&#39;ll get a kit.
</p>
<p>
I do have a Epi-no birth preparation and pelvic floor trainer (meant for prior to giving birth.)  someone once recommended it for post-surgery... no idea if its sensible to use (basically is a narrow long air balloon that can be slowly inflated.).  but ofc i&#39;ll look at the dilators and figure what might be best.
</p>
<p>
i stock the protein shakes for when i&#39;m sick... didn&#39;t think about using them for after surgery.
</p>
<p>
i have one friend in Helsinki... i&#39;ll try to see if she can block off my surgery date (she works long hours at her salon, so would feel kinda guilty pulling her away during the day).  i think i can manage not to run... when i got married in 94, i *very much* wanted to run and somehow didn&#39;t.  (if i didn&#39;t love my children so much, i&#39;d say that i *should* have run :P ).  but idk if i can predict how i&#39;ll feel. and whether i&#39;d need support or not.  really hard to imagine.
</p>
<p>
if i&#39;m zoning out on Netflix, i probably won&#39;t care so much about using my phone for anything else. anyway, with just one sim card, idk how i&#39;d use my old phone to funnel my netflix to the TV anyway.
</p>
<p>
I should be well under the BMI.  I did gain some when i hurt my back (which tbh isn&#39;t 100% better yet), but after my move is over, hope to get things moving.  but on my consult day, i&#39;m sure to be under, but not by as much as normal (normally i&#39;m around 22%)
</p>
<p>
recovery timeline sounds good, although i have read a lot of variation (although part of that is based on different surgery techniques)
</p>
<p>
okay, back to packing... thanks so much for responding.

Haha. Mine was &#34;grower&#34; too. Inflated might reach at most average size. But on the other end it would be shorter and thinner than my thumb. Thankfully that, less dysforic and easier to tuck being so small.
</p>
<p>
Even so, the foreskin was used to make clitorical hood. Depth was limited by prostate. They didn&#39;t remove the prostate since erogenous nerves go through it. Had they removed prostate I could have had more depth, but lost erogenous sensation.
</p>
<p>
I have about 12-13 cm of depth. My bigest dilator is 3.5 cm wide, but a little wider penis has managed to fit in. Some penises that I&#39;ve tried to have sex with have been too thick to fit in. Some manage to reach the bottom, but that doesn&#39;t prevent sex.
</p>
<p>
So even if Your penis is small. The skin does strech to it.

okay, thanks.  the only male parnter that i ever had was... kinda big... which scared me cos there doesn&#39;t seem to be so much material for the doctors to work with.
</p>
<p>
(if i could afford to go abroad, and then do the non-penile inversion using the scrotal tissues for the canal), then i could get good depth as I stretch that when i apply the gel every day.
</p>
<p>
i had thought that my prostate had shrunk, cos of being on hormones for 5 years and that it doesn&#39;t do anything... but at last ultrasound the doctor said out loud &#34;i see prostate at normal size&#34;... it was like, the only thing he said to me during his looking (which was for the purpose of dealing with digestive issues which he...said nothing about.  almost as if he mentioned to prostate just to be hurtful? idk).
</p>
<p>
but i have some more hope now... thanks responding :)

This is Suomikin phone reddit account.  I just had the pre surgery meeting.  Basically they asked if I had any questions, I had no idea what to ask and the meeting was over after a quick physical exam to see if skin graft was needed (might be).
</p>
<p>
So the only list I have is from reading Reddit and compiling ideas...
</p>
<p>
I did order some dilators, but have to figure the best lube for the silicone dilators.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how they do food.  Do I bring own things for between meals or for when I can&#39;t eat solid (i.e. bring my own Nutridrink)?  Are the beds and pillows okay or do o bring own positioning devices?
</p>
<p>
And what is their protocol on deciding when to discharge someone?
</p>
<p>
(Only things I learned was that the doctor checks at one and at six weeks).
</p>
<p>
They told me three different things about check in.  Last thing was to show up &#34;in the morning&#34;... After first telling me to check in night before.
</p>
<p>
My surgery also isn&#39;t showing in Maisa as a future appointment, which feels weird.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for answering  me before... Otherwise I&#39;d know nothing...

Self-lubrication? Also, do you know what specific kind of vaginoplasty?

Not really self-lubricating. But both skinoil and lubricant stays in well. Penile inversion vaginoplasty.
