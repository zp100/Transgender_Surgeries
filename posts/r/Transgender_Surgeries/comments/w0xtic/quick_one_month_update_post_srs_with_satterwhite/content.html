I always feel it&#39;s good to share results as we go so the community can see how things progress :). It&#39;s not always easy to find results, so figured I&#39;d share mine.
</p>
<p>
The good:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Wound breakdown is healing quite rapidly; just a little bit left on the bottom left labia majora. Compared to my last post two weeks ago, things look way better. I anticipate it should be filled in within the next 3-4 weeks.
</li>
<li>
Sensation is fantastic - was able to orgasm twice in the last 5 days or so. Surgeon said ok to masturbate, just keep things out of the vaginal canal. Orgasms themselves haven&#39;t been as powerful as before, but I assume there is still numbness to work through.
</li>
<li>
Dilation is getting easier. I&#39;m still holding at the same depth (~11.5-12cm) on the blue dilator. I&#39;m holding off on sizing up to green until wound breakdown is completely healed to prevent continued aggravation of the area.
</li>
<li>
Incision lines overall feel like they are healing quite well.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
What I&#39;m not yet happy with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I don&#39;t really have a well defined clitoral hood or labia minora. I know at this stage in the healing, the swelling masks a lot of it. Surgeon says he can very slightly see parts of the minora near the clitoris itself, but I can&#39;t. Maybe something to handle in the future on revision? Open to thoughts from the community!
</li>
<li>
The edges of the labia majora are quite prominent and easy to see (well defined border that you can obviously feel at the incisions); my hope is that over time, this will &#34;blend out&#34; into my body so there isn&#39;t this stark line.
</li>
<li>
Labia majora skin feels pretty loose. Guessing this is left over from the swelling and stretching, and once again, hoping it will resolve itself over time as the skin tightens back up.
</li>
<li>
The clitoris itself looks a bit funky as there is a defined line in the middle. Surgeon says its due to the current suturing, and once that is absorbed/dissolved, this will resolve itself.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;m working on getting in to see a pelvic floor physical therapist, as I have heard it does wonders for dilation. Also going to start using silicone ointment on the incisions to prevent scarring
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to keep some perspective for myself (though it&#39;s tough); I never had crippling bottom dysphoria (lucky me!), so I&#39;m not looking for a picture perfect vagina, but one that can pass well enough to have sexual relations.
</p>
<p>
Also fun fact - Dr. Satterwhite took leftover tissue from my urethra and put it into the vagina to give it that &#34;vagina pink&#34; color, which I thought was kind of a cool detail.

Early Satterwhite 2016 here. Had 2 revisions and I’m happy with a very nice result. Even on his site. LOL

That&#39;s awesome! Do you mind sharing what revisions you had done?
</p>
<p>
So far I&#39;m really happy with what I have so far; my only concern really is with some of the finer structures (hood, minora, fourchette if I can get it). Did yours come through on the first round?

I had many 100&#39;s of ingrown hairs under the hooding area that were grinding into my clitoris and causing severe pain. I had to have that area redone and part of the clit excised :/  and also had some scarring in the canal that made dilation more difficult than needed.  I have great depth and a perfect cosmetic result.  I am done cutting down there for sure. It&#39;s kind of a shame that their office can&#39;t seem to get their crap together on a FFS revision (I have had 3 consults and they never scheduled me for anything) - so it is looking like I will have to go elsewhere.  Shame as TS is very gifted and I always assumed that it was his old partner CC that was setting up the office politics and possibly causing competency issues in the office not related to surgery.

My girlfriend is 3 days out from SRS with Satterwhite, snoozing next to me in the hotel bed! Thanks so much for these updates, and I&#39;m glad your recovery is going well!
