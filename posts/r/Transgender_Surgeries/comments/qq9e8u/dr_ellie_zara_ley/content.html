I had a consultation scheduled with her through the meltzer clinic for November 18th. I was just called by the office though and my appointment was canceled because apparently Dr Ley is leaving the meltzer clinic. The office worker didn&#39;t have any further information, I&#39;m wondering if anybody knows where she might be moving? I&#39;m really not interested in the other doctors at the meltzer clinic and was excited to work with Dr Ley.

She is my surgeon (BA and Orchi) and we spoke at length about her leaving and it&#39;s for personal reasons, which I will not get into here, as it is her personal business. It has nothing to do with any insurance issues, etc. as some have said is the rumor-mill (as she explained it, to me).
</p>
<p>
FWIW and for what work that she did for me, she has been an excellent surgeon and I am thrilled with my results, albeit, I have not had vulvoplasty, etc.
</p>
<p>
She is going here, sometime around march 2022:

I have upcoming procedures with Dr Ley for FFS and BA. Insurance pre-auth just went through and came back. We&#39;re in the scheduling phase. Any encouragement, warnings, advice, greatly appreciated. I don&#39;t see many pictures of her work. I did however have a consult with her and I think she&#39;s incredible. ðŸ¦„

Just got an email letting me know she has moved to the Gender Confirmation Center in San Fransisco, a place that I&#39;ve worked with and had a great surgical experience with. She&#39;s seeing patients starting March 2022!!

I got the same call about a May 2022 surgery date. I was told she is leaving the state at the end of February. They offered me to move it up or have it on the same date with Dr. Meltzer. I&#39;m not sure what to do. I may even explore Dr. Esmonde in Portland.

I just heard through the grapevine that both Dr ley and Dr meltzer have had some poor results that may be resulting in insurance dropping them and probably is the reason ley is leaving. Apparently also the hospital in Portland that has given them privileges maybe revoking those privileges. This is all hearsay however I&#39;m wondering who to look to for surgery now. Doctor Stiller is in Spokane and I&#39;ll probably have a consultation with him, but what other options do we have and the Pacific Northwest without having to fly.

<p>
I know that insurance companies don&#39;t like providing GCS so I&#39;m sure any reason they can make it harder they will. I think for me I&#39;ll see about taking them up on their offer to go with Dr. Meltzer.

</p>
<p>
I had a consult with Dr. Stiller and found his office difficult and found him sorta abrasive.
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/qb8n6c/vulvoplasty_dr_nick_esmonde_meltzer_clinic/content.html" rel="nofollow">This post</a>
which mentions Dr. Esmonde at the Meltzer clinic also mentioned a poor experience with Dr. Stiller. If you&#39;re trying not to fly I think Dr. Stiller is a fine option, my GP says his work is great so the disconnect may be the office staff/personality and the actual procedure. It&#39;s probably worth looking though his site and consulting with him. They were able to provide me their surgery packed prior to the consult so even that would give you some good information about their policies.
</p>
<p>
&gt; what other options do we have and the Pacific Northwest without having to fly.
</p>
<p>
If you are okay with CA there are maybe a few option in the bay area?  Or perhaps a roadtip/train elsewhere in the country?

Dr. Stiller is a god send, he corrected a major issue another surgeon created. His office staff are human, some of them have bad days. Dr. Stiller and his assistant Riley, are wonderful. If I had to start from zero would have started with Dr. Stiller. Just my experience with it all.

I originally planned to get my vaginoplasty with Dr Meltzer and those rumors + learning about peritoneal flap vaginoplasty drove me elsewhere. Iâ€™m not exactly against them just wary, and for me, for a major surgery, that was enough to change my mind.

??? All penile-inversion techniques, and hybrid PI/peritoneal techniques use skin grafts, either split-thicknes or (more commonly) full-thickness grafts. You get a neovagina lined with keratinized epithelium for all of it or part of it. Even colon vaginoplasty uses donor skin for the introitus. What did you think you would be getting?

From my consult this was an option but not a requirement. Do you have information that it is standard practice for her? She just told me if you did the hair remove a skin graph was only needed if there wasn&#39;t enough to work with. I was planning on seeing where she ends up and maybe trying to schedule with her there.

I think you misunderstood her.  Where did you think the skin lining inside your neovagina was coming from? The donor tissue comes from your penis and scrotum. If that is insufficient, additional skin can be taken from your thigh or abdomen, but these days a peritoneal graft is usually preferred in cases where insufficient donor skin is available.

That&#39;s what exactly happened to me. My friend had her SRS with Dr. Esmonde who is also with Meltzer clinic. The office staff was able to get me an earlier appointment for consultation as well. Really hoping I can get my surgery some time next summer.

So far so good. She lives out of town so I haven&#39;t seen her yet.
</p>
<p>
I am going to the Portland location tomorrow at 9 for my consult. We should stay in touch just in case we become surgery siblings.
