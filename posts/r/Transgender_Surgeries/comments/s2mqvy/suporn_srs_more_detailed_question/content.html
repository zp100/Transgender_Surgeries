Thank you so much to many of you sisters who had shared their stories and first-hand experiences with me. After spending many days digging down Suporn related posts here, I have some new questions and things that make me worry about:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
I understood Suporn‚Äôs technique is more like a 2 stages surgery; the second one is a cosmetic improvement, which I really like the idea. I read that many girls mostly come back for the clitoris and anterior commissure reconstruction  &amp; urethral reduction. I read these posts first-hand from his patient group, although they said they like the sensation of their new vagina. Still, literally, every girl will all be eager to come back for revision; this indicates to me that they are not actually fully happy with the result, which makes me worry. Can please someone kindly elaborate a bit about these revision experiences?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When things go wrong...what can we do?  I know, I know, we all getting SRS are all hoping for a better life, and we are all here to hope we can get the best outcome. I‚Äôm sure Suporn will deliver his result too‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶. I really read a lot of posts that Suporn actually denied and refused to do any revision, when some of the girls complain that they feel botched, they don‚Äôt feel sensation with their vagina, or when they need helps for their closed vagina, etc.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These girls are actually feeling devastated when being refused further help and had to find some other surgeons to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it.
</p>
<p>
This sounds really scary and shocking to me as I would think your surgeon will be the one standing on your side, with all open hands to listen to your experiences and fix the issues you have raised.
</p>
<p>
I am not there yet, but I would be definitely feel despaired if I got refused for fixing / or revision after the main surgery.  Can I have someone share about these experiences too? It seems these are not really being mentioned much in Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

<p>
Lots? Are you sure that‚Äôs Suporn? He‚Äôs probably more open to revisions and does more than anyone else. It‚Äôs one of the key things about his technique. I can only think of one notable occasion where he flat out refused and that was because he wasn‚Äôt able to do it safely.
</p>
<p>
The number of revisions may be a bit misleading as well. Some people are going there
<em>
because
</em>
he does revisions. He‚Äôs also very expensive as Thai surgeons go, so women going there are more likely to have money to go back.

Hi! Thank you for your time reading my posts.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, it‚Äôs Suporn group, but yeah, I read a lot of posts saying they love their vagina, and they are happy with their revisions results too and assure their aesthetic looks pretty too. These are all giving me confidence and makes me want to go for him.
</p>
<p>
But I also read ‚Äúsome‚Äù posts that few sisters got rejected ( sorry, I should have used ‚Äúsome‚Äù in my above post, not like lots lots, if you get what I mean)  . One of the rejected revisions was a lady wants to go back as she stopped dilating at some point and her vagina closed; Suporn only helped her to cut some scar tissues and little vulva revisions, not help with regaining vagina width and depth.
</p>
<p>
There are a few other girls as well, and one even flied to there and got told Suporn is not doing. Although percentage wise these cases are not the majority, but they do exist, this makes me worry that it sounds like having a fix or touch up will require ‚Äúapproval‚Äù, and I just want to understand what will be like when things goes wrong ( but of course who will want this happens to ourselves before the surgery, neither of these girls too) üòä

<p>
I‚Äôd guess this is because it‚Äôs not a revision at this point, but an entire new surgery of a type he doesn‚Äôt do, ie colonvaginoplasty or peritoneal. She really should be going elsewhere to someone more experienced. I sure wouldn‚Äôt go to an inexperienced surgeon for something like this.
</p>
<p>
He has corrected rectovaginal fistulas before and that‚Äôs fairly major surgery. It‚Äôs in the Suporn PDF.
</p>
<p>
Suporn is not perfect, but then no one else is either. The good thing is there‚Äôs plenty of reviews so you can work out just what the pros and cons of going to him are.

<p>
I guess, but would we ever be
<em>
fully
</em>
happy with an SRS result? For me at least, getting SRS is about getting as close to female genitalia as I can, and if a second surgery can do that, I&#39;m down. For context, I&#39;m getting SRS with Dr. Bank in about 4/5 months, so I can&#39;t speak from personal experience yet, but I&#39;ll likely go back for the free revision if it&#39;s feasible. I&#39;ve seen a lot of results from the clinic, and their primary SRS results are still pretty damn good compared to other surgeons. However, my thought is that if I&#39;m already going in for the pain, price, and burden of primary SRS, I might as well go for lighter revision if it can greatly improve the result. Of course, you have to draw the line somewhere, you can&#39;t go for constant revisions, and you also need to accept the limitations of SRS overall. For me it&#39;s about weighing the pros and cons of each surgery, and from what I&#39;ve read primary SRS and a subsequent revision both seem to outweigh the cons,
<em>
for me
</em>
.

<p>
Outside of revisions, you accept the risks before you sign up for surgery. You spend a lot of time sitting with yourself, thinking about what you find acceptable as a result. For me, I chose a surgeon who I think will more likely than not be able to provide me with a result that&#39;s up to my standards, and I trust that I&#39;m making the best decision I can at the time being. I hope that if things go wrong, future me can accept that I did what I thought was best at the time. I can&#39;t offer a whole lot of advice but I hope you find what you&#39;re looking for! Good luck with whatever you end up deciding on!

I appreciate you reaching out to me for this post, I&#39;m happy to be of help!
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned on your last post, you need to be very aware when you look in support groups that you&#39;re going to get confirmation bias and things will look a lot worse than what the majority will deal with. People who are happy with their results and don&#39;t suffer extraneous issues won&#39;t really be posting in a support group since they don&#39;t need the support. But someone who is unhappy or has issues will seek out support groups and be posting in them for help. So you&#39;re seeing a different version of reality in those groups because they are meant to discuss issues. The frequency you see those issues does not match up at all with how few I&#39;ve seen during the multiple times I&#39;ve been to Suporn.
</p>
<p>
That being said, revisions aren&#39;t uncommon, and I&#39;ve had one myself for the purpose of getting rid of extra urethral tissue. I did get some minor cosmetic alterations while I was there, but if I didn&#39;t need to fix the initial issue, then I honestly wouldn&#39;t have bothered to even go for a revision. I was very happy with my result from the primary surgery. And I&#39;d say it&#39;s very misleading and disingenuous to say &#34;literally, every girl will all be eager to come back for revision&#34; You shouldn&#39;t go into it thinking it&#39;s a 2 stage surgery as it&#39;s really not and it&#39;s a bad mindset to be in to think from the start that you&#39;ll need to change it. Rather that if there is something(s) you want to change, it will be available to you. I&#39;m actually not sure how many other surgeons even offer revisions.
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, Suporn will only refuse to do a procedure if it&#39;s dangerous for the patient. I had heard of a girl who wanted a certain thing done but she had some special physiology in her abdomen that, if done wrong, could have possibly killed her if Suporn had attempted the procedure she asked for. He will not deny you for issues that are safely treatable. And it should be of no surprise that girls with those kinds of issues would have trouble finding other surgeons to fix it as I&#39;m sure they recognize the risk to the patient as well. I&#39;m sure these experiences aren&#39;t being mentioned much on reddit because they are incredibly rare cases. While they are possible, they aren&#39;t anything you should have as a reasonable expectation.
</p>
<p>
One thing I&#39;d also like to address is in one of your comments on this post you mentioned a woman who had her vagina close up. This is incredibly dubious as your vagina can&#39;t physically close up without some very separate issue besides missing dilation, such as surgical sites getting torn open and healing together. Our vaginas are not open wounds, the vagina is lined with tissue which is connected to our pelvic floor muscles. And for one thing, that woman who refused to continue dilating during the healing phase brought the issues upon herself, there is nothing to blame on Suporn in this case. They are very strict about constantly letting you know how bad it will be for your result if you stop dilating during the time you need it most while you&#39;re still healing. It was almost annoying how much they beat that point into you, but it&#39;s for good reason. I even met a girl at the clinic who was there for a revision who stopped dilating during the healing phase and her vagina lost a good amount of depth and penetration was hard for her because the scar tissue inside her vagina was allowed to stiffen up. The point of dilating is to
<em>
keep
</em>
the scar tissue pliable. Obviously this girl couldn&#39;t get that specific issue fixed as there&#39;s no feasible way to re-soften and lengthen that tissue once the scar tissue has firmed up.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I need to repeat again (as it&#39;s what your whole post is about) that looking in the Suporn support groups will get you mostly bad stories of issues those women are dealing with. You need to keep your mind about you that these experiences are not universal or common, you are only seeing so much of them because those groups are specifically there for support. Most women get their surgery and move on with their lives and don&#39;t stick around those groups.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to answer any questions or talk with anyone if they&#39;d like more information and experiences!

Sister, reading your comment really made my eyes wet. I feel so honoured and lucky to have you spending so much effort and timing on writing this comment. Your comments are always such details, educational, and I can see that you are genuinely generous in sharing your experiences and wanting to help the community!
</p>
<p>
You are right, the support group is there to support you, and you really made a good point on that! I am so happy to hear that you also personally had revision experience, and it was also positive!
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your real LIFE experience, and I trust that these are all true. You have been so so helpful!! I will certainly let you know again if I have more questions comes up. I really enjoyed our two ways conversation, and I also felt happy that I learned more things ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èthank you for educating me and also to other sisters who are also reading this post!

Of course, I&#39;m glad to share my experiences and help in any way I can! Everything I&#39;ve said is true, I don&#39;t want to sugar-coat things but I want to provide realistic expectations to people. I know how difficult it is to research for surgery. Before I did mine, I wanted to know everything I possibly could before I made my decision and went all in. That research is what led my to chose Suporn, though of course I understand why people might chose other surgeons over him for their own situation.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really happy my experiences can help you and others out with their decision! I&#39;ve been so happy with my results, I want other people to feel the same when they get the surgery to feel properly like themselves! :D

I don&#39;t speak from experience, but for point 1, the big
<a href="http://postopcare.github.io/static_assets/Suporn2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf
</a>
did mention that Suporn tends to leave out excess tissue because it&#39;s much much easier to remove rather than add when it comes to aesthetics revision.
</p>
<p>
Some accounts of leftover erectile tissues that can get &#34;hard&#34; do worry me a bit, however.
