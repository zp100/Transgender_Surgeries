Hi folks! First time poster, long time reader - pictures attached of approx. 3 month healing progress following vaginoplasty with
<strong>
Dr. Jess Ting at Mt. Sinai, NYC
</strong>
(early January 2022).
</p>
<p>
Incredibly happy with the results and feeling fortunate to have alleviated my bottom dysphoria (yay!). Despite my issues with their post-surgical pain support and frustrations with their disability management and follow-up case notes, I&#39;m 100% happy with the function, aesthetics, and impact to dysphoria, and feel content with my decision (I also had FFS with Dr. Ting at Mt. Sinai in January of 2021, and am happy with those results as well). There was minor wound separation along the left outer labia and granulation tissue around the vaginal canal that has thankfully mostly healed and is no longer a source of overwhelming discomfort/pain (knock on wood), residual pain is now mostly along outer scars and lingering sutures.
</p>
<p>
Candid feedback: the recovery was a gauntlet, and actually much harder than I expected; my personal experience was that the pain was completely unmanageable and when the visiting nurse called Mt. Sinai to express concern, their official response was &#34;If she&#39;s not bleeding out, there&#39;s nothing to be done.&#34; Cool!
</p>
<p>
I also had issues with their office notes accurately reflecting my challenges with recovery; as a result I was initially denied disability pay because Mt. Sinai indicated that I was fine a few weeks after surgery; this is not accurate and I have several e-mails to substantiate ongoing struggles with pain management. Thankfully, Dr. Ting was able to intercede with the leave administrator and the disability pay was retroactively approved.
</p>
<p>
The entire area is still somewhat swollen, but I&#39;m optimistic swelling will continue to decrease over the next few months as it&#39;s already gone down a ton (my vulva initially kind of looked like a balloon animal). None of these descriptions are meant to serve as a deterrent, but rather an accurate and comprehensive description of my experience (which I don&#39;t regret)! I needed a few extra weeks off of work because my stamina and ability to sit comfortably still haven&#39;t returned to normal, but around the 10 or 11 week mark there was a definite turning point around the severity and frequency of the more debilitating pain and I&#39;m starting to be able to relax and enjoy holistic embodiment and connectedness/peace with my physical form - for me, it&#39;s almost like a new sense that I&#39;m learning to process information through.
</p>
<p>
Other notable updates - initial issues with odour have largely subsided, I was using a lube that seemed to be exacerbating the problem (Brand: Good Clean Love: &#39;Almost Naked&#39; Pure, great from a comfort/functional standpoint but the impact on fragrance was... significant). Taking Good Girl Probiotic pills and switching to Surgilube along with weekly douching have reduced odour, which is now &#34;sweet and slightly musky.&#34; There are still some protruding sutures, but I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll continue to dissolve in the weeks to come. I haven&#39;t been cleared for sex yet, but have done some exploration with vibrators and the smaller end of an Njoy Pure Wand to pleasant effect. Have orgasmed once, but still working on being able to with any regularity or predictability; dilation is now mostly comfortable up to the orange one, which is often still difficult to manage. I tried to include pictures with some variety (directly, slightly open to see my inner labia, squatting, and with dilator) to get a sense of how it looks from different angles.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to reach out with questions on recovery/my personal Mt. Sinai experience (FFS or vaginoplasty)! If there is interest, I&#39;ll share another update at the 6 month mark. Thanks for reading, wishing you ease and embodiment wherever your journey takes you!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Question for other folks who have had vaginoplasties
</strong>
- did your body hair grow more aggressively following surgery? I&#39;d been on HRT for about 4.5 years and I&#39;m working with my primary care physician to manage my levels, but I&#39;ve noticed my body hair seems to be growing faster than usual and has returned in areas where it had previously largely dissipated.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also curious whether there will be any further bodily effects now that I&#39;m finally off spironolactone, and would be interested in hearing other folks&#39; experiences if comfortable sharing.  Thanks!
</p>

You never had to be on Spiro to suppress T in the first place, E does it alone.

the center where i received medical transition support prescribes spiro as part of their HRT regimen - when I first started hormone therapy several years ago, there unfortunately wasn&#39;t as much information available about E/prog overriding T w/o necessitating spiro

It&#39;s just sad that more people don&#39;t know about this/that people actively spread old school medical propaganda about people having to take Spiro. Nasty stuff.

This is heartening for me because I‚Äôm about 1.5 months out from surgery, and your results look way more like mine than others I‚Äôve seen on this sub! My labia are also fuller, and it makes it hard to compare and see how to interpret future results from swelling I have now.
</p>
<p>
How have you experienced swelling in your recovery so far? My labia feel very different over the course of the day &amp; depending on how much activity I get‚Äî they can go from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, soft labia feeling to feeling like loose skin. Like how scrotal skin can be, but my doctors told me that it has more to do with inflammation and scar tissue under the skin, because they remove the muscle layer responsible for scrotal skin retracting/expanding. Did you experience anything like that?

hooray for full labia! :)
</p>
<p>
the first month or so of swelling, they felt so swollen it was like they were being stretched to their absolute maximum, then there was a period of variability/ups and downs - like you, if I moved around more, it the swelling would flare up again, and it was kind of this tightrope walk where i was trying to get the perfect balance of ice on and ice off to minimize discomfort and prevent the &#34;overinflated balloon&#34; sensation. around the 2 - 2.5 month mark things kind of plateaued and the normal feeling is the soft labia feeling you described even with exercise and minimal sexual activity. while i still have some sensitivity and some inflammation, there was a pretty profound shift in the overall healing process (for which swelling was a huge part) just a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
wishing you minimal discomfort as you heal!

thankyou for the info, I am 1.5 months out and still very swollen and hypersensitive. I have one sitch on my clitorid andI can&#39;t wait it will dissolve and fall away, how it worked for you? do you still have annoying stitches after 3 months? I have read they can take up to 6months or even they will never dissolve at all üòü

thanks for your response! i&#39;m just over 3 months out, and I still have two protruding sutures from my clit and a third from my right inner labia - at my 3 month check-in, i was advised that they should still dissolve; they&#39;re kind of the last pieces I&#39;m waiting on which cause discomfort now that my granulation and wound separation have healed. I hadn&#39;t heard there was a chance they would never dissolve, if they&#39;re still there at 6 months I&#39;ll definitely be flagging it at my check-in.
</p>
<p>
i hope they dissolve soon for you and you start feeling better! &lt;3

I got the same, one from my clit and one in my right inner labia too. So if it&#39;s normal I will wait but I am also super scared I will need a doctor to remove them, I really hope the will fall without any doctor touching there again (it is super sensitive and I don&#39;t trust doctors here in my country)

I hope the same for you and totally agree that it would be ideal not for a doctor to have to intervene, wishing you luck.

hey, thankyou for the update woow happy for you
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t checked if my sutures are still there as I don&#39;t feel any discomfort so they could have been vanished as well
</p>
<p>
now I just feel some discomfort if I walk with leg closed, is like itching due to labia rubbing together but I just matter of get used to that with time

congrats on your appointment! mt. sinai lasered the base of the &#34;shaft&#34; and the entirety of the &#34;scrotal&#34; area over the course of six sessions; my hair is a bit lighter so i also ended up having to do about six rounds of electrolysis in addition to the laser.

good luck! :)

Thanks so much! I think my surgery was about a year and a half after my initial consultation, but a big part of the delay was because I also had FFS and a few other major life changes that required me to schedule it further out than necessary. I think this is definitely not normal - Dr. Ting&#39;s assistant Alicia should be able to provide more accurate wait times if you reach out to her directly. Sorry for my delayed response!
