<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/18bouvf/dr_rumers_astroturfedfake_reviews_are_becoming/">A few weeks ago I made a detailed post analyzing all of Dr. Rumer&#39;s &#34;shining&#34; five star google reviews.</a>
</h1>
<p>
Dr. Rumer has doubled down with two more verified fake reviews this past week using the exact same format as all of her other fake reviews. If you&#39;re new and not familiar with this doctor and her atrocities against the trans community I have posted a list of them below.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Despite being blacklisted virtually everywhere, Dr. Rumer is still continuing to lure in new victims via google where her practice will flood review sections using sock accounts. Unfortunately for her, this practice was recently outlawed by the FTC.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/zyjepz/ag_ferguson_files_lawsuit_against_seattlebased/">Recently a similar surgeon who was also using the same scummy tactics as Rumer got the attorney general raining fire down on them.</a>
</p>
<h1>
So here is the plan of action: We are going to light up the FTC&#39;s inbox and alert them to Dr. Rumer. Here is all you need to copy and paste.

And for those of you who are unfamiliar with the practice of Dr. Rumer.
</h1>
<p>
<strong>
Dr. Kathy Rumer‚Äôs atrocities, dishonesty, and disregard for the safety and well being of her patients include but are not limited to:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rumer attempts to silence two of her low income trans patients through a SLAPP suit. Rumer used a right-wing affiliated transphobic legal team and brought the case before an anti-LGBTQ Trump appointed judge:

<p>
Rumer on record threatening journalists and doctors with her right-wing lawyer:

</p>
<p>
Rumer‚Äôs staff ignore the patient&#39;s chart, prescribe medication which could be fatal to the patient:

</p>
<p>
Rumer botches FTM patient, Rumer‚Äôs staff frequently misgendered the patient:
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/xjb0ogd.png">https://i.imgur.com/xjb0ogd.png</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer denies patient surgical follow up care because of negative review (transcript at bottom of page):

</p>
<p>
Rumer ghosts patient after major complication, later instructs patient to cut off dangling labia with scissors:

</p>
<p>
Rumer casually admits to going through patients&#39; medical records in order to witch hunt her detractors and labels her own patients as ‚Äútransphobic trolls:‚Äù

I will need to check but I think my doctor has/had her on her recommended list. And if so I will recommend removing her.

Thank you for posting this, I almost went to her until I mentioned to my tattoo artist I was having surgery and he called me down real quick about how she‚Äôs the butcher, I got lucky. More people need to know and I can‚Äôt believe this lady is still practicing.

I work in gender affirming health care. In my job I‚Äôve personally encountered MANY of her former patients who need revisions because of her poor care. The number of ppl that shes ‚Äúghosted‚Äù post-op is ridiculous and they‚Äôve suffered bc of it.

Good to know.  She is semi local so i have had people mention but not much in past tense.  Even had one say that for as many as she performs in a year the volume would dictate there would be a proportional increase in error.  Not sure i vouch for that logic

Complications happen, but this is beyond reasonable complications‚Ä¶we‚Äôre talking pure neglect and botched procedures.  Also, if you‚Äôve never seen her website, check it out. Its creepy looking and off putting. She also claims to be the only surgeon in the region who takes medicaid which is 100% false.
