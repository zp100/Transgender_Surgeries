Congratsüëç  How ru feeling?  Over/under?  Silicone/Saline?  I have to tell you my breast aug was the most painful of all my surgeries except dor my first spinal fusion which was botched.  But the breast aug was very rewarding psychologically.

I‚Äôm feeling pretty good tbh. I went with silicone overs at my surgeons recommendation. This was my first surgery and is definitely the one I needed most mentally

Soooo I did have the BA done. I‚Äôll make an Alt Account in coming days and post pics. 415cc high profile over the muscle implants. Came out AMAZING! Perky, bouncy, real feel. Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with my surgery, recovery, and post care.

I am also in Nashville, and considering Vanderbilt for BA.  How was your overall experience, and how big did you go?  Also, how did you end up costing Alkassiss over Winocour?

My entire experience at Vandy was amazing! I called on 10/15, had my consultation on 10/30, and they were ready to schedule me three weeks later! I went with 415cc. Enough to lift me from a C to a DD. As for picking Alkassiss over Winocover, when I called to schedule a consolation, Winocover was booked full till December 1 and I needed to be sure my surgery was done by February 1 for insurance reasons.

<p>
Also have post op pics posted as well.. but top-to-bottom, amazing experience!
