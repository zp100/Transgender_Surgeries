The easiest way to confirm whether you have pelvic floor dysfunction is to schedule an appointment with a therapist.  They&#39;re pretty common.  If you don&#39;t, then you should talk to an MD or gastro, maybe a nutritionist.   If you had a colon graft I&#39;d suspect you have intestinal swelling, but PPT shouldn&#39;t cause that except for the initial recovery using opioid painkillers.

Thank you for your advice!! I went to two gastros and they both sent me home with laxatives and told me I look fine without even checking my pelvic floors. I had PPV at Kamol and thereâ€™s at least 4 girls in this forum that said they had constipation too ðŸ˜­

f you have been consistently taking laxatives for the past 11 months, you have almost surely developed a dependance on them.  This is why most laxatives come with a warning not to take them longer than absolutely necessary.  You should definitely schedule an appointment to see a gastro doctor to check on things and get a professional recommendation on what to do next.  Outside of that, in the past when I had issues with regularity I actually found it quite helpful to visit a colon hydrotherapy clinic.  It is all a closed system, so there is nothing overly gross about it, and it seemed to get things &#39;back in motion&#39; as it were.

Sorry to hear you are experiencing such an uncomfortable situation.  I hope it gets better for you soon.  ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

I had my surgery in November too :( i honestly think they donâ€™t even know what is causing constipation is everyone since they canâ€™t give anyone a straight answer. Itâ€™s so sad and I canâ€™t live without laxatives too

Iâ€™d be inclined to stop taking laxatives and go natural with no chemicals and just try say Olive oil , an once or less , tastes like crap but safe and let your natural bacteria do itâ€™s job through out the intestinal system so it recovers without pills ?

You need to significantly increase your fiber.  Make eating fiber though your diet your highest priority.  Dramatically lower your intake of Meat, dairy and eggs soo your god guy bacteria can grow back.  Whole grains are going to be important to help grow good gut bacteria.
