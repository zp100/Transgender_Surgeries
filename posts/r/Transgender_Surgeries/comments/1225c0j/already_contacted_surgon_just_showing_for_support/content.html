Thanks just doing my best. Hardest part is the fecal matter discharge it was the one complications I prayed not to get.
</p>
<p>
My problem is not a rare complication.. tons of CIS women get problems like this from pregnancy. Only time will tell and help.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the support.

Sorry I had fallen asleep I have two types of discharge. One from the vagina it&#39;s normal Il call it blood. The other is when I have a bowel movement I notice discharge from in between where the skin seperated. While I wipe it&#39;s in it. The fecal matter

I’m so sorry to know your going through this, sending positive vibes &amp; prayers that things will get better. Just out if curiosity you didn’t have any fistulas prior to surgery did you?

I was considering great health 161 lbs. I&#39;m 6 foot 2 so healthy BMI
</p>
<p>
I had no problems other then internal hemorrhoids that&#39;s it. Which were checked by my GP. Nothing was wrong.
</p>
<p>
Even this fistula would close if the perianal stitch was held. I can have normal bowel movements I just notice leakage out that in-between spot due to how the surgery lines everything up.
</p>
<p>
It luckily does not go into my vagina. Even with dialation.

Well that’s a really big plus that you are having regular bowel movements &amp; only some leakage, because it could be so much worse.
</p>
<p>
I actually suffer with perianal fistulas, an my file is currently being assessed at Montreal, for Brassard to be my surgeon lol. ideally would go for full depth but the issue is running into something like this, which is scary. (Sending your strength) they will probably deny me full depth after dealing with your case, even though your saying it’s actually common complication.
</p>
<p>
I wish you luck an another plus is your still able to dilate:)
</p>
<p>
I look forward to Monday so you can get answers.

I hope you get cleared and my case doesn&#39;t effect anything.  Yes I am still very lucky it is not a complete fistula, it might even be over wording it calling it that.
</p>
<p>
I just want to be as transparent as possible for everyone that in my case yes I am noticing leakage when I&#39;m whiping and using the bathroom.
</p>
<p>
I will update my post as I get more information aswell so that it can be looked at for future reference.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the supporting message.
</p>
<p>
I am also very glad I can still dialate so I still can maintain depth
</p>
<p>
Also the pain is manageable by taking only Tylenol and advil together. I cannot take opiates as they make me vomiting sick.  That is another plus..

I&#39;m sorry that this is happening.  I flew first class too from YUL to YVR for the same reasons and I hope that it heals quickly for you with no further complications.  I wish I could do more than say good luck.

At this point luck is the one thing I seem to need on my side. I&#39;ve always had troubles with healing things I&#39;m like always the person to get random complications like vomiting from tramadol or the opiates they gave me.
</p>
<p>
I do think it will heal on its own. I&#39;m not super panicked. More just dissapointed in the fecal matter discharge.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the support regardless of what you say talking helps.

I hope you had a good flight aswell that would be a long one. Mine was only 3 hours.

I really struggled with the Oxy and Tramadol that Montreal gave me.  Like, it worked and I was feeling no pain but the next day I would feel so gross and fuzzy like a bad hangover.  I lived across the street from a pharmacy and they gave me something else but, even just a year, later I can&#39;t remember what it was.  Maybe a higher strength Tylenol?  Perhaps that might help with the pain?

It might Tylenol with codeine is another alternative. I just dislike the heavy strength pain killers most cause constipation or are terrible for your liver.
</p>
<p>
Weed edibles, Tylenol extra strength, and one advil/ibuprofen is making it manageable. The pain is when I try to use the 4 dialator it just stretches me too far and doesn&#39;t feel remotely good. So been following there other suggestion of 2 and then 3 which is working. I am actually dialating as I write this.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not exactly a size queen so if I don&#39;t ever get the 4 width il be okay. I still can get all the dialators to the last dot. So depth has not changed.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the suggestion though. If it does get worse I will be looking for something stronger from my GP
</p>
<p>
Ps to my knowledge the opiates stay in your system for up to 72 hours. So lots have that dizzy drunk gross feeling. Only 25% get vomiting. Unfortunately that&#39;s me.

I am assuming that you are Canadian as well... Molson has this THC beer called Mollo available here and I would have a couple of those here and there in the first few weeks.  10/10 would recommend.

I am Canadian yes, I don&#39;t drink beer but I will keep it in mind as a medical tool to help pain. Thanks that was not something I had thought about. I am fortunate my mom makes edibles and sent me a batch of brownies.

Taking the 1g Tylenol and 400mg ibu together helps with the pain a lot better than either separately or alternating.  Just making sure you know.

Do you mean like marfans or EDS? I might, but not be diagnosed I tend to have joint problems my whole family does.  My dad had to get knee replacement surgery twice once in twenties and again recently at like age 50.

Yep one of those, but I&#39;m not a medical professional, EDS just came to mind as a possibility after reading about it earlier in the week, and just now seeing your complication. The article I recall mentioned a special kind of stitching to do with deep tissue, but I&#39;m not sure. You&#39;re quite bruised up too which is another indicator of EDS. If it is EDS you could take a while to heal and have a tendency to bleed more too, and more risk of prolapse. I dont have any advice though, sorry!

Interesting il keep it in mind if I have to go get re-stitched. I oddly like never bruise so it was quite concerning how dark my butt got I had super bad burises the worst I&#39;ve ever had
</p>
<p>
I will keep it in mind also and try to be extra careful. As if it could be plausible. Might be something to ask my GP.

I had dehiscence almost as bad.  I was told to keep it clean, and it would heal by itself.  It did after about 4-6 weeks.  but that is quite wide, so may need a little stitching.  Long term you should be okay but definitely check with the surgeon and do what they say.  Good luck.

It was a 3 hour flight. It might not even happen, though. The moving walking I think was also allot on my body.  So if you can wheelchair through the airport it might help.

Yikes, good luck. You seem to be handling this very calmly and effectively.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
To be honest, if it&#39;s an option I would even say &#34;pat dry with sterile surgical gauze&#34;, given how much it has opened up.

I am lucky I did not go into this blind I&#39;ve done years of research and study I sorta wanted to become a trans doctor to help others so I do have a bit of a farther medical background.
</p>
<p>
At this point the best thing has been a peri bottle and patting dry and then tons of air dry to allow time to heal.  I have a bunch of sterile stuff, also I have been making saline solutions as well Infection is the last thing I want right now.
</p>
<p>
I was also lucky or unlucky enough to do palaitive care for both my Grandparents in my parents house so have seen bed sores and other medical things and learnt how to treat them.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the support and advice I&#39;ll probably get some of that as well.  Brassard is actually phoning me tomorrow to discuss a plan.
</p>
<p>
At this point I&#39;m pretty sure it will be me going to a local hospital to be re-stitched in the perianal area. Which will close the fecal area. Then a huge round of antibiotics again.
</p>
<p>
I apologize if I rented or have poor grammar at this point I&#39;m quite hoped on medication and THC to manage pain. To avoid opiates and the vomiting it caused.

Unfortunately you won&#39;t. It would be asking to much of my immediate supports around me to go through 10 years of med school. They never signed up for that so why make them do that. Maybe nurse though.

It looks scary mentally it&#39;s scary. In terms of complications or medical it is one of the most common complications of Any surgery and CIS women who go through pregnancy have similar risks.
</p>
<p>
It can be fixed it just takes time.  Try not to let it scare you or anyone else for that matter into not wanting surgery.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the kind supporting words.

Praying for you 🤲, I also had srs recently on 7 March in Thailand from dr theerapong (sigmoid SRS) they didn&#39;t discharged me until my stitches completely healed and dr cut them 80%, and they don&#39;t allow you to leave Thailand for at least one month for any complications. Even though I&#39;m almost recovered it&#39;s been 21 days and I still sometimes get scared that I&#39;ll tear it from dilation and gonna cause fistula or it&#39;s gonna fall.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s right surgeries like these are not easy 🙏

That’s rough.   I have a fistula as well.  From my rectum to my vagina canal.    Contact your surgeon.    Have them send a referral to a urologist.   Have them fix it.  Then go back to your surgeon for a revision.   It’s exactly what I’m going through.  It’s a rough process but you’ll get through it

I have to get a secondary revision to fix it, sometime in the next year it will be covered by my province, done back at Montreal, I had PI, with brassard as that&#39;s the only way it is done.

PI means penile inversion. If you have any questions I don&#39;t mind answering to my best ability.
</p>
<p>
There is other techniques done. Just not by brassard.
</p>
<p>
PPT. Is another form. Bassicly some of the canal is made with some stomach intestine,
</p>
<p>
Sigmoid colon.
</p>
<p>
And the non standard penile inversion.
