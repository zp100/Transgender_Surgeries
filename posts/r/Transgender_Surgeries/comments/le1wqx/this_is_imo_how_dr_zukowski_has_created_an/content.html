Can they really sue you from sharing your feelings and experience online? 😶 Sounds more like intimidation, but I&#39;m just a random internet person idk.

No he can not. He can sue me but typically the goal is to scare. You can sue anyone for anything, will he have a case? most likely not.

Is it really possible to charge defamation if the services provided were objectivity lacking? What was the right move here legal wise?
</p>
<p>
Are consumers supposed to hide their experiences in fear of companies or practices suing them?

It depends on how you share the opinion and what they did about it.
</p>
<p>
I work medical and will provide an example: A patient comes in for a minor surgery that shouldn&#39;t leave a scar but it leaves one anyway for various reasons. This person goes on to social media and says the surgeon / hospital is terrible, unprofessional, etc.  That is legally defamation.
</p>
<p>
If this person instead said objectively: &#34;I was told I wouldn&#39;t have a scar and I now have a scar, I&#39;m disappointed in the facility and the surgeon who said I wouldn&#39;t&#34; then that&#39;s not defamation at all
</p>
<p>
I&#39;M NO LAWYER!!! However, for this case with the comments in the letters, it may be a pretty easy defemation case on the Dr.s part. The letters may seem intimidating but they are actually standard legal letters they are required to send out before they persue other legal actions.
</p>
<p>
If OP can prove that their issues would have arose due to the Dr.s practice of medicine and not any other factors, then they will be able to get it throne out, but that&#39;s a pretty hard uphill battle that will likely require them hiring other medical professionals to give their opinions.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Best route to take if a surgeon botches your surgery.  Contact patient relations with the medical facility, or contact the surgeon directly. Inform them of the issues at hand and allow them the ability to fix it.  If you&#39;re uncomfortable with them doing it, let them know so they can arrange for compensation so you can have it fixed elsewhere.  If they refuse the fix, contact a local lawyer and the local medical board. So long as you can you prove that you took the proper aftercare and steps to achieve full and proper recovery and that the issues are on the end of the surgeon / facility, then you can get to reimburse your payment for the original surgery and current legal fees,as well as compensation for damages and pay for your fix

Actually, saying someone is not good or is bad is not defamation. it would be hard to prove that a doctor is either good or bad as it’s subjective to the opinion of the reviewer. I can subjectively talk about my surgery or even say that a doctor is unprofessional. It’s a matter of opinion and would have to be proved other wise. A person standards of what is and is not is professional is subjective.  Now if I said a doctor left a scar but did not leave a scar then that would be stating a fact that could be disproven or proven. Or if I said a certain restaurant had rats but they did not again same thing. One is opinion and the other is fact.

The fact here is that your making accusation against him. Your saying you&#39;re experiencing X issues due to HIM. That is a statement that directly effects his reputation as a surgeon and counts legally as defamation. Just because something counts as defamation doesn&#39;t mean it will hold up in court.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the burden of proof falls on you to prove that that either 1) the issues you&#39;ve experienced are due to this surgeon and his actions or 2) to prove in front of a judge that your remarks had no negative effect on his reputation on a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
For him though, all he has to do is find a single person who says your comments had a negative effect on their view of him and explain how those effects could occur through lack of patient after care, natural deviation, etc. And then find a single remark that could be taken as libel. It could be literally a single sentence out of your entire online comment history about him.
</p>
<p>
The best course of action for you, if you honestly believe this isn&#39;t defamation and don&#39;t think this will hold up in court, would be to lawyer up and take him to court both for damages and for use of the legal system as intimidation tactic. If you have plenty of evidence, then that should be a slam dunk.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if he DOES take this to court, then every comment on this post displaying any negativity towards him can act as evidence in his case against you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not siding with either of you btw, my opinion is my own on this but please seek a lawyer if you&#39;re going to continue

Good for you. Keep that evidence and seek a lawyer so you can get medical and mental damages. Again, sounds like a slam dunk in that case

I never gave my opinion on this surgeon. And I realize you never asked advice. This is a public forum. If you post stuff, expect others to comment and offer advice, opinions, etc. That&#39;s how forums work.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not going to respond after this. Again though, please seek legal counsel and I do hope that you&#39;re able to get the proper recompense so that you can the body you want.

Well, here&#39;s the thing.
<em>
Most
</em>
of what you said isn&#39;t actionable (as it is subjective and a matter of opinion), but some of it actually is. For example, specific claims about him pressuring you into certain actions are actionable because they are a matter of
<em>
objective
</em>
truth (i.e. true vs false instead of subjective opinion).
</p>
<p>
Will he sue you? Eh...maybe. The more you post about it, the more likely that will become. He or someone close to him is probably looking for posts concerning this issue and scanning the responses to see if it is noticeably affecting his reputation as a surgeon. If it is, then he just might take you to court over it.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Claims such as &#34;he&#39;s not a good doctor&#34; and &#34;he&#39;s sloppy&#34; are generally pretty inactionable because the definitions of &#34;good&#34; and &#34;sloppy&#34; are subjective. Even going so far as to say &#34;he botched my surgery&#34; is likely inactionable because the definition of &#34;botched&#34; is also quite subjective in some cases (though noticeably less so than &#34;good&#34; or &#34;sloppy&#34; because there is a generally accepted point past which whether or not a surgery was &#34;botched&#34; becomes obvious and universally understood, which gives it a more objective quality). In other words, you can say
<em>
a lot
</em>
in a review without crossing any kind of legal line. It might be deleterious to the subject&#39;s reputation, sure, but legally, not much can be done. The point where you cross the line is when you make specific objectively true-or-false claims about his actions, such as &#34;he pressured me to do x&#34;. While the definition of &#34;pressured&#34;
<em>
can
</em>
vary, it generally means the same thing to different average laypeople, which gives the word objectivity. Does that make sense?

That’s okay though. I’m not worried about him suing me. Granted if he lied on the stand my case would become far more difficult but feeling “pressured” or “pushed” is subjective. And that I can prove with his own statements.

Yes and no. The meaning of &#34;pressured&#34; is more universally understood than many verbs, so a claim that someone pressured you to do something (
<em>
especially
</em>
within the power dynamic between a doctor and a patient) is
<em>
far
</em>
more actionable. Now, if you have proof that he did indeed force this on you,  then that&#39;s different. At that point, he&#39;s pretty screwed. In this case, I imagine the proof would take the form of a specific statement or series of statements that you would claim that he made and that he would attest to making. His case would be DOA in deposition and subsequently tossed out if that happened.

And you are right. Though It didn’t actually say “pressured” I think that is what his lawyer stated Had been stated. The statement made in actual comment was “pushed”

That does indeed sound like pushing, not pressuring. That&#39;s an important distinction. &#34;Pushing&#34; entails urging while &#34;pressuring&#34; entails compulsion (or an attempt to compel).

OMG the fact that he stated white privilege shows that he probably f up and is trying every little thing possible.
</p>
<p>
So now white people also need to be butchered by surgeon to not be privileged? It’s funny how your white privileged didn’t bother him when you paid for the surgery?

It&#39;s definitely defamation. You can&#39;t just make accusations like those in a post. You can certainly write a review that&#39;s true and honest about your experience, but you can&#39;t just make  sweeping generalizations based on hearsay --even if you believe they are true.

Kinda seems like he&#39;s being an asshole, also I find it odd that he calls out white privilege on this one as he appears to be white himself?  Maybe I&#39;m wrong on that.

He is like butcher Bart Van de Ven. They keep botching patients yet fans still recommend them putting others in danger. I think the butchers and their fans should be banned from all trans forums.

The reviews seem mixed but kind of low, the photos are nice, this letter is shocking to read... it&#39;s all very intimidating to see over hopeful FFS

I&#39;ve gotta say, solely based on your posts/comments and this letter from Dr. Z, he comes across as much more reasonable. And I have read a LOT of trans women complain about him, so I&#39;m hardly giving him the benefit of the doubt.
</p>
<p>
What is your concern regarding sharing pre-op photos? That to me comes across as a reasonable request- people can look and make their own judgement, rather than relying on your word.
</p>
<p>
I saw your post saying he recommended 425cc as &#34;conservative&#34;, and somehow forced you into this size. His comments mirror feedback I&#39;ve heard from other trans women who went smaller on their implant size and regretted it. I think any good doctor would inform a patient &#34;based on my experience with previous patients, I&#39;d recommend x, y, z&#34;, and is hardly forcing you into anything. Also, what the hell is his angle on giving you bigger boobs? IIRC it&#39;s not like he&#39;s making extra $$ because the implant is bigger.

Update: Zukowski never actually sued me, his lawyer which was not licensed to practice law in my state just sent threatening letters. I haven’t wanted to push it further. Statue of limitation is one year. He has since botched multiple other patients one is now my close friend and have her nose rebuilt with Dr. Jumaily. I had all my work revised with Deschamps and will be posting an update after my rhinoplasty in March. Deschamps stated after removing the cheek implants that they were crooked. I’m finally having my breast implants removed in a couple months and will just go with out for the time being. I spent most of the year after surgery with Dr Z extremely depressed and suicidal. He is the biggest regret of my life.

Think of Donald Trump&#39;s arrogant attitude that he is the ONLY one who can do anything right, bad mouthing everyone else- this accurately describes &#34;club hands&#34; himself. Only he is the expert.
