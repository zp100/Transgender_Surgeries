I had my 3 months post-op appointment recently, so I figured that I&#39;d post an update. Everything healed really well. Dr. Morath also told me that she does not think that I&#39;d need a revision but that I could always make another appointment if I felt the need for one. Not really sure what else to write, if you happen to have questions, feel free to ask and I will gladly answer them .:)

In my opinion, this looks super good! :)  I have an appointment with Morath &amp; Sch√∂ll soon, too. Some questions, please answer only if you feel like it: üôà Is there a reason why you chose Morath over Sch√∂ll? And maybe more importantly, how satisfied are you with the results over all - and especially functionality-wise?  Wish you all the best! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Oh I can totally answer that. I chose Dr. Morath because I had my appointment with her in like September 2019 or something. I think that was around the time when she and Dr. Schaff separated and so Dr. Sch√∂ll was not really on my radar. But my interactions with him while I was in hospital were positive. He was nice and professional and did not do anything different regarding the aftercare.
</p>
<p>
And personally I am really happy about my result. Sure, here and there there could be some small adjustments be done, like some parts healed a tiny bit funky at like a 5¬∞ angle instead of straight. Or I am having a tiny bit of access skin right at the scar on one of my labia majora but like in my opinion these small imperfections do not warrant the risks of having another surgery. If I had some bigger complications like for instance the angle of the urethra being wrong resulting in potentially peeing outside of the toilet or having the urethra a little too tight resulting in having difficulties peeing at all, then I might&#39;ve considered having some parts slightly altered but that is luckily not the case. And I think it also adds some flair to it?? Like....nature is not symmetrical either ao why does my culva have to be, you know??  Everything functions as it should. The clitoris is sensitive, I can pee without any issues, the different skin transplants all healed well, my vaginal canal is only around 5 cm but that was out of my own request of putting most care on the outer parts and having depth as a super secondary aspect. But the vagina also healed well and yeah I really do not have anything I could complain about. Oh and thank you :)

Oh hi, don&#39;t worry about posted under my poat here, that is why I made it in the first place. :) I reached my 1 year mark very recently which I might make a post about soonish.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is there but I gotta say it is a bit different than pre-surgery. But it might just be that the part of the glans that was used to create the clitoris is a different area than what I would have touched to feel sexual stimulation. Never asked my surgeon about it so I can&#39;t say for sure. But(!!!) the satisfaction is absolutely there and everything works well, no issues to climax.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise I am also satisfied with my result but I gotta say that I do want a correction surgery in the future. Keep in mind though that the surgery was planned as a 2 stage approach. And my issues are fairly minor and I think they should be easily fixable. I have some excess erectile tissue that interferes with the angle of my urethra and that also looks a bit too big when arroused. And I also got a bit too much skin for my outer labias.(which makes sense cause I decided that I wanted a minimal depth approach so the lack of depth lead to more skin in the outer area)
</p>
<p>
So right now I&#39;d rate my result like a 8-9/10.

I think around 5cm. I can&#39;t really tell the exact depth cause measuring that is not that easy :D My dilators are made out of foam so do not have those dots that the usual ones got. But I should mention that having less depth does not mean that I do not have to dilate at all. I still have to follow the regimen. The one advantage is that reach the end with my finger so I was always able to tell if I was dilating correctly or not cause if I didn&#39;t there would have been some tightness at the end.
</p>
<p>
I pretty much only went for it because 1.) I am not super interested in penetration at all and I am lesbian so the chances of toys being involved is significantly higher and I just don&#39;t think that I&#39;d need like a regular depth to potentially enjoy it. And 2.) because there are obviously limitations in the sense that there was only so much material they could use and my main priority was in a good looking vulva and thus depth was also a very secondary priority for me. They could&#39;ve done a skin graft to ensure that I&#39;d get both but yeah, I really did not care about depth so that&#39;s how it resulted to a depth of about 5cm.

Hey I would be very interested after this year now how you feel with the minimal depth OP. I am thinking about zero vs. minimal depth (I am a lesbian too) and I am not sure how much difference it would make for me. And if the work with dilating and the additional OP risk is worth it for me... so I would love to hear your thoughts about it with your experience having done the minimal depth OP.

Wow what an incredible result! Thank you for sharing!
</p>
<p>
What has recovery been like? Seems like things were pretty healed by 6 weeks. How long until you could do all the same things as you could pre-op (assuming you‚Äôve reached that point)?
</p>
<p>
Also what is your dilation regimen?

I did not have any complications so in that regard recovery went pretty well. But this was also my very first surgery ever so I was not prepared at all how difficult it still would be. I&#39;d say the hardest part was not being able to sit or rather not being able to sit comfortable and not for a long time and also that my daily life pretty much revolved around dilating for the first few weeks. I&#39;d say at around the 6 weeks point the stitches of the vulva were healed for the most part but the vagina was still healing, the 8 weeks point I was feeling okay again and now after 3 months I am absolutely back to normal.

Yes, German health insurance paid for almost  everything. I had to pay 3k euros out of pocket though. I am pretty sure that you could also get the surgery with her out of pocket if you are not from Germany but I really can&#39;t tell you how much it would cost.

Yeah you got all these amazing doctors but the availability for pretty much any healthcare service is so gatekept behind your own personal finances or having the right job that does offer you a good health insurance. But it does seem like the public opinion regarding that topic slowly seems to shift, no?

What was the formal procedure to get to Dr Morath with German health insurance? A doctor referring you? I&#39;m asking because even though I&#39;m not from Germany, I&#39;m still a EU citizen and I think there&#39;s something about that EU citizens should have access to the same health care as the citizens of the individual nation.

Uhhh. Step 1: getting a therapist Step 2: getting hormones Step 3: making an appoinment with Dr Morath. I believe it did cost around 50‚Ç¨ back then. Afterwards she gave me a letter to prove that I had this appointment with her and that she informed me about the surgery, the risks and so on. Step 4: sending letters to my health insurance that proved that I had enough therapy, was on hormones for long enough and that I had the appointment with my surgeon and that the surgery was also medically necessary.
</p>
<p>
In your case I would check what the exact kind of requirements your country has and you would probably also need some kind of proof that you would not receive the same quality of care in your country. Or some kind of proof four your health insurance that going to a different surgeon would actually be beneficial not only for you but also for them because they would save money that way. I know what you are talking about regarding this EU law but idk how one can actually make use of it, sorry :/

As far as I can see there are also many great options in other parts of the world but I do think that we have great surgeons here in Germany that at the very least could be a good potential option for people in Europe. :)

How expensive was it? I&#39;m from Denmark where it&#39;s completely free to get, only problem is the waiting time. It&#39;s approximately 4 - 20 years of waiting, so I&#39;m considering having it done either in Montreal or Germany.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;m making the money for the operation my self, by doing hard labour, I&#39;m not in a good economic place, so making the money is super hard.

I honestly do not know the exact cost but my guess would probably be around 20k euros?? Different surgeons might have different costs though. Sorry to hear that the wait times are so bad in Denmark :/

I only get exact numbers from Morath in June, but I think around 25k out of pocket seems realistic..

initially it was German for saying that they use the scrotal skin (and later the urethra mucosa too) for the vaginal lining to have more of the penile tissue available for doing the vulva - some would argue they sneekily looked at some Thai-Surgeons work, tho essentially i think it&#39;s just a refined form of PI in one form or another - really depends on the surgeon

Yeah I think that&#39;s pretty much it. Combined method pretty much means that penile skin + mucous skin from the urethra + the inner lining of the scrotum are being used to get more potential depth but also to be less restricted by the limitations of penile inversion. Like in my case part of the labias were made out of penile skin but with PI that would not be the case.

Oh hi, I honestly do not know wether she also offers it or not, sorry. I think that would be a good question to ask during a consultation. I never planned for this type of vaginoplasty so I personally never asked. :/

I generally would say no, at least I do not think that penetration without lube would be possible. It does get messy and kinda wet but yeah....I would not really call it self lubrication.

she is very nice, lovely. Thank you for sharing. Shows me that minimal depth is a good option for us. Do you know if there is an option without the need of dialating? I do not like the idea of any penetration.

I am sure that you could also get an option without any need for dilation at all but I think that&#39;s a question best asked for the surgeons cause it probably also depends on the surgical method they are doing. In my case part of the reason why I have to dilate is that I was also having a transplant to create the vagina whicg resulted in a ring scar. Scar ring?? Not sure which one is the correct term. Basically this scar wants to constrict during the healing oeriod and I need to counteract that.

it is supposed to be the upper part of the small labias, the part that connect to the clitoral hood. I know that this area is a bit different compared to what you&#39;d see in a natal vulva but keep in mind that the very nature of the complexity of this surgery kind of means that one might have to accept that not everything is !00% correct size-,shape, or positionwise.  But I personally do not mind that.

there is always the option to discuss a certain level of wishes with the surgeon right before surgery and even after surgery one could always get a revision if some aspects might not have resulted in the desired aesthetic. Of course there are limitations but at the same time there is absolutely some wiggle room in what is possible. Most importantly I think doing your research and going with an experienced surgeon is the most important thing to do and I would say there are definitely multiple good surgeons in Germany. Get a consultation with a few of them, try to talk to people who went to these surgeons to get a more informed idea how good they are and I am sure you&#39;ll end up with a good result. :)
