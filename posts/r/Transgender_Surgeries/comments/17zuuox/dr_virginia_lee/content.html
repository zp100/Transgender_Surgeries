UPDATE: After my in-person consult, I&#39;m very excited and feel confident about working with Dr. Li! She&#39;s super nice and thorough, seems like she really cares about her work. She uses what she described as &#34;a play on penile inversion technique&#34;, involving something about tucking excess erectile tissue into the abdomen (I know for a fact i&#39;m describing that wrong, I was very overwhelmed so I don&#39;t have the medical details right 😭). Her work looks very very good, and she takes pains to make sure it looks natural for each patient&#39;s body and body type. Kaiser girls, we&#39;re in good hands with her.
</p>
<p>
Typo in title I didn’t catch until later: Her name is Dr. Virginia Li, not Lee
</p>
<p>
So I got my SRS referral with Dr. Roderick Simonds at Kaiser NorCal and thought he was going to be my surgeon. There’s barely any info about his work as is, but then I found out he’s retiring at the end of this year and his cases are going to be taken over by
<a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/virginiali" rel="nofollow">Dr. Virginia Li</a>
</p>
<p>
She’s very new from the looks of it. There’s nothing on the sub or the wiki about her, and I can’t find anything online. Does anyone know anything about her? New blood is a good thing for trans medicine, but I want to prioritize experience in my surgeon above all else. Kaiser is the only place I can get surgery, so I’m spiraling a little over this. Would appreciate any input!

A lot of new Trans docs are coming online since insurances now accept srs.  At a minimum I’d want to know who she trained under.

I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s up to the employer and would want to see a citation for that. I don&#39;t think an insurance company can prevent the coverage of a procedure due to the ACA banning that discriminatory practice, especially in California, where we are a protected class. I&#39;m fairly certain the only states that get away with it are only the ones that didn&#39;t expand Medicaid with the federal funding appropriated by that legislation.

I have an explicit exclusion in my employers healthcare that excludes any coverage of anything that is related to gender transition. BCBS even denied the coverage of my therapist because the determination was gender dysphoria.  Each person circumstance can be different. It will vary by state requirement for sure. My coverage was BCBS of Texas, i’m jn MD where there are laws, but I’d have to pursue it in court to seek the coverage which I’m not sure I wanted to do with an employer who is willing to exclude that coverage and still work there.  My answer to it was - I recently left, I’ll get private coverage and once I can check the coverage I’ll look to seek reimbursement for future procedures based on a reaffirmed gender dysphoria diagnosis in the new year. I may be benefit for electrolysis, hair transplant etc. I’ll see what I can get.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has i out on what could be covered with reason insurance I’d love to hear.

I had bottom surgery with Simonds. I&#39;m over 2y post-op now. Sensation is good, but aesthetic is pretty low, and I have a complication wherein I don&#39;t pee straight, which hasn&#39;t bothered me enough for a revision until now. Part of my urethra split open like the flowers of a petal blooming. I feel like it wasn&#39;t set up to heal well and is just failing now. So I am going to see Dr. Li to get an exam 1/11. I can report a vibe check afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Also keep in mind if you have Kaiser you&#39;re not necessarily stuck with the one surgeon they tell you about. My gf got sigmoid colon bottom surgery through Kaiser sf bay area 6m ago with Dr. Salim. You can push for other surgeons, especially if you&#39;re not interested in the standard PIV surgery. Ymmv, but don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions and push for what you desire and what makes you comfortable.

That’s really helpful thank you! I honestly hadn’t considered pushing for Salim or someone else, I’ll keep my mind open. Best of luck with your exam, would love to hear about the vibes.

I got pretty good vibes from her. She was much more active talking to me than Simonds (he seemed largely checked out) and Thomas (Simonds old partner who assisted in my surgery, he was quite dismissive). She is unconcerned that my stated issue will cause any real problems, offered a revision if I want and described how she would do it and what the results would be (including a warning that it would likely decrease my vaginal width a little bit) and talked through some possible solutions to the pain and bleeding I&#39;ve had and she expects my internal skin is just easily torn. I don&#39;t feel super great about my personal situation nor the solutions she offered but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a problem with her, I think that&#39;s just my body being more fragile than I want it to be.
</p>
<p>
My fav thing is that she wasn&#39;t afraid to talk through her thoughts with me. I get better vibes from her than Simonds (who wasnt bad, just tired and ready to retire). Hope that is somewhat helpful!

That’s really good to hear, thank you! It’s a great sign that she’s more communicative I think. I’m sorry you’re caught in a tough witch, I hope it ends up working out. I really appreciate you sharing &lt;3

Thread revival- has anyone had vaginoplasty with Dr. Lee and care to share info about the experience?  I had Dr. Simonds for a phone consult.  While I haven’t heard anything from Kaiser MST, I’m assuming I’m now part of Dr. Li’s caseload.

Same same. Just got my referral for Dr. Li. Trying to find out as much information as I can about her. I understand that she is relatively new. But I like what I&#39;ve been reading so far that she&#39;s got got good vibes. I have a phone consultation with her in June.

The &#34;Mental Health Professional&#34; that I talked with (SRS with Kaiser requires 2 different therapists/mental health professionals to be approved for it), said when I talk to the nurse I can ask them to put a note for them to refer me to a specific surgeon. Apparently there are now 4 of them at Kaiser. Did some research on each. Seems Winnie Tong mostly does FTM/MTF top surgeries, but does do bottom also, most posts on here have been FTM patients. Ali Salim has been doing SRS since 2007 and is the most well known of the surgeons from NorCal Kaiser. Christopher Loftus is new to Kaiser, but came from another gender clinic, looks like most the posts from google are about urology, but he&#39;s the only one offering PPT at NorCal Kaiser. Apparently even has a method for using peritoneal flaps for zero depth to full depth. Apparently yet to do any surgeries as he just came on a month or so ago, but should start scheduling soon. Then Virginia Li which has already been talked about on here, clearly green, but also seems like she&#39;s trained under some very good surgeons and got a fellowship, which not many doctors are awarded. Very interested to see her work so far and talk to her about probably some newer techniques then older ones that have been doing them for a decade or more. Apparently for zero depth she doesn&#39;t require hair removal, but you can opt to do it anyway.
</p>
<p>
Even if they can do me sooner, I&#39;m pretty much 2 years out for financial/running my own business reasons and have to prepare my business for me to not be in the field for at least a month and guessing the first week will be extra rough, so maybe by two weeks I can be doing remote work on my laptop with tray over me laying down. Did that the day after my orchiectomy and continued until about 10 days, where I could be out in the field for short bouts.
</p>
<p>
So I think if I do like Dr. Li that at least she&#39;ll have some more experience under her belt by the time she does me.

Haven’t heard anything yet. They’re supposed to reach out for routine check ins every couple of months so I suppose the first one will be coming up soon. Simonds was very enthusiastic about Li’s experience and skill level but…idk. This is my only option right now or for the foreseeable future but it’s still alarm bells for me.

So...January update - it&#39;s true.  Dr Simonds will retire at the end of this month and his patients are being transferred to Dr Virginia W Li.  The nurse didn&#39;t volunteer this - I had to pry, and once I did they gave me the info.  Dr Li apparently specializes in Vaginoplasty and was hired by KP specifically for that, and has already done several.  I have a video call with her in February to essentially do the meet-and-greet and basic questions.

Ugh that’s so annoying that they’re so uncommunicative - I also had to pry it out of the nurse I talked to. What I’ve heard about Li so far seems good though, fingers crossed that she’ll get us right! Thanks for the update.

I was referred to Sr Simonds and saw him in the spring for my initial consult. I iust spoke with the nurse at that clinic to try and see if I could get another consult, and much to my surprise, i was told that I was also switched to Dr Li, and was apparently was told this per their charting in September. BS!! I would have remembered being told I was being switched to a green surgeon who has done ~90 vaginoplasties in her career!! Wtf!

Right?? I was told that she specialized entirely on this during her residency which is a plus but I’m just not sure. I’m gonna stay in the pipeline and continue my hair removal plan either way, and once I get to the actual consult with Li herself I’ll make the decision. Who knows, maybe some magic health insurance will come along and broaden my options lol

I have an office visit with her on 2 Jan. I can report back a vibe-check for you. May you ask the role of the person who informed you that she did these during her residency? I&#39;m a RN, so would be genuinely disappointed if this was passed on by a fellow nurse, because that is a gross mischaracterisation of her experience--your were provided misinformation that was easily preventable.  Let me clear the air a little bit on what they should have told you: She did a fellowship there which is for all intents and purposes an advanced residency. Fellowships are entirely voluntary, whilst residencies are not. One tends to do these programmes in order to develop an expertise in that area if specialty. It&#39;s seen as an honour to be awarded a fellowship, and these physicians are typically well-respected by residents and attendings.  So, in a nutshell, it&#39;s a significant plus that she had a fellowship dedicated to GRS. It&#39;s honestly the main reason I&#39;m willing to see her after Dr Simonds&#39; disastrous retirement planning for informing his current patients if that intent.
</p>
<p>
My biggest concern is I don&#39;t have the slightest clue how many vaginoplasties one has to perform to be able to safely say they are &#34;experts,&#34; or even if they have done enough, period.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only ever worked with one fellow before and it was an emergency department fellow at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. That guy was someone I&#39;d trust my life with without pause. Just an anecdote for sure, but thought I&#39;d share anyhow just to highlight that fellows are the top-of-the-top-level former residents, and that they don&#39;t chose just anyone to do them.

That’s what I was told by Dr. Simonds himself when we talked on the phone - I didn’t know the difference between a fellowship and residency until now, so I bet he probably did mention it! I appreciate you clearing it up for me and would love to hear about your experience with her.
</p>
<p>
I’ve heard the “expert” numbers quoted on here as being in the hundreds. Still, I’m not a medical expert by any means, and if she’s really put in the work and has the skills then I have no problem with her being a little green.
</p>
<p>
My main things I want to ask her about at my consult are her complication and revision rates, and aesthetics results. Kaiser is the absolute worst about results pics, I had to dig super deep to find anything from Simonds and he’d been doing it forever! If she has pics of her results in-office and you get to take a look at them I’d be super curious to hear what you think.
</p>
<p>
A vibe check would be a huge help thank you so much! It’s been such a clusterfuck - I only heard about Simonds retiring through a social worker I talked to, not sure when in the process I would have been told otherwise!

I&#39;ll be sure to pass on my experience! How did you find Simonds&#39; photos? You&#39;re spot-on with Kaiser and result photos

I managed to find
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/s/nBWlVWSI5o" rel="nofollow">this post</a>
on the sub after some digging, which honestly really impressed me. I know it’s always YMMV, but this post is what gave me confidence that I’d ended up with the right surgeon. Again though, choosing to believe things shook out this way for a reason - hopefully Dr. Li has the goods as well!

Hey! Apologies for not thanking you for that link.
</p>
<p>
I had my consult today and it was amazing!!! Im going to write up a separate post on it in the next day or two, but I wanted to let you know that we are probs lucky to have Dr Simonds retire. Dr Li is really kind, spent a lot of time with me, and her results look incredible.
</p>
<p>
I brought a friend with me to help gauge the vibes and they were also highly impressed with her. So much that they&#39;re going to recommend her their transfemme partner for grs.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to believe that I&#39;m now so close to ✂️✂️ 😂

Hi!  I just wanted to check in if you had any additional thoughts on Dr Li?  What you wrote is certainly promising though!  I&#39;m in the pipeline for hopefully next winter and am assigned to Dr Li.

Heyy! I really like her. I think she really cares about her patients and that matters a lot to me, especially since we are marginalised people that are easily dismissed and face constant ridicule. It&#39;s heartwarming to get that impression from her.  I am definitely moving forward with surgery and feel confident that I will be happy with the results. Can wait to effectively ✂️ that birth defect &#34;off&#34; and move on feeling a sense of bodily integrity.  I&#39;ve been really busy and ADHD&#39;ing myself into a box. I will try to post something about her soon.  Lmk if you have any questions and please pardon the delay in responding.

I am so relieved to be reading this! I just got the phone call yesterday that I have an appointment with her. I&#39;m probably still a year out, as I just started the hair removal process. But trying to find information about her anywhere but here has been rather difficult. Thanks for the info. And I hope your procedure goes really well, or went really well if you&#39;ve already had it!

Ngl in the back of my mind I was pessimistic, this is so great to hear. No worries about the link, looking forward to reading your write up! It sounds like new blood is a good thing after all. Congrats on being so close, excited for you! &lt;3
