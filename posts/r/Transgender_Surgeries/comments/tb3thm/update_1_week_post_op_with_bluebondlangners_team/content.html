I&#39;m pre-op so I have no useful input but, I must say your vulva looks super symmetrical and well defined.

Oh! I‚Äôm so sorry you had to be re-cath‚Äôd. I had to be cath‚Äôd for a urine specimen about a month post-op and I still have nightmares about it.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in your continued healing, sister! It looks like they did fantastic work!

Tyy! While it does feel like a bit of a regression of healing but it should hopefully be out at my first follow up appointment in 4 days.

I&#39;m sorry you had to go back in. I was afraid that I would wind up having to have the catheter reinserted. I was there back in September and I know that you&#39;re in the hands of a good team. Hopefully you&#39;ll be over the hill soon.

Tyy hun! Hopefully it&#39;ll be taken out at my first follow up appointment. What would you consider your over hill moment? Or was it just gradually better and better?

I wouldn&#39;t say I actually started to get over that Hill until I got home at the four week mark. I had some complications with a blood clot on my muscles and tissue on the left side of my labia majora so it delayed it healing properly. It was a real struggle with that one.

It looks great, if that&#39;s any solace. What can I ask were the signs that told you to head to ER?

So when I woke up to pee barely a few drops came out at first I thought It was either anxiety or bloating (two issues I have lol) but after not being able to pee all day and it starting to hurt I called the emergency number and headed into the ER

Just wanted to follow up and say this same thing happened to me lol. I was able to fix myself on the phone with the on call doc by pulling out the tube a cm or so, but then I had to go to the ER a few hours later for a wound vac air leak. The fact that they send us home with that crap just to save a couple bucks on an inpatient stay is ridiculous - prioritizes money over outcomes and it cost us both an expensive ER visit. I&#39;m fine now but will figure out who to write up a nice little complaint to. Hope all is well for you so far

Yikes, that really sucks hun! How long did you stay in the hospital post op? I had some issues with the wound vac too but that was in the hospital so they were able to take care of it no problem (except the loud beeping and grinding noises it made)

Thurs-Sun, then went home with vac+Cath, with the expectation I&#39;d be back Weds to take both out. I guess my belief is that if they&#39;re gonna fail and send me to the ED I might as well just stay in the hospital from Thurs-Weds instead. Then the pros can take care of their equipment.
