<p>
I just got home from Thailand after having surgery with Dr. Theerapong. I went with him through Siam transformative.
</p>
<p>
I did so because of the positive reviews of Siam Transformative and Dr. Theerapong. I&#39;m glad I did because they made it easier to navigate the language barrier, provided rides to and from the doctors office and to the hospital for surgery. They also pick you up from the airport and bring you back when you are ready to leave.
</p>
<p>
Their translator speaks fluent English and Thai which helps a lot. Although Dr. Theerapong speaks english he speaks very softly so it is hard to understand him. The rest of his team only speak Thai so it&#39;s very important to have someone who can help with the language barrier.
</p>
<p>
I chose their extended nursing package which had me having the nurse Cherry coming to see me every day twice a day until they brought me to the airport to go home. Also they bought me food to eat while I was there as I was unable to get food for myself since I went alone. Furthermore the care package includes someone staying with you in the hospital until you leave to go back to the condo apartment that they put you up in. Usually that will cost about 18000 THB equivalent to 500 usd for a month there.
</p>
<p>
If you do end up going there alone and getting the extended care package, it does not cover food costs. You will have to pay them back for what they buy you. However food in Thailand is very cheap and so it doesn&#39;t cost a lot. I ended up paying about 70 dollars USD back to Siam Transformative which comes out to roughly 2500 THB.
</p>
<p>
Siam Transformative sent me home with dilators, extra medications and cleaning supplies to clean myself as I continue to heal.
</p>
<p>
I am including a link to their website for anyone interested in surgery with Dr. Theerapong and going through Siam Transformative.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I am really happy with them and with Dr. Theerapong. I am looking forward to what it will look like when all the swelling goes away and everything is healed.
</p>
<p>
For those who may want to know I had the laprascopic colon vaginoplasty done. I will not be posting any pictures. I am not sure if I will post any or not after the healing is done. However I thought people should know that I had a great experience with them.
</p>
<p>
All in all I highly recommend Siam Transformative. Yes I had to pay a little extra for the care package and food and for the condo apartment that I had to stay in on top of the surgical fee, but honestly it was worth every penny I spent.

I have an issue with the vulva pictured on their site. It totally looks CIS to me not post GRS. not a single scar. I have seen quite a few postop ladies but nothing like that.

Most of the pictures on their site are from girls who are a year or more post op and fully healed.
</p>
<p>
If you want more images from Dr. Theerapong I suggest going to this website I will link now.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://thesexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thesexchange.com/</a>
</p>
<p>
This is where Dr. Theerapong posts many of his post op photos of girls he&#39;s worked on. Some are a year or more healed. Others are within that first month.
</p>
<p>
Also I have been told that most girls use coconut oil on their scars once everything has settled down on their scars to reduce evidence of the scar itself.
</p>
<p>
Below is a link to his website. He doesn&#39;t post any of the post-op results on there as he posts them to the website linked above.

No this isn&#39;t an advertisement. I&#39;m autistic so I wrote honestly and also wanted to give them a shout out to help as Siam Transformative is a 3 person team.
</p>
<p>
There is the Translator Becky an american transplant whom married a Thai national who is 60 years old and on disability.
</p>
<p>
There is Meredith their website and marketing person whom is the first point of contact with all trans girls. She herself is trans.
</p>
<p>
Then there is Cherry the nurse. It&#39;s a small business and team that are very caring and helpful.
</p>
<p>
You can think it&#39;s an ad and I won&#39;t blame you. I hope you find the surgeon and team for you.

To anyone still looking at this post. I had edited it to have a new web address for Siam Transformation formerly Siam Transformative. They rebranded and now have a new website which I linked in the original post above. I will also link here in my post as well.

Even if it is an ad I’ve heard the same things from people who have actually gone with them so it’s not exaggerating much if anything

I understand if you think this is an ad.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m autistic so I don&#39;t really know how to write a review that sounds and reads as authentic. I apologize.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want anyone who thinks that what I wrote is an ad to feel that they have to go to Dr. Theerapong or Siam Transformative for their surgery.
</p>
<p>
I just thought posting a review of my time in Thailand with Dr. Theerapong and Siam Transformative would help other girls decide if they wanted to go with Dr. Theerapong and have an option for an english speaking team to help them with their time there.

I know I felt taken care of by their team as well.
</p>
<p>
Becky was able to help me navigate the language barrier and communicate with Dr. Theerapong easier.
</p>
<p>
Cherry was a delight and we got to talking about my diet, lifestyle and even her problems with getting her husband allowed into Thailand as a resident.

Definitely not an ad. I did very thorough research and couldn&#39;t find a single case of them advertising anywhere (in fact I almost didn&#39;t find out about them due to a lack of advertising).
</p>
<p>
I leave tomorrow and have seen how busy they&#39;ve been these past 30 days. They&#39;ve gotten here entirely through word of mouth and I doubt business for them is going to slow down.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen the same thing happen to my endocrinologist and my electrolysis technician. If you provide quality service to the trans community and are genuinely respectful and caring towards the community? Your business will explode.
</p>
<p>
This would be the third time I&#39;ve seen this phenomenon happen.

Dr. Theerapong doesn&#39;t advertise outside of Thailand but girls outside of Thailand are starting to go to him. He doesn&#39;t want to come off like Kamol and his team.
</p>
<p>
Siam Transformative is trying to advertise their services, but they don&#39;t want people to think that they are like Kamol as well. Instead they want girls who&#39;ve used their services to spread the word through places on here and other sites like Facebook and other social media platforms for them.
</p>
<p>
I posted my review because they deserve it and so that they can help more girls. That is Siam Transformative&#39;s goal, to help girls. Yes they need to make money to provide the services that they provide, but I was told directly from Becky and Cherry the two whom any girls will meet if they go through Siam when they get to Thailand, that they do this to help international girls.
</p>
<p>
Also it is Cherry&#39;s dream and goal to open a healing center for Siam Transformative one day for girls who come to Thailand and use Dr. Theerapong as their surgeon.

Very true. It&#39;s also why I left my review (and just to be clear I had not been asked by Siam to leave the review. They may have when I left, but I pre-empted it by telling them I&#39;d be giving them a review.

I&#39;m autistic as I explained to another person on here. I posted the review because they deserve it. Not everything was perfect, but they took care of me and I want to help girls find a good surgeon and also find a team that speaks english so that they don&#39;t have a problem with the language barrier.
</p>
<p>
Sure people can go to the Suporn Clinic or to Dr. Chettawut as they have a fully english speaking team. However both doctors are quick to fill their schedule as I have seen first hand when trying to schedule with them.
</p>
<p>
There are other Doctors too like the PAI hospital which probably has english speaking staff.
</p>
<p>
Just remember most Thai people speak softly when speaking another language. While I was there when they spoke their native Thai it seemed quite loud. However when they spoke english it was quite soft and hard to understand.
