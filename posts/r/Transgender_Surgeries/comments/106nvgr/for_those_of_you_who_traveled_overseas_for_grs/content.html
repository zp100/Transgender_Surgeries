I&#39;m considering just saving my money to go overseas for surgery. I love the work Bluebond-Langner does, but her waiting list is terrible. Min Jun isn&#39;t covered by my insurance, and his waiting list is also terrible. I don&#39;t know that I want to wait 5-6 years.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been seeing work from artists like Bank, and I&#39;m wondering if pursuing GRS outside the US is a better option.
</p>
<p>
Would you care to share your experience?
</p>
<p>
How did recovery work? Did you have to rent somewhere locally? Did you have to fly back there for follow-ups, did you fly there for a consultation? How did you get meds for pain? Were the instructions good? Was there a big language barrier (both inside and outside the hospital)? What was the cost (total) like? What was the bedside manner like? How was the culture where you went, were they accepting or did you have to sort of hide? Did you get help from someone local to the area? How did you set everything up? What were your results like? Did you have complications - and if so, how were they handled?
</p>
<p>
Penny for your thoughts. Anything you care to share would be wonderful, thanks in advance.

My friend went to Suporn and I went with her.
</p>
<p>
They have a hotel they use, they drop you off and you pay for the month. It’s cheap.
</p>
<p>
Your consult is done the day before or a couple of days before surgery.
</p>
<p>
They supply you with meds.
</p>
<p>
The instructions are good.
</p>
<p>
The language barrier is hard in the hospital, I’m glad I stayed in the hospital with her. They gave me a bed and I stayed the week caring for her.
</p>
<p>
She paid less than $20k, I think it’s under $25k now.
</p>
<p>
Bedside manners weren’t great from the hospital staff, I think they were annoyed with me. They kept moving her call button so she couldn’t reach it.
</p>
<p>
Setup is done through the office person.
</p>
<p>
Her results are phenomenal.
</p>
<p>
Complications are handled at the hospital when you’re in Thailand. She was bitten by a snake while there and that treatment was free.
</p>
<p>
The results are amazing, far better than I’ve seen in the US. I’m cis but I’m an electrologist who works with the trans community so this is my passion. I would go to Dr Bank and no one else.

I never heard of that before. It’s usually dogs and monkeys (and rabies) people worry about, although I’ve not heard of anyone bitten by those either.

I had never heard of it either. It thankfully was venomous but it closely resembled a green viper.

She was bitten by a little green snake waking down a street. It was really nice of the clinic to help her and take care of everything. They really do go the extra mile for their patients.

Thank you! I fronted the cost of surgery (she paid me back) and flew with her, I didn’t plan on staying but she needed it. She’s my best friend, I know she would do it for me if the roles were reversed. I love the community and I’m happy to be able to help. I’m bi and I feel much more accepted by the trans community than the gay community.

Thank you for the info, I’m in the middle of trying to figure out my surgery options and this was really helpful.

highly, highly recommend Dr Bank at the Suporn clinic.  that said, they are booked out for all of 2023.
</p>
<p>
Suporn clinic has the best results i have seen. i&#39;m biased, of course, as i am 7 months post op, but my vag is nice, and looks 100% cis. and everything works great!

Hey I’m looking into surgery options for myself in 2024 and I was wondering how the booking process actually works for the Suporn clinic, would you mind messaging me about it?

I will say for dr jun it’s much worse looking than it really is. If you get your psych/doc letters and tell them you are working on hair removal you can pumped up considerably. Have a consult in a few months and surgery 6-8 months after that you have your shit together. I know of that happening with several people. If you have any questions about it let me know. Source: I’m 11 weeks post op with dr jun

Context: I had SRS with Dr Chettawut in Bangkok Thailand in 2008.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How did recovery work?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first day or two was spent in the hospital. Not much going on, just lying around. I think after two days they removed the packing and maybe some stitches, and I was sent by car to the recovery hotel.
</p>
<p>
Nurses would come by on a regular basis, and I stayed there for a little over 2 weeks I think. Physically, my recovery was very easy, pretty much no pain.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Did you have to rent somewhere locally?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In terms of finding arrangements, no - at least back then all of his patients stayed at a nearby hotel.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Did you have to fly back there for follow-ups, did you fly there for a consultation?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nope, just a single trip - arrived, consultation, surgery, recovery, then flight back home.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How did you get meds for pain?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They were just given to me. Tramadol, which I think I just took for a few days.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Were the instructions good?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Re: medication, or overall? Either way yes, everything felt pretty clear, I was able to do whatever they needed me to do and nothing went wrong.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Was there a big language barrier (both inside and outside the hospital)?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Fairly big - I&#39;m not sure if anyone I spoke to there was fully fluent, but everyone I needed to communicate with was able to communicate anything important. I didn&#39;t really go out into the city at all, though.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What was the cost (total) like?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hard to remember specifics, but I remember the number $10000 (USD) - I think that was for SRS, and then another $1000 or so for thyroid cartilage reduction. Hotel stay was probably extra, but I can&#39;t remember.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What was the bedside manner like?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He was friendly - I got the sense his English was minimal, but maybe he was just quiet? I had a very easy recovery, so my needs were minimal and I didn&#39;t really have a need for bedside manner... Very minimal interactions.
</p>
<p>
As for the hospital and nurses, no complaints. Everyone was nice and respectful. Everything was smooth.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How was the culture where you went, were they accepting or did you have to sort of hide?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn&#39;t go out much, but I didn&#39;t observe any hostility. In general I think trans people are less rare in Bangkok than many places, both in terms of locals and medical tourists like me.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Did you get help from someone local to the area?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He had drivers take me wherever I needed to go, and nurses to come by to the hotel on a regular basis, but not other than that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How did you set everything up?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hard to remember. I emailed him in 2007 with what I wanted, I was told what documents I needed and how to wire him the money, and.. that was pretty much it until I flew there (in 2008) I think.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What were your results like?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think they were good, no complaints. You can actually see my post history for recent pictures if curious.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Did you have complications - and if so, how were they handled?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, apart from minor issues like granulation which were handled at doctor&#39;s visits back home in New York.
