Dr DeLeon will be my surgeon.  I&#39;m super excited/scared/ready/frightened about this.   I&#39;m over 40, my wife has been very supportive as I&#39;ve moved to the real me.  This was supposed to have happened in July, but that pandemic crap wrecked schedules.   Getting 8 weeks FMLA, yee all it took for 2months paid time off was a sex change!  Don&#39;t see that catching on at work however.

I just had penile inversion Vaginoplasty with Dr DeLeon August 5th! I was part of their trial for our patient surgical experience. I had my surgery and recovered in PACU for a few hours (Westlake Medical Cneter). I then went to my hotel with my friend. My recovery went smooth aside from the typical pain. I stayed in the area for 2 weeks after surgery and then flew back to NC. I have to say I was beyond pleased with my results! I have had some minor wound separation but they have been so helpful talking me through it. I also agree, Teresa is wonderful!  Best of luck!

Interesting.  Since I live in San Antonio, thanks to the mess that is I-35 the drive is about 2.5 hours from my home, I wonder if they&#39;ll let me leave sooner?  That would be nice and save me $$.  I got a nice room on Town Lake for the night before, I&#39;ve driven by that hotel a hundred times always wanted to stay there.
</p>
<p>
Hmm I&#39;ll have to chat with them about this.

I had surgery with her last August and live in SA. You’ll likely still need to stay in Austin for the first week but once they remove the packing you can come home and you’ll just have to visit for post op appts. That said, you’ll deff need someone to drive you back and forth to the first few post op appts since youll still be really sore.

Oh aces.  I&#39;m doing the full so I&#39;m betting my time in hospital will be longer.  I&#39;ve read nothing but good about them, but I&#39;d prefer to hear from someone who writes/speaks back as it were then an online &#34;Oh this doc was great...&#34;
<br>
How long were you are the hospital?

Good point.  I considered it, but decided in for a penny, in for a pound.
