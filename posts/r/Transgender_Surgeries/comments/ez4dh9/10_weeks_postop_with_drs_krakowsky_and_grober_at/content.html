It&#39;s been a while since my previous update at the three week mark (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e6jqjg/vaginoplasty_with_dr_krakowsky_and_dr_grober_at/">Index post with other updates.</a>
), and I&#39;m now just over 10 weeks post-op. In the meanwhile, quite a bit has happened, some good, but mostly not:
</p>
<p>
Dr. Krakowsky was able to trim a significant portion of the sloughed skin at the 3 week follow-up so it wouldn&#39;t poke out again... A week later, I started to really shed sutures, and the rest of the skin poked out, but this time it wasn&#39;t anchored and came out with a gentle tug. I&#39;m glad that&#39;s done with.
</p>
<p>
Lots of sutures have come out! There&#39;s still one annoyingly stubborn one on my right majora incision line, but other than that I think I&#39;m pretty much done with the external sutures. This mostly happened in December / early January. Yay!
</p>
<p>
One major downside of the sutures coming out is that I&#39;ve lost my clitoral hood. I don&#39;t know exactly why, but I had some sutures holding the two halves of my hood together. I had mentioned to Dr. Krakowsky at the 3 week follow-up that it looked like there was a hole in my hood, he was confident that it should re-epithelialize. Sadly that was not the case. I discovered at the 5 week mark that the suture holding the two halves had given up, and instead of a hood covering my clitoris, I now have my minora extending up past my clitoris by about 1cm. My clitoris is now even more prominent and exposed. There was no blood, and it looked like the two sides healed to themselves as opposed to each other.
</p>
<p>
I had a follow up at the 6 week mark (start of January), Other than the split hood, I&#39;m apparently healing quite well, and I was cleared to resume physical activity and to start lifting more than 15 lbs again. I raised some of my concerns (split hood, prominent clitoris, 1 of my majora basically being flat), and got a &#34;wait and see&#34; response, which I suppose makes sense at 1.5 months post-op, but I&#39;ve got the feeling that I&#39;ll be looking at a revision unless a miracle happens. They also suggested that I try going without pads to see if that helped reduce the irritation. I had a session with the physiotherapist as well, she got me started on some stretches to help loosen up my hips again. One major highlight of the day was that I got to hold my daughter again that evening! :D
</p>
<p>
It turned out as well that some of the difficulty I was having with dilation last update was due to a yeast infection. (Yay! My first vaginal yeast infection! /s) Emery noticed it during my follow-up and prescribed Canasten. It worked well, and the friction I was feeling getting the dilator in and back out is gone. I don&#39;t need any extra lube at this point, just lubing up the dilators has been enough since dealing with the yeast.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also moved up to #4. I started trying it out just before the 6 week follow-up, and it felt like I was running into a wall. After a few days of trying it once a day, I was able to get it in, but it was hellish getting it out with the friction from the yeast. After finishing dealing with the yeast, it got a lot easier, and at this point I&#39;m routinely starting with #2 to relax the muscles, then moving up to #3 followed by #4 and spending my time at depth with #4.
</p>
<p>
I tried to re-start on the elliptical, as well and found that my clitoris was too exposed without the hood to be at all comfortable, basically felt like I was being jabbed in the clitoris with every stride. I also started wearing pads again to try to protect it, which sort of helped when they weren&#39;t busily ramming into my clit. FML. (I suspect that if a) my clit weren&#39;t quite as prominent, b) my hood hadn&#39;t split, or c) I had 2 functional majora, it wouldn&#39;t be as bad. As it is, I had a brief moment of elation that I was allowed to exercise again, followed by frustration that I can&#39;t do it because OW. I stopped wearing pads briefly after dealing with the yeast, it kind of helped with the sensation on my clitoris just existing, but didn&#39;t do anything for working out. Out of frustration I tried using a small strip of medical tape to bridge the two sides of my minora together around my clitoris, and that&#39;s helped a LOT. I&#39;m able to elliptical and run again, and just moving around isn&#39;t tugging on my clitoris either.
</p>
<p>
At the 8 week mark I was allowed to start exploring, and while I can safely say that I can orgasm, it isn&#39;t easy or without pain. Gentle touch feels nice on my minora and majora, though my clitoris still felt pretty numb at the 8 week mark. The first time I tried, I found that my small wand vibrator (not a magic wand, much smaller and only runs on a pair of AA batteries, so not very powerful) felt pretty good just above my clit, and I discovered that I do self-lube on arousal, enough at least to get my vestibule pretty wet, and to finger myself, though I couldn&#39;t really find much pleasure inside with my finger, the vibrator also felt nice. I wasn&#39;t able to orgasm, but I was pretty happy that I was starting to feel some pleasure. The second time I tried, I also used my fancy remote vibrator which was designed for prostate/perineum play (2 vibrators in one, controlled via bluetooth with my phone). Much more powerful than my small wand, and I was able to get a lot more pleasure out of it. I almost thought I wasn&#39;t going to orgasm, but when I accepted that and stopped chasing it mentally, it hit me. 2 words, holy fuck. It was a mix of pleasure and some pain from around my clitoris, but I very definitely came. Then I came again, more pain in the mix this time, but also more intense and full-body. I felt incredibly drained afterwards, and haven&#39;t really wanted to try anything else since then beyond gentle touching to see how things feel (answer 2 weeks later, less irritated but in wait mode because of other &#34;fun&#34;.)
</p>
<p>
I also started to get a lot more vaginal discharge (watery and whitish), and a building fishy aroma over the next week. I&#39;d had a decent amount of watery discharge since a few weeks post-op and I finished the initial prescription of nidagel, so I didn&#39;t really think much of the discharge until the fishy smell started to hit. I thought I&#39;d cleaned my toys and hands pretty well before using them, but something definitely upset the applecart, either toy cleanliness, penetration &amp; orgasm, or changing floral balance by dealing with the yeast.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve officially had my first post-op UTI, I didn&#39;t notice it underneath the yeast infection, so I lived with it for a couple of weeks until the yeast was done and I noticed that peeing was still painful. My family Dr. showed a great deal of foresight when I saw her while dealing with the yeast since she gave me a lab req for a urine sample in the event that some of the irritation I was feeling turned out to be a UTI. I did the urine sample, and then scheduled an appointment to discuss. I also mentioned that things were starting to smell fishy and I was getting more discharge, and my Dr took a vaginal swab at the same time as prescribing antibiotics for the UTI. The swab freaking hurt, I&#39;d been noticing that the anterior wall of my vagina had been feeling tender and sensitive when inserting the #2 dilator, but I didn&#39;t realize how sensitive it was. I felt it in my urethra, probably sensitized by the UTI. She also gave my a prescription for a combined vaginal antibiotic/fungicide to hold pending the lab results.
</p>
<p>
While waiting for the lab results, the antibiotics have taken care of the UTI, and I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m drinking more fluids again (go figure, when it hurt to pee, I didn&#39;t want to drink.). According to the lab results, I&#39;ve got &#34;atypical flora&#34;, as opposed to full blown bacterial vaginosis. But it still smells bad (though not as bad as before treating the UTI), and I&#39;m still getting a fair amount of watery discharge (again, not as much as before dealing with the UTI.) My Dr. recommended giving the vaginal antibiotic a go. I&#39;ll also be following it up with a vaginal probiotic after it&#39;s done based on discussion with my pharmacist, and a pH balancer based on my own reading and gut feeling. I&#39;m hoping that I can eventually get to a balanced and healthy flora, and perhaps even get a baseline of &#34;not fucked up&#34; for once.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not ready to try playing with myself again until after the antibiotics have a chance to do their thing and I can get the probiotics into me. This probably means no real playing around on V-day, sadly, but my sex drive is pretty low, so *shrug*. I can make some nice romantic plans.
</p>
<p>
One oddity I&#39;ve noticed over the last week is that the entrance to my vagina seems to be off-center now. It feels like there&#39;s something firm on one side pushing the dilator over to the other. It either wasn&#39;t there earlier, or I had it roughly evenly on both sides so I didn&#39;t notice it. I&#39;ll mention it at my next follow up to be safe.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, I&#39;ve got another follow-up with Dr. Krakowsky next week, which should be pretty straight forward with no new complications to discuss. I hope. I&#39;ve been feeling pretty tired and worn out the last few weeks, and I&#39;m hoping I bounce back by the time I&#39;m due to go back to work. I&#39;m also trying to get back on the horse with activity and diet, my goal is to be down to my goal weight before swimsuit weather, and maybe have a bikini body even.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve found that post-op I tend to jump upward in weight and generally feel somewhat shitty and low energy and bloaty. After FFS I went from 138 to 147 and felt pretty crappy for about 4-5 weeks. After VFS I went from 145 to 152 and felt pretty crappy for about 3-4 weeks. After bottom surgery, I was 147 immediately post-op. I hit 152 over the holidays but I&#39;m back down to 148 now, which is better than I&#39;ve managed with either of my other surgeries, and I&#39;m starting to feel more like I&#39;ve got some real energy and the need to be active, though it comes and goes still.
</p>
<p>
I really want to take off the 10 lbs that I&#39;ve put on since FFS. I&#39;d almost taken off all of my belly fat at that weight, something that&#39;s bugged me since I was a teen and started seeking comfort in food. I&#39;m kind of curious what my ideal weight will end up being, I&#39;ve never really felt happy about my body since puberty, so I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m able to find out what not having a bit of pudge feels like this year.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I&#39;m still glad I no longer have a penis, but I&#39;m very much in a state of frustration with my vulva and vagina. Mainly my vulva to be honest, I had high hopes, and the asymmetry and split hood have definitely gotten to me. I don&#39;t regret bottom surgery, but I am hoping that I didn&#39;t sacrifice ultimate outcome on the altar of expediency.

It&#39;s a lot of relativity minor stuff all stacked together. Dealing with all of it sucks, admittedly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very glad I&#39;m not having any real problems getting to depth during dilation, for example (I&#39;m usually around 3 minutes to prep and get #2 to depth, I&#39;m going to try starting with #3 soon to save some time, of my PC muscles are willing to cooperate.)
</p>
<p>
I also only had minor wound separation, and no necrosis or other major complications either.

Thank you for documenting your experience! I&#39;m booked at WCH for 2 weeks from now and found this to be super helpful! Hope your recovery is going well! &lt;3

You&#39;re welcome, I&#39;m glad my experiences have helped. I hope everything goes smoothly for you! Please feel free to ask me anything if you want.

For the most part it&#39;s going pretty well, I&#39;ve got more energy now than when I wrote this update, but I&#39;ve had another round of &#34;atypical flora&#34;, some unexplained vaginal bleeding, and dilation is acutely painful in the last ~1cm of depth.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m down in Toronto again this Thursday for another follow up and I&#39;m crossing my fingers they can figure out what&#39;s going on. I should probably do a 16 week update once I know more.

Thank you for all of these. I&#39;ve been reading over each thread and have been really appreciating it all. WCH is new, and with covid there already small intake kind of stopped. I&#39;ve only seen your posts in relation to them and so thank you for sharing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m debating between full or no depth, and with these threads talking about the good and bad, its really helping.
</p>
<p>
I hope things start getting better in terms of looks, or that there are some options that are available.
</p>
<p>
I did have one question, was there a charge for ARC? Or was that covered through ohip/insurance? Just wondering as I don&#39;t live in Toronto, about an hour or so away and so I&#39;m not sure if I would be able to go home after 3 days.

There&#39;s less inflammation, but I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s been a significant cosmetic improvement. My 6 month got pushed due to COVID, and that&#39;s when we were going to start talking about revision in detail. I&#39;ve also reached out to Dr Wittenberg for at least a second opinion.
</p>
<p>
ARC was completely covered by OHIP, so I had minimal out of pocket expenses while in Toronto. No idea if it would be an option for you or not since you&#39;re much closer to Toronto than I am. They want you in clinic at 7 days and ~14 days post op, so you&#39;d be looking at a fair bit of travel if you were to try to go home early. The trip from WCH to ARC was bad enough for me, so I would definitely go for ARC if it&#39;s an option.

Thanks for the reply. Definitely sounds like I need to try and get arrangements with ARC if its at all possible. Maybe by the time I have it done they&#39;ll have a more permanent place for patients recovering.
</p>
<p>
Either way, 1.5 drive there and back at 7 and 14 days doesn&#39;t sound enjoyable at all. The 1.5 hour drive home after day 3 doesn&#39;t sound enjoyable :
</p>
<p>
Really hope things look up in recovery. Some times it can take a year, but also a second opinion at 6mo is definitely worth it if you can manage it I think.

Given their current tempo, ARC seems to be a viable option for the time being, but who knows what the future will bring.
</p>
<p>
Unless you&#39;re lying almost flat with the good painkillers? Probably not terribly enjoyable, no.
</p>
<p>
I know it can take a year for everything to settle, but I&#39;m not exactly hopeful given the issues. I&#39;ve actually got the consult with Dr. Wittenberg scheduled for next week, so it is very definitely happening. :) (She will work with OHIP by the way, if you&#39;re looking for another option besides GRS Montreal.)
