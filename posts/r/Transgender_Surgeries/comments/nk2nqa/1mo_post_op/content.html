1 month post op with Dr. mcginn. Everything is healing well. There is still a fair amount of swelling, especially in my labia causing it to look a little uneven. I expect it to even out over time. Also the sutures should clear up a bit. After a month or so, I am back at almost full movement, feel great and have had no complications. I’m very happy with the outcome. Feel free to ask me anything. I may delete this in a day or so.

Hi, thanks! I didn&#39;t stay at the Gaia House, but would recommend it based on what I&#39;ve heard. For me, me and my surgery buddy wanted extra space so we rented a house in the area, which worked great for us. The communication with Papillon Center is very good. They helped coordinate with insurance, answered many questions via email and were very supportive throughout the process. Dr. McGinn did ask what I was looking for, but I didn&#39;t have strong preferences. Mainly I asked her to spare depth over aesthetic since I&#39;m lesbian and depth isn&#39;t super important to me. I still ended up with 5.25 inches, which is plenty for me :D

<p>
When did she ask about aesthetics?  I&#39;ve had my consultation and my operation is scheduled in just a couple months, and that hasn&#39;t come up yet.  Did you have to bring up that topic?  Or did she?

I don&#39;t remember exactly how it came up. I think I may have mentioned that I was considering shallow depth at one point but decided I&#39;d prefer to have full depth, but that depth wasn&#39;t the most important thing to me. I don&#39;t know if she was looking to tailor the result to my preferences or just make sure I had realistic expectations of the outcome. Either way, I think she&#39;ll take whatever you have and  turn it into the best result possible.

Oh I have no doubt.  A part of me is thinking just don&#39;t bring it up.  She knows what she&#39;s doing, she takes a ton of pride in her work, and I feel like letting her do her thing is the best path.
</p>
<p>
Actually now that I think about it, I vaguely remember her commenting on size (I am, regrettably, not well endowed...) and then asking about if that would affect the results.  She said the only material she struggles with to get good awsthetics are small, skinny girls who are well endowed, so if I understand correctly having too much material for your size is the only struggle.

Please keep in mind that I am not a doctor, not a plastic surgeon, and especially not a plastic surgeon who uses Dr. McGinn&#39;s penile inversion technique.  I&#39;m a geologist, so I&#39;m not exactly speaking to my expertise here and you should take everything I say with the Paradox Basin&#39;s volume of salt.
</p>
<p>
If I understand her correctly, the difficulty is in maintaining both sensation and aesthetics.  The nerves, which in the legacy system traveled the length of the shaft, need to be repositioned in a way that maintains sensation, but doing so requires that material to be kept around.  If an individual has a small stature, but a lot to work with in creating the neo-vagine, what results is an appearance that could be described as &#34;loose&#34;.
</p>
<p>
But again keep in mind that I am not a doctor, not a plastic surgeon, and honestly kind of stupid.  Aesthetics is something you&#39;ll need to discuss with your surgeon.

Have you gotten any feedback from lesbian partners about the taste or smell with the PI result?.. I’m concerned about this.

Wow! For one month that looks beautiful. Thanks for sharing as this gives so much of us hope for those who are waiting for their time.
</p>
<p>
I do have to ask as I really don’t see this very much from other posters but were you at all like, OMG I finally have a vagina!
</p>
<p>
I personally can’t wait for that day and my future first post will be me just throwing a whole lot of wonderful exciting words as I still can’t believe it is possible to look so good down there.
</p>
<p>
Like, I get just so excited for all of you girls to finally have that part of them healed. It’s so exciting! In my heart will be full of butterflies for days, weeks and years afterwards just looking down there and seeing what I’ve always dreamed of seeing.
</p>

Thanks, I really appreciate it  :). There were definitely many OMG moments... when I woke up in the hospital, getting the packaging out and seeing it for the first time and seeing it, wearing underpants and not worrying about tucking for the first time.... and now that it feels &#39;normal&#39; I&#39;m like OMG all the time. It&#39;s so amazing, I love it! Hope your day comes soon too!!

I look forward to that day! It is going to be just such a beautiful experience even given the anxiety and fears about it. I rejected surgery for most of my life hoping and praying that miracle or magic would somehow happen. Somehow I convinced myself for 45 years… Somehow would be possible or that I could remain hidden for so long. I am so glad my shell broke seven or so weeks ago and now such things are so desired!!
</p>
<p>
That excitement and joy overrides that fear any day. And seeing images like this and just the beautiful work that the medical community can do now brings me so much excitement. Thank you again for being vulnerable and showing such intimate pictures, it makes a world of difference for ladies like me require such changes in their future.

Congratulations❣️ Thank you for sharing. Based on previous proven results for Dr. McGinn patients, I’m betting you will continue to heal just fine.

Thank you!!! I really appreciate the compliment. Going into it, I wanted to preserve as much hair as possible (I&#39;m old school about it I guess). I did 3 full &#39;brazilian&#39; style laser sessions which cleared up a lot of hair. I also did 5 full electrolysis sessions (3+hrs each), focusing on the critical areas (I had it done at Papillon). I was definitely on the lower end of the hair removal spectrum in comparison to other girls. I definitely made sure that there wouldn&#39;t be anything inside... you picked up on what I was trying for on the outside! :D

Thank you!! Hard work is such a correct way to put it. It&#39;s hard to imagine all the hoops you have to jump through when you first start planning out GCS. It&#39;s like having a second job. Looking back at it, I am really proud of what I&#39;ve accomplished and so happy :)

Thanks! I know PPT and Colon seem to be what people want right now. From my perspective, I was happy with PI for a few reasons
</p>
<p>
- the surgery is substantially shorter, which makes it lower risk and the recovery period is quicker
</p>
<p>
- the procedure is widely used and has been for a very long time.
</p>
<p>
- With Dr. McGinn&#39;s techniques, I was confident that I would be happy with the external appearance. Internally, I can say that it &#39;feels real&#39; and I&#39;m happy with the depth and sensation inside so far.

Hi, I have a couple of questions (To be honest there are a lot of questions): How was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors (It&#39;s on my short list and I have doubts who to go with)? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos (is one of the best results than i ver seen of Dr. Christine McGinn)? And if you opt for revision surgery or medical tattooing, What elements of your vulva would you like to improve?, How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Hi! Happy to answer your questions.
</p>
<p>
- So far my recovery has gone really well. As I mentioned, I didn&#39;t have any complications, so was on schedule for all the milestones at the hospital and early recovery (i.e. able to walk and pee with no problems, etc.). Since I got home, I&#39;ve been more active than expected. It wasn&#39;t too bad getting around the house and going for walks, I just got more tired than usual. Overall, I feel great now considering everything.
</p>
<p>
- I would highly recommend Dr. McGinn!! I chose her because I&#39;ve had a number of friends have surgery with her and all were happy. Also, her being trans was really a plus for me (if you haven&#39;t already, watch the movie &#39;Trans&#39; and you can learn more about her). She does about 150 GCS per year, which I thought was a good number and has a very low complication rate. I was most worried about the risk of fistula and she gave me a lot of comfort over that risk in particular during my consult.
</p>
<p>
- At one month, I think things look and feel great, but I have a long ways to go. The area is still very swollen from surgery and will look much different in a few months. I&#39;m hoping things even out (one side is noticeably more swollen than the other) and am interested to see how the sutures heal up. Sensitivity-wise, the nerves are still &#39;waking up&#39; in some areas but it&#39;s getting more and more sensate. I haven&#39;t really tried to orgasm yet. I can feel things coming back to life down there, but I&#39;m not physically or mentally ready to go there yet.
</p>
<p>
- I don&#39;t plan any revisions or cosmetic touch ups right now. My goal was to come out happy, healthy and functional. So far I&#39;ve hit that goal. While the surgery and recovery has gone well... right now I have no desire for more procedures. GCS is hard! That may change in a few months, but unless there&#39;s something needed functionally, I think I&#39;m going to count my blessings for what I have and be happy with it.
</p>
<p>
- The New Hope area is lovely! I went to Papillon for my hair removal and was able to spend a fair amount of time in the area. I would go there for a family vacation! I didn&#39;t stay at Gaia. Mainly we didn&#39;t stay there because my surgery buddy and I wanted a space with more privacy, so we rented a house in New Jersey. The house was about 40 minutes away from the hospital and Papillon, which is more than they recommend. The car ride was a little uncomfortable, but not bad. We flew home on Friday and getting through the airport, sitting on the plane and the car ride home was probably the most pain / discomfort I was in throughout the entire ordeal! Just being up and moving for so long was painful and tiring.
</p>
<p>
- The staff at Papillon are very kind and helpful. It&#39;s a relatively small business, so you really get to know the staff. For something so significant and personal, I really appreciated knowing who to ask certain questions to and also knowing that the person I&#39;m talking to knows a lot about me and how to help. I&#39;ve seen some complaints that you don&#39;t see Dr. McGinn much. That was definitely the case for me. I saw her for a few minutes in the pre-op room, she stopped by after surgery to check on me and she was at my post-op appointment and checked on me. Her staff provide most of your care. I had no issues with this as they&#39;re a small team and have literally done hundreds of GCS together and are experts at it.
</p>
<p>
Whew, I think I got em all! Let me know if you have any other questions. Happy to help! This forum really helped me ease my concerns and know what to expect, so happy to pay it forward :D

Hi! I’m still getting my sensation back overall. Externally, I have a little on my labia, but still has a ways to go. My clitoris is very sensate and I’ve been able to orgasm, but it was just a mini-gasm. It’s sometimes uncomfortable how sensitive that part is! But it gets better. Internally, it’s similar... have just a bit of sensation, but getting more. I can feel pressure from my dilators. On the smaller ones it feels nice. The larger one is still a little ouchy. One month out, it’s really hard to tell.
