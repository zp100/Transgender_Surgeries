33 years old, penile inversion. I specifically asked her for smaller labia majora. If you visit her site, and don&#39;t like her example photos, don&#39;t rule her out just yet. She has tons more photos that you can ask to see during consultation. She doesn&#39;t like putting just the ideal results up online.
</p>
<p>
This will probably be my last post. Though I might do one more at 1 year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with how things turned out. There are certainly things I&#39;m not 100% satisfied with (like the lack of distinct labia minora), but there&#39;s always the option for revision.
</p>
<p>
At the follow-up, the speculum was definitely an interesting experience. She seemed confident that everything looked quite good/natal: a healthy pink lining, a bit of self-lubrication, no granulation.
</p>
<p>
Still have yet to try getting off by penetration, but rubbing and vibrators (especially a magic wand) are gold right now.

Why did you decide to go for PI over PPT, especially with Dr. Wittenberg?

She explained that there still isn&#39;t much long-term data on PPT as opposed to PI, so she recommends PPT as a backup option should there be complications with the PI operation.
</p>
<p>
I kinda assumed based on that that should I ever need/want more self-lubrication and/or more depth (than 5.5-6&#34;), I should be able to get a revision using PPT to extend my vaginal canal. Maybe that&#39;s something I should have confirmed with her first. üòÖ

Maybe.  There seem to be a couple surgeons who do PPT as a revision only, and a couple others who do a hybrid, which almost sounds like doing the PPT revision at the same time as the PI surgery.  How is your lubrication?

It&#39;s not quite enough to be entirely self-sufficient. I have to use a bit of lube to get my dilator in, but once it&#39;s in, my natural lubrication seems just fine.

I just had mine a month ago and I was like ‚Äúmore labia sounds great!‚Äù Now....im beginning to regret that since they are very much in the way. Still, Dr W is just amazing!

Your minora look great so far! And your majora don&#39;t look overly large either. Pretty great IMO. üòã
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious to see how yours heals up as mine looked pretty similar at first, but they (the minora) are nowhere to be seen now.

Im hoping the minora shrink a little bit more and soften up a bunch. My pee stream is fine but the labia keep extra in and im always dripping afterwards. On a related note when do I stop dripping strange liquids for the most part? Its like a swamp down there

That is a great question to which I unfortunately don&#39;t have an answer. I bought super heavy liners expecting lots of discharge, but I never really had anything near what I&#39;ve heard others describe. I switched to super lightweight liners as soon as I&#39;d gone through the others that I bought. I continued wearing those &#34;just in case&#34; through about two months at which point I pawned those off on my partner. üòÇ
</p>
<p>
You don&#39;t separate your labia when you wipe to let the rest out? I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s what any woman with labia like your would have to do.

Lol i haven‚Äôt really needed the heavy pads beyond just wearing them so they arent wasted. I think they collect sweat more than anything else! The majority of what im leaking these days is that yellowish brownish healing goop.
</p>
<p>
As for the spreading. Im doing that but there is definitely a method to get it all out and I havent nailed it all. Plus having to do that damned hydrogen peroxide spray isnt helping the situation!!!!

Lol! I forgot about that. The spray definitely tried to drip all everywhere, and it was usually a race to stop it.
</p>
<p>
Are you leaning forward a bit? I feel like I sometimes get a bit of pee going back into my vaginal canal if I&#39;m sitting upright. Not sure how true that is though. üòÖ

Your normal. CiS women do not climax during penetration. But there is one huge down fall with me is when rubbing is used it takes me an average of 3 hours tops. With a vibrator that has automatic very speed it takes me 30 minutes to 1 hour with multiples climaxing. Its very intense so I try to shy away using a vibrator. Only time I perform any is during dilation and thats once a month.
