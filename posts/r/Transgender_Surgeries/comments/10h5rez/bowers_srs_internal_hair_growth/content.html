Hi all,
</p>
<p>
I feel like I should post here because this is something I wish I had fully understood before I got surgery with Dr. Bowers. I ended up in a situation where I was about to lapse off of my parents insurance and their office (very kindly) offered to get me in for surgery before that happened, since I wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it afterwords.
</p>
<p>
I was really worried about hair removal, but I had done 5 laser sessions plus about 8-10 hours of electrolysis and wasn&#39;t seeing too much regrowth, so they told me that I should be fine, that hair growth is unlikely after the follicular scrape and intraoperative electrolysis. They were always kinda hedging when they said this, so I never got a clear &#34;you&#39;re definitely fine&#34; but they didn&#39;t seem concerned about it at all. Unfortunately, I just hit 4 months out and it seems that I have a LOT of hair growth. It&#39;s really upsetting and the options for dealing with it seem really limited, so I&#39;m not sure what to do now.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately I don&#39;t regret having the surgery or anything, I&#39;m generally happy with my results apart from this, but I really wish I had just waited longer and gotten the full clear done. I feel like it&#39;s kinda irresponsible for Bowers office to still allow you to go through with surgery without being fully clear, but at the same time I guess I should have just trusted my gut and not gone through with it.
</p>
<p>
TL:DR If you&#39;re going to Bowers (or any other surgeon who doesn&#39;t require a full electrolysis clear) please just do the full clear, I promise you will regret it if you don&#39;t. Hope I can save someone else from suffering the same hairy fate.
</p>

How far into the canal is the hair? I’m an electrologist who works with the trans community, I can get about 1” in.
</p>
<p>
I strongly recommend doing the full 1.5 years worth of electrolysis, some hairs only pop up about once a year and it’s better to be safe rather than sorry. I’m so sorry this happened with your surgery, hopefully you can get some of it removed.

Yeah I wish I had done the full amount of electrolysis, but I couldn&#39;t really afford it and the combination of pain and dysphoria was really rough. Would have been worth it though. I would guess probably 2+inches, it&#39;s pretty deep, so IDK if there&#39;s really going to be anything I can do about it. I&#39;ve heard anecdotally about people preventing regrowth with PH balancing but idk if that really works

I get this I actually did laser for 2 years almost 2 years later no treatments cause covid no growth and opportunity to pursue surgery showed up and I knew I had to take it. Right as my consult came about suddenly got growth everywhere. I ended up scrambling and doing 6 months every other Saturday for 3-4 hours(had to go someone that didn&#39;t have trans experience and they weren&#39;t fastest - my original intended clinic couldn&#39;t get me in).  It looked pretty solid going into surgery. Shortly before surgery i got updated hormone levels turns out my T spiked from being in &lt;20 to 800s.
</p>
<p>
After surgery almost immediately had hair growth in surgical site but haven&#39;t noticed anything in canal but honestly I can&#39;t see in there and I dilate 3x day for last 8 months.. had some granulation issues and struggling sizing up. I don&#39;t do much touching so kinda clueless it there anything in there best I can tell think okay.

Point is those follicles can show up way later than expect and hormone alterations can cause sudden changes.

I did electrolysis but I like pain so I used no numbing or pain killing. Laser hair allows hair the chance to grow back anytime in the future due to hormonal or other chances.

Same.. I did Saturday&#39;s so my clinic wasn&#39;t able to arrange the lidocaine shot with nearby clinic that did that for them. So, I just watched caffeine intake and took ibuprofen after. Honestly after about hour of it I was able to just drift off almost sleeping. I listened to alot music shutting our their country music most time. The hard part well was try to mentally shutdown the arousal vie pain that I hate not the pain part. It&#39;s also just kinda difficult cause your laying there all vulnerable.. with my foot on his thigh as it did 1 hair at time.. I was going insane.
