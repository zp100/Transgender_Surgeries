Hip silicone implants vs. BBL? I am leaning more towards implants as thatâ€™s the only reason I wanted the bbl but I never hear about it on here, why?

Iâ€™ve never heard of a person having a successful butt or hip implant operation. They tend to be prone to shifting and infection and the results donâ€™t look entirely natural.
</p>
<p>
BBLs, on the other hand, are much safer than they used to be with more natural looking results. They can be extreme if you want them to be but it usually requires multiple operations to get that effect. Look for a surgeon that has a proven track record of doing ultrasound guided safe BBLs.

I had a successful butt implant surgery, I went to one of the best surgeons in the US who has tons of experience in performing butt implants. I wanted bigger ones but he put the biggest implant he thought would be safe and would eliminate complications... he told me straight up this is the biggest one (460cc+ bbl) I safely can put in you. a lot of people go wrong because they go too big. A lot of surgeons who talk down on butt implants itâ€™s because they canâ€™t do them....

Dr. Moises Salama, and he has experience in doing bbl and butt implants on many trans girls/yes I am happy. I went from no curves to curvy, and I have zero complications I just wish it was bigger.... but that is because I want a big cardi B booty. and no I canâ€™t feel them at all. I will say the recovery is MUCH harder and painful than a bbl (in my experience) Iâ€™ve also had just a bbl before all this so that was easier. The butt implants recovery was the most pain Iâ€™ve ever felt in my life but the clinic did not sugar coat this they had told me many times that gaining weight is a better option but it is very difficult for me. I gained 25 pounds and I still felt like it was not enough for the big booty I wanted so I decided to add the butt implants to the bbl.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the implants feel a part of my body I forget they are even their most the time and I think he did a great job of putting the grafted fat around the implant to blend in and camouflage it. It def does not look fake. It looks and jiggles just like a natural booty would but then again I also have my own fat in that area

BBLs have an incredibly high risk of complications. Most surgeons won&#39;t even do the procedure for that reason.

Downvote if you like but the above poster is correct. And implants are incredibly annoying to sit on.

They used to have a very high death rate, but the cause was identified around 2015 and new techniques introduced. Iâ€™m not sure what it currently is.
</p>
<p>
Thereâ€™s also some doctors offering it in less than safe conditions to get the price down.

Curious about this, too.  When I think of all the &#39;fat dissipated&#39; stories, implants seem like an attractive option.

Hip implants I have seen look odd. Sometimes bbl has looked odd â€¦ but do what you think you need

Both has some serious side effects that need serious consideration â€¦ but yeah it&#39;s more of a preference
<em>
if you can&#39;t have both
</em>
or if you can&#39;t get enough fat bbl. it&#39;s a very YMMV situation even if you DO HAVE enough fat you won&#39;t know the final results for at least 6 months
<em>
and from what I have heard/read it seems you need 2+ session
</em>
ðŸ˜¬ implants are more immediate results wise though they can be prone to moving and other implant related issues like bii
<em>
breast implant illness
</em>
