These are weekly progress pics from my FFS on July 8th with deschamps-braly. I had forehead work (browridge, orbital, eyebrow raise, hairline advancement), rhinoplasty, chin + jaw (emphasis on chin with jaw adjusted to meet the new chin + small removal at the corner of the jaw by my ear), and trachea shave. I am a big girl, and I&#39;m Jewish. I was explicit that I wanted my face to match my body, my ethnicity, and my family. I didn&#39;t want a small nose / chin / forehead -- I just wanted to look like the girl version of myself.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Some milestones:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
~ 2 weeks: even though i still look kinda busted, i feel an instant change from the forehead work. The swelling here is minimal, and I can go into the world and feel like this alone is getting me gendered correctly. I&#39;m also starting to see myself in the mirror, and my energy is coming back. there is still SO much swelling around my nose, mouth, and chin/jaw, which is a bit distressing.
</li>
<li>
~ 4 weeks: i&#39;m starting to feel pretty! i&#39;ve noticed that my face is doing a lot of work for me. as long as i wear an outfit that keeps up, i am turning heads in a positive way (i mean, im 6&#39;1 with legs so i generally attract attention anyway). i feel like my expectations and pressure around my shoulders or voice have gone down. weirdly enough, i get really self conscious about my remaining facial hair (this hasnt gone away yet). the swelling under my chin has gone down finally, and i feel like i dont have a permanent double chin anymore. my nose swelling has gone down a bit unevenly at this point, and i get a bit scared about still having a bump. my cheeks have finally come back, and i can see my cheek bones again! this gave me a lot of confidence as well.
</li>
<li>
~ 6 weeks: i am hot AF. im eating real food, and texting my exes to make them jealous. the alignment in my gender from my FFS has spread, and i think i am basically the hottest girl on earth. any swelling remaining is really not that noticeable, even if my nose/chin/jaw are still vaguely lumpy. the things that bothered me about my body before barely phase me. i am not covering up my hairline scar inside or at night (without the bumps it&#39;s really not noticeable anymore), and i&#39;m not taping my nose either. which means that i dont have to wonder if people can tell &#34;i got a nose job&#34;.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
i know i have a ton of healing left to do, but at this point im feeling SO positive. i have no clue how all the swelling will go down, but the improvement to my emotional wellbeing is huge and significant. i think it will only get better. i feel way better about participating socially, without the inside dysphoria firing off in the background constantly. people comment that im friendly and nice, and i feel like social effort is just easier.
</p>

happy to chat more if anyone has any questions about individual procedures, the lead up or recovery, or whatever.

I love this. Do you feel you reached your goals? You feminized very smoothly. You look like a cis-sister version of your before picture. I had FFS with Cardenas in 2016. Are you seeing benefits yet like blending in while you&#39;re out in public? How are you feeling about your surgeon choice?

Oh congrats! I feel like I blend in a bit with cis people, but that was never quite my goal. I‚Äôm still quite tall with shoulders, and if anything I now feel more comfortable taking more risks with my style ‚Äî I like being clocked, and now I can be clocked for reasons I want.
</p>
<p>
I feel really positively about my surgeon choice. It‚Äôs impossible to know how things will turn out, and you kinda just have to go with your gut. I was able to find someone I trusted, and I‚Äôm really happy with how it turned out. I couldn‚Äôt ask for more.

Your quick notes super match how your pictures look.  Four weeks plus things really settled into beautiful.  So glad things went well!
