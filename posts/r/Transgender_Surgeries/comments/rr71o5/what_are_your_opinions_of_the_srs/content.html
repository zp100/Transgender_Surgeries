I&#39;m going to be very honest and blunt here:
</p>
<p>
Some parts of the results look
<em>
very
</em>
cis like, some of the inner labia and clitoral hood bits pass for cis. A few results look really, really amazing.
</p>
<p>
But the overall trend I&#39;m seeing is the results are sloppy, haphazard, and freaking HUGE. Some look like they have tumor like growths. Others look like their vaginas are eating up their entire pelvic area. Going back a few pages and I&#39;m seeing things like inner labia being &#34;glued&#34; to the taint almost all the way back to their anus with the perineum raphe then showing prominently and going all the way up into the vaginal canal, hugely uneven labia, big globs of raw flesh bulging through...
</p>
<p>
I feel like the girls who are telling you these are cis identical need their glasses checked or something. I don&#39;t want to be disparaging towards the lovely ladies who got these done and I sincerely hope they are incredibly happy with their results, but if you&#39;re looking for a more cis-accurate result there is way too much of a coin toss here. I see a few that look
<em>
almost perfect
</em>
...but they&#39;re hidden amongst a
<em>
lot
</em>
of results that look really not to great from an aesthetics perspective.
</p>
<p>
If you have to go with this surgeon I would gather the best results and be EMPHATIC that you want results like he gave these girls. Explain to him what you
<em>
don&#39;t
</em>
want to happen, etc.

Thanks you!! I thought I was going crazy with how BIG most of the vulvas looked, so it‚Äôs nice to have that concern validated. The surgeon is apparently very open to ‚Äòdesign notes‚Äô and the aftercare provider I‚Äôd be going through suggest bringing photos of what you want. But yeah I‚Äôm worried with the variation you point out, especially in size. Like maybe he can do something closer to what I would want, but his default definitely seems to be bigger is better.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, at this point he‚Äôs looking like my only option. After everything I‚Äôve read I don‚Äôt think I could handle the recovery from a Chett/Suporn surgery, and while I considered it for a while I think I‚Äôve ruled out zero depth.

Yeah you aren&#39;t going crazy, the vulvas he creates trend towards the MASSIVE. It almost looks like he goes crazy using ALL of the scrotum to create these huge labia majora. Sometimes the majora are so huge it almost looks like they&#39;re not there because they&#39;re just so massive and taking up so much of the pelvis.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to hear he&#39;s open to &#34;design notes&#34; because when he&#39;s on the ball it seems he does a really nice job on many aspects, it just seems like sometimes he goes a little mad scientist and is like &#34;we can make her bigger...no....NO...EVEN BIIIIIIIIIGGGGERRR!!!!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I would specifically bring pictures of
<em>
his
</em>
surgery results and show him what you like--and what you absolutely want to avoid. Tell him you would like smaller labia minora and that having a smaller vagina is important to you. It would hopefully help him to see what on his own work you&#39;re looking for.
</p>
<p>
Personally I would consider these ones some of his superior results:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://thesexchange.com/?p=2218" rel="nofollow">http://thesexchange.com/?p=2218
</a>
-This is overall one of the best I&#39;ve seen on his page. Nice result in general! Very natural looking clitoris and inner labia.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://thesexchange.com/?p=2212" rel="nofollow">http://thesexchange.com/?p=2212
</a>
-The &#34;ending&#34; of the labia minora aren&#39;t great on this one (it has that whole perineal raphe issue going on) but otherwise this looks very nice. The clitoral hood is very nice, the inner labia look good. There&#39;s some oversizing going on here but still well within typical cis size ranges for inner/outer labia. The aesthetics of her vagina while she&#39;s just hanging out with her legs spread (but not using the q-tips to open the labia) are very nice looking, very natural appearance.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to go through and pick girls&#39; individual results out on this blog and call them &#34;bad&#34; on the internet, but for you personally you should
<em>
absolutely
</em>
be blunt and show him results of his that you want to avoid. This is a serious body altering surgery so don&#39;t be afraid to be a little uncouth and direct. It sounds like you have a good idea of which ones look a little more &#34;off&#34;, so go with your instincts.
</p>
<p>
I hope you feel at least a little confident going with him! He has some great results mixed in there, I think he just needs to refine some techniques and definitely stop doing his surgeries at 7x magnification and then he&#39;d produce some quality results reliably lol.

Thank you so much!!! This feedback is SUPER helpful, esp the results you linked. I agree they‚Äôre some of the best ones he‚Äôs done. I would just hope that they‚Äôre intentional and not luck of the draw, there‚Äôs so little about him in the English speaking world so there‚Äôs nobody that can be like ‚Äúyeah I asked for X and he gave me exactly that‚Äù. But hopefully in time üò¨

You&#39;re very welcome! I am very glad this helped! I hope they&#39;re intentional too. I suspect if he takes his time and has specific notes beforehand you&#39;ll get a nice result. And if he goes a little too crazy with the inner labia that can be fixed easily. I would concentrate on the outer labia being so large and the whole raphe/&#34;gluing&#34; of the inner labia towards the bottom, tell him you don&#39;t want the inner labia extending down so far (cis women don&#39;t have inner labia that go down to nearly their butt crack, they end AT the hole and just kind of envelop it, that&#39;s one of the dead giveaways on his surgeries, the obvious taint skin you see near the bottom of the vagina between the bottom of the inner labia). His clitoral hoods and clitorises are some of the better ones I&#39;ve seen even among his more well-known peers, and in general his labia
<em>
do
</em>
look very realistic.
</p>
<p>
I hope you end up with wonderful results! üíï He has a lot of great positives, it&#39;s all about asking him to combine them for what you want aesthetically.

That‚Äôs all excellent advice, thank you! And yeah I‚Äôm not so fussed with bigger inner labia because I could always get a labiaplasty locallay down the line, it‚Äôs a pretty simple walk-in walk-out procedure afaik.
</p>
<p>
While you‚Äôre here, are there any non-US (due to cost) surgeons who‚Äôs results you‚Äôre really impressed by? You seem to really know your stuff and keen to see if there‚Äôs any I‚Äôve overlooked!

Hmm...well I&#39;m non-op myself (I know, I know, I just lurk here because I&#39;m always happy to see my sisters and brothers getting what they need to feel happy in their bodies!), so I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m an expert on any of this, but I do know a few Thai surgeons I&#39;ve been generally impressed by the results. Suporn is the obvious one.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.kamolhospital.com/en/gallery-MTF/mtf-sex-reassignment/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Kamol
</a>
has what looks to be a similar technique as Dr. Theerapong, but it seems he has
<em>
much
</em>
better control over the whole &#34;BIG OUTER LABIA, SO BIG&#34; issue. All of his results are what I would consider decent with a few being INCREDIBLE standouts on there, which I&#39;m sure you can pick them out of you look!
</p>
<p>
What other surgeons have you looked at?

Interesting! All the results I saw from Kamol had the vaginal opening below where the labia ended, which seemed off to me. His staff also have a bad habit of doing dodgy PR in this sub. But he‚Äôs the only other surgeon I know outside the US doing PPT so I‚Äôve def considered him!
</p>
<p>
Other surgeons I‚Äôve looked at are Chett and Suporn. I like both their results aesthetically, but I‚Äôve heard recovery from the ‚ÄúThai method‚Äù skin graft srs is HELL. I also looked into Miroslav in Serbia a little (he also works in NY sometimes I think), but I only found one result from him and it wasn‚Äôt pretty.
</p>
<p>
Lowkey wish I was in the US so I could just figure out insurance and go to one of the well known PPT surgeons. I feel like Thai surgeons used to be the best in the world, but they‚Äôve missed the boat a little on newer techniques.

<p>
The outer labia or the inner labia? Because it&#39;s super common for inner labia to not extend all the way down to the vaginal canal. My BF (also trans) has like nearly nonexistent inner labia. I feel like Kamol&#39;s techniques look super similar to Theerapong&#39;s but just kinda...smaller. Both sometimes have that deal where they utilize too much of the raphe but other than that it seems like they&#39;re similar but smaller or larger.
</p>
<p>
Also yeah that&#39;s an unfortunate thing a lot of surgeons do, the whole dodgy PR thing. Dr. Kaushik out of India is known for doing that too which is a shame because he&#39;s produced some really great results but he&#39;s also been caught doing some real shady shilling stuff. Dr. Kamol seems generally on the up and up though besides some of the dodgy PR.
</p>
<p>
Yeah Chett and Suporn are both known for the comparatively hard recovery. Still, perhaps it&#39;s something to think about if you&#39;re really liking their results. I&#39;ve rarely seen a negative review from either so I think that stands in their favor, and while the first few weeks are terrible and the first couple months you need to be careful physically, the end results are still some of the best aesthetically I&#39;ve seen. But if it&#39;s something you&#39;re not up for it&#39;s really smart to be looking for alternatives! PPT is a great alternative!
</p>
<p>
I agree with you about the Thai surgeons losing ground on newer techniques. A lot of them are just coasting on a slowly less-and-less deserving reputation of being the &#34;sex change epicenter&#34; of the world. A few great ones are left but the rest could really stand to brush up on their craft.

Ohh interesting re: kamol and labia placement! I‚Äôll def take a second look. I feel like I just saw all the dodgy PR and kinda discounted him, which was maybe unfair.
</p>
<p>
Thank you SO much for all the input, you‚Äôve been amazingly helpful ü•∞ I thought I‚Äôd already researched myself to death but there‚Äôs always more to learn!
</p>
<p>
EDIT ‚Äî I just looked at the actual results on Kamol‚Äôs website you linked before, and WOW. I‚Äôd only seen results here on Reddit, the ones on his site are unbelievable. In the sense that I‚Äôm not sure I actually believe them haha. The 1 month ones don‚Äôt even have any scarring or discolouration? I‚Äôve never seen surgery heal that fast that perfectly.
</p>
<p>
I won‚Äôt link to it because I don‚Äôt want to talk poorly about anyone‚Äôs results, but there is one I saw here on Reddit and to be extremely blunt, my first thought was ‚Äúit looks like a stapled down penis‚Äù. I felt so sorry for her. Certainly very different than the ones on his site, they seem a little too good to be true.
</p>
<p>
But if they are, then damn! He would totally be my first pick over Theerapong

Personally I have a lot of love for surgeons who can give ample labia minora. Not every single woman on earth needs to have the pornstar look. I like how long labia tend to look like flower petals when lying flat!

While I wouldn&#39;t recommend you do something you feel strongly against already you should still consider that it may not be a big deal to you afterwards, personally I don&#39;t care that I have a labia that doesn&#39;t look like my preferred vision, because it is my labia and I am just happy to function normally. Women come in all sorts of shapes.

I am scheduled with dr.Thee (march 12th) and after I&#39;ve read this post I asked my gf, my mother and my sister what they think about his results and if the overall is too big or long
</p>
<p>
my gf told me she has labia minora to go down almost to the anus and she has that part of skin between the bottom of the labia minora (and she has to shave it because is external skin she said)
</p>
<p>
both my sister and my mum told me the only one different things is that labia minora should thin as they go down and don&#39;t stay this big at the bottom but that&#39;s it
</p>
<p>
also lot of people here on Reddit complains having too much gap between ends of labias and anus so is really up to you
</p>
<p>
I have googled for &#34;big labia pictures&#34; or &#34;long labia perineum pictures&#34; and figured out lots of girls have labia going far down (but thinning as they do this)
</p>
<p>
personally I will ask Dr Thee just to thin labia minora as they go down and to have smaller labia Majora to have that &#34;sandwich look&#34; like    | /    instead of having it too close like    / which I don&#39;t like (pls consider that I like meaty vulvas more than closed barbie look, I need my labia minora not been covered by majora)
</p>
<p>
(ps: if you look into the &#34;editions&#34; folder on
<a href="http://thesexchange.com/?p=44" rel="nofollow">thesexchange
</a>
you will find the evolution of his method during years and there he explain why labias are so long and why perineal skin is included between labia minora)

It would be ideal to do this in a revision a year later if you can manage it. If anything goes wrong its a lot easier to fix if there&#39;s extra material, and you&#39;d probably end up with better aesthetics.

I&#39;d avoid to fly back to Bangkok to revision so I would prefer to keep my meaty labia instead
</p>
<p>
yeah one of the reason why he creates big and thick labia is to make recovery and penetration easier, and using the perineum to make the posterior forchette is to have less pain during dilatation

Just a note but if it‚Äôs just the labia, that can be done as a labiaplasty revision by a plastic surgeon in your home country. It would be no different than aesthetic ‚Äúrevisions‚Äù on a cis vagina.
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôd only need to fly back to Thailand if you wanted structural or more complex revisions (eg: adding/moving tissue) that need SRS speciality

I usually hate using porn as a reference for anything because it‚Äôs so unrealistic, but I‚Äôll second that the ‚Äòmeaty vagina‚Äô porn subs were actually really reassuring haha. I found some girls that looked quite similar to Dr Thee‚Äôs results.

yesss is completely normal for girls who have big and thick labia to look like this, indeed the reason why I always liked Dr.Thee result is I use my gf&#39;s vulva as reference which I&#39;ve always loved it because is meaty and thick

First of all congrats! Hope it goes well, and if you‚Äôre comfortable to do so please share your experience here afterwards. This sub desperately needs more reputable write ups on Dr thee.
</p>
<p>
I agree that his results are definitely in the realm of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, and he has some really wonderful case studies. Though I also agree with another person that said he has some unnaturally huuuge vulvas, so I can only hope they were by choice of the patient rather than random variation in his consistency. In my own talks with Siam Transformative (who are one of the options to handle liaison with him) they said you can be quite specific with what you want, so that‚Äôs a big plus.
</p>
<p>
If I were to go with him I would factor in an almost definite labiaplasty later on. But that‚Äôs quite a straightforward outpatient procedure that any plastic surgeon specialised in that area can do, so I‚Äôm not concerned with the size/‚Äúmeatiness‚Äù of the labia themselves, more just the structural variation I see between his cases.
</p>
<p>
Anyway good luck! I still think he‚Äôs one of the best surgeons, and tbh who I will probably end up going to one day myself.

thankyou!! I will share my experience of course, I am planning to share weekly updates for the first month then monthly updates in order to add more information about this almost unknown surgeon
</p>
<p>
I am going via Siamtransformative too as they are super kind and they already helped me a lot
</p>
<p>
Yes you can be very specific on requests but at this point idk anymore if I would ask to have shorter labias. His method is used to reduce pain during dilatation and penetration and having shorter labias may include so much pain
</p>
<p>
However I will ask for smaller labia majora and thick labia minora that I can thin up later with revision as you&#39;ve suggested, for me is very important to have the sandwich-look for the stand up view
</p>
<p>
I will also ask about perineum skin between labia minora and if there are other options I&#39;ll let you know
</p>
<p>
if meatiness of labias and size are not your biggest concern then may I ask what do you mean by &#34;structural variations&#34;?

Yeah I‚Äôm not concerned about the size of labia because, while it‚Äôs not my preferred aesthetic, it‚Äôs easy to remedy later with a labiaplasty and as
<a href="/u/HiddenStill" rel="nofollow">u/HiddenStill
</a>
says you‚Äôll likely end up with better overall aesthetics if you treat any vaginoplasty as a 2-stage procedure with a planned revision.
</p>
<p>
My concern with Dr Thee is the sheer SIZE of some of the overall vulvas. Like some of them take up the entire pelvis, with the labia majora damn near extending down the legs! I‚Äôve never seen a cis vulva like those examples, and unless the patient requested it I‚Äôd be really scared of that happening to me.

WOW. It appears that the aesthetics is because of whatever methodology he is using in genital crafting. I&#39;m guessing they look so big and fleshy because he is utilizing more of the base material (penis). Maybe more material aids in maintaining sensation????
</p>
<p>
I work at an OB/GYN clinic; meaty genitals do exist. I&#39;m just glad mine ain&#39;t.

Yeaaah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm starting to think too. I think his work looks pretty cis-passing for that, like, style but I‚Äôm beginning to think I don‚Äôt want it. Which is a bummer because he‚Äôs pretty much the only decent option for PPT I could go to

I personally feel that him is an excellent option (the best if you really want PPT) if you are looking for a very natural and good aesthetic, from what I saw on the page there is a great diversity in terms of the size of the labia minora (Even if you decide to go with him you could tell him your thoughts regarding your labia minora), I personally want to have very long labia minora, I am also considering almost the same surgeons as you (Dr. Sutin from PAI instead of Dr. Chett, Dr. Teerapong, Dr. Bank or Dr. Suporn)

Great to hear! Seems like every person either thinks his aesthetics are amazing or his aesthetics looks nothing like cis ü•¥
</p>
<p>
I still haven‚Äôt decided myself. I‚Äôm not agains the ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù labia, you can always get a local labiaplasty in future, but I am a little concerned by the overall size of the vulva, like the height if that makes sense

If this is your only option I would seek out a plastic surgeon who does labiaplasties in your area and show them these pictures and inquire about how they would go about to make it less &#34;meaty&#34;.  I think you would be pleased in doing this in two steps to ensure your desired aesthetics. This doctor is leaving a lot of meat; a plastic surgeon should be able to play around with that.

Imho it&#39;s more cis passing to have somewhat more visible labia minora. I prefer it over the barbie pornstar look for sure. Plus it can help cover up more internal aspects that I don&#39;t super love lol. And honestly the labia sensation is so underrated in the bedroom

That‚Äôs a great idea, thanks! Yep I think a labiaplasty would definitely be in my future if I went this route, I‚Äôm more concerned with the overall structure/size/‚Äòheight‚Äô if that makes sense, which I doubt could be changed later without major revisions
