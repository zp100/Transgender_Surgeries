pee after surgery. what is it like peeing for the first time after surgery? do you have to learn that? how does it feel compared to before? how long does it take to get used to it? Do you still often reach down and only then realize you don&#39;t have to hold anything anymore?

The Sunday morning they removed my packing and pulled my cath, they told me I had to pee before I could leave. I drank a lot of water and waited.
</p>
<p>
When I felt the urge, I went to the restroom, sat down and . . . waited . . . and waited. Then I turned on the shower and that old trick worked. I felt something relax in me and I was peeing and yes, it was a different sensation.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon is a reconstructive urologist, as well as a plastic surgeon, so I never had a problem with peeing all over the place like other girls describe.

It&#39;s amazing.  It was honestly one of the first post-op joys I had honestly.  I didn&#39;t need to get used to it; it just felt natural to me.  I&#39;ve never reached down post-op.  You&#39;re brain adjusted pretty quick because this is how your anatomy was supposed to be anyway.

That got me for a while. Like my brain had trouble letting myself pee because my hand wasn’t down there and therefore I thought I’d be peeing all over in front or me. Took peeing a few times to convince my brain hands free is safe

I don&#39;t know if anybody &#34;reaches down and realizes it&#39;s not there.&#34; You are aware of it being gone, always--in the beginning the surgery site is so painful and tight there&#39;s no mistaking it...and then after everything is healed you&#39;re so used to it by then that it wouldn&#39;t occur to you.
</p>
<p>
Peeing itself is entirely different from peeing as a man. The urine takes a few secs to come out through a penis, but if you&#39;re not careful and your pelvic floor muscles aren&#39;t exercised, you could pee on yourself trying to get your pants down. There&#39;s no delay between &#34;I&#39;m going to piss&#34; and &#34;I&#39;m pissing,&#34; it happens the instant you relax. You&#39;re going to be peeing as soon as your ass hits that toilet seat.
</p>
<p>
At first, early in your recovery, it will spray everywhere, like a ceiling sprinkler, and get your whole ass wet.

Just sort of worked for me, I had an idea it would due to feeling in the area when the catheter was still in. First time it was like a sprinkler, but it is settling down although it still goes backwards, and thus I am my own personal bidet! I feel I go more often than I used to b4. It&#39;s nice to just sit and go without having to aim, or hold anything.

I feel like the first time was easier than I expected. Your urethra is shorter so instead of holding in your pee at one spot you hold it in a little bit higher if that makes any sense.

I didn&#39;t have to re-learn anything because I had a perineal urethrostomy for several years before bottom surgery that was pretty much identical to post vaginoplasty functional sensation. I had to have the urethrostomy reversed at the beginning of last year in anticipation of vaginoplasty this year, but it didn&#39;t change that perception shift at all.

Could you make a post about all that? There&#39;s very little posted on that procedure and nothing on having it reversed.

My first time peeing after I came off the catheter was an interesting experience to say the least. Given that I was only six days post-op and still rather swollen. That said I peed with the urine running down my butt. My only issue was getting used to wiping myself including my butt (after poop) from the front. I have gotten used to it since.

Three months after surgery I have a very occasional straight out pee. Usually have a very high coverage area. Hope to see improvement sometime.
