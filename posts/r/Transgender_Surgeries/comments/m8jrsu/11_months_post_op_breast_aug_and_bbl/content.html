Thank you! I went to Dr. Daniel Medalie in Beachwood, OH. I got 485 cc Natrelle Inspira SRM (smooth round medium) profile under the muscle.

That&#39;s really close to what I&#39;ve been considering too!
</p>
<p>
How did you end up deciding on him as a surgeon? I hadn&#39;t heard of him as a trans surgery provider before, but looking on his site there&#39;s a header for transgender, so he&#39;s obviously experienced with previous trans patients.
</p>
<p>
In my area all the surgeons who have experience with trans patients ONLY do saline implants over the muscle, so I&#39;ll either have to travel further, or go to a doc without as much trans experience &gt;&lt;

My friend had ba with him and recommended him to me. I went to the consultation and found he was really good with transgender patients. Then when I was in the lobby I met another patient who was a trans man that had traveled from the UK to have Dr Medalie do his chest surgery. So I thought, if someone traveled from Europe to Ohio just have Dr Medalie perform their surgery he must be good. I am extremely happy with my results.

Any chance you could say how much was? I’m in Ohio as well and it would be pretty cool not to have to travel much!

How natural are they? How do they feel to you in your body? How do they look lying down? I hate my boobs so much and want augmentation so badly so I hope it&#39;s ok to ask
</p>
<p>
What type of implants are they? How do they feel to the touch

They look and feel natural. I can’t really feel them in my body it just feels like I have boobs. They just feel squishy to the touch like any other breasts. When I lay down they move but they just look like boobs. They flatten out a bit but natural breasts do that. I have Natrelle Inspira smooth round medium gummy bear implants.

Huh... Flattening is actually a good thing afaik! I herd a lot of impnats are the opposite. Stick out super hard and weird while the fat shifts Making the implant obvious.
</p>
<p>
How do they feel to touch? How many ml are they?
