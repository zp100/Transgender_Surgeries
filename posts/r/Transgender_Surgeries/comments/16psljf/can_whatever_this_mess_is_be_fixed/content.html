Any revisions should be after fully healed.  Look at Dr. McGinn, Dr BBL, Dr. Ting, Dr. Avanessian, Dr. Purohit, Dr Stiller, Dr. Ley, Dr. Min Jun, Dr K at uchealth  , Dr Del Corral  Dr. Ramineni, and Dr. Theerapong. Also Dr. Wittenberg.

Definitely a no to Ramineni and Wittenberg for revisions at least!
</p>
<p>
For revisions, try Dr. Ley, Dr. Ting or Dr. Santucci for revisions! I work with Trans women and those two doctors are the absolute best for revisions. I used to recommend Dr. Bluebond but her office has changed their policy so now revision cases that are not originally RBL have to wait until 2028 for a consult without the possibility of being moved up from the waitlists!

OMG!!!   I knew who the surgeon was without even opening the post.    The look.  The shape.  The scars.   The awkwardness of it.     You were touched by The Butcher.

I had surgery with her in 2018.   It was a horrible experience.   When in 2018 were you?

Dr. Ting helped fix my Rumeritis in 2021.

It seems to me like it should be a relatively easy fix, there looks to be some extra skin in the labia minora area that could easily cover some of the pink area. This is honestly the most realistic result I’ve seen by Rumer, besides the fistula of course (I’m very sorry you had to go through that). For an aesthetic revision just make sure you like how that surgeon’s results look.

Did you have a piece of skin above the vagiipenkng which didn’t heal and had to be removed?

Since Rumer is the topic I have to copy/pasta this list and petition for search algorithm reasons. It helps get the word out since she pays off google and advertisers to astroTurf her image. You can also save this list in a .txt and post it whenever someone considers Rumer. Her license will never be revoked thanks to all of the red tape that protects her so its up to us to defeat her through a war of attrition by denying her as many new patients as possible until she goes bankrupt. Fuck this doctor and fuck her right wing legal team.

Dr. Rumer attempts to silence two of her low income trans patients through a SLAPP suit. Rumer used a right-wing affiliated transphobic legal team and brought the case before an anti-LGBTQ Trump appointed judge.

Rumer casually admits to going through patients&#39; medical records in order to witch hunt her detractors and labels her own patients as “transphobic trolls.”
