Having GCS w/ Kathy Rumer at the end of July. Saw some photos during consult but was wondering if anyone would be willing to PM me more if possible, along w. your experience in general? Would be greatly appreciated!

Cancel it immediately. You can tell her Hannah Simpson convinced you if you like.
</p>
<p>
[hannahsimpson.com/surgery](
<a href="http://www.hannahsimpson.com/surgery">www.hannahsimpson.com/surgery

) is my own site, it speaks for itself.
</p>
<p>
And also check out
<a href="https://rumersanonymous.blogspot.com">https://rumersanonymous.blogspot.com
</a>
because it’s full of others peoples’ experiences as bad or worse. She is dealing with multiple lawsuits currently and I’m not even a party in any of them.
</p>
<p>
Besides her poor technique, what was most deplorable was that she gaslit me saying things looked good when they clearly didn’t, and she blamed me for complications that could not possibly have been my fault. I have emails to back this up. She tried to sell me on a free tummy tuck procedure when she realized she wasn’t going to easily be able to fix my vagina.
</p>
<p>
Marci Bowers ended up working on me later and made things even worse, in no small part due to how badly it was screwed up first which she only realized upon opening me up again, but my site clearly distinguishes what it looked like prior to that and then after.
</p>
<p>
Cancel. Reschedule with someone else. Nothing is worth the experience of constant torture I have had the last six years and the coming to terms with the reality it will likely NEVER actually function or look properly for the rest of my life. Please please please do not go through with it. I don’t know you, but I cannot wish this on anyone.

Hannah, I&#39;m sorry this happened to you. Are you unable to have colovaginoplasty to rectify all this? It seems like your the ideal cadidate dor that procedure? Be well. My heart goes out to you.

I&#39;m going to be very bluntly honest and so sorry if I sounded kinda biased or whatever but Rumers results just look horrid and botchy looking to me that&#39;s why I&#39;m sticking to Thai doctors because they look the most natural to me bc of their technique.

Holy Cow, she has a rap-sheet.
</p>
<p>
I went to see her 5 years ago for a consult for FFS because some people in my town mentioned that she would work with me to try and get insurance to cover it. I realized something was wrong when she started showing me facelift after facelift. Chin implant after chin implant. I said &#34;so you never -remove- bone from transwomen&#39;s faces? you just add implants?&#34;
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s legal to market yourself as a trans specialist with this many red flags, but I&#39;m SO GLAD that everyone is spreading the word here. Even if your insurance covers it, DON&#39;T do it.

She is an absolutely horrible Dr. Everyone I know that has used her has ended up broken. Find someone else.

I’m writing from personal experience with Dr. Rumer. My surgery was completed on 7/31/2019 and I couldn’t be happier with the results. I’m fully functional, I’ve healed well (six months so far) with no major complications to date, and everything looks amazing. (My results far exceeded my expectations.) It’s everything I’ve always wanted and more. Her staff was kind and professional from the very beginning. Dawn and Jen are wonderful and are a true pleasure to work with. Jefferson Methodist is a clean and modern facility. The nurses were very attentive and I never wanted for anything. They took great care of me during my stay with them. Bed rest was a challenge, but I got through it. It’s a distant memory now, but I was a bit miserable at the time. Dr. Rumer is absolutely fantastic. She knows what she’s doing and she cares about her patients and the work she performs. As with any surgery, it is vital that you follow all pre and post-op surgical instructions carefully. Assuming you’re having a similar procedure, dilation will be your biggest challenge. That part is largely up to you. Your final results will ultimately depend on how faithful you are to following her post-op surgical instructions and dilation regime. It’s also important to communicate with her office if you’re experiencing any issues as they arise. Don’t wait. The sooner an issue is addressed, the better. Remember to be patient with yourself and to listen to your body. Recovery is different for everyone. Please consider reaching out to me with any concerns you have and I’ll do my best to respond. Best of luck!

DO NOT GO TO RUMER. SHE IS CALLED THE BUTCHER FOR A REASON. ALMOST EVERY &#34;NEOVAGINA DISASTER&#34; WAS DONE BY HER HAND. INSURANCE POINTS GIRLS TO HER BECAUSE SHES CHEAP, BUT SHES BAD, NOT ACCOUNTABLE, AND MUTILATES TRANS WOMEN FOR PROFIT. CANCEL.
