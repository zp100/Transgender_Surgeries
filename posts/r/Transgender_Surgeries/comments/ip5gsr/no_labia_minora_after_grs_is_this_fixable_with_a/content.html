No labia minora after GRS. Is this fixable with a revision?

Its been 9 months since I&#39;ve had my surgery with Brassard and I can day that I do have some labia minora. Its not exactly alot but it is there. I do remember when I was at 3 weeks it also didn&#39;t seem like I had any at all, but the swelling at the time didn&#39;t make it easy to see anything at all.

FWIW I‚Äôm at 2-weeks post-op (different surgeons) but there‚Äôs still wasaaayyyyyyyyy too much swelling to tell final appearance.
</p>
<p>
I think exercising patience would be good here. A hell of a lot can change over the coming month to two months in getting an idea of final appearance.

I&#39;d say give it some time. At 3 weeks post op for me, everything was so swollen to the point that it was quite difficult to distinguish between labias majora and minora. In time, everything settled down to the point that I have well-defined &amp; folded inner labia. In retrospect, more than I thought I had the donor material for. My point is that our vulvas can certainly surprise us as time ticks on. Best wishes x

I&#39;m almost 4 months post op and I&#39;ve had tons of complications! (Hypergranulation to the max, yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, tightness, intermittent swelling, pain, discomfort, constant discharge, worse of all, the beginning stages of vaginal stenosis, bc of scar tissue buildup) I haven&#39;t really explored down there properly.
</p>
<p>
I think I don&#39;t have a labia minora either or it&#39;s hidden.  I get close to a clitorial orgasm, maybe even able to have a baby one, but that&#39;s it so far. Nothing toe curling by any means yet. Haven&#39;t tried achieving a vaginal orgasm yet and haven&#39;t had vaginal intercourse yet either. Besides, who would be in the mood anyway?! üòÇüòÇü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
I will definetely need ongoing treatment and a revision when I hit the 1 year mark.  Every girl&#39;s body is made differently - thus we all heal differently. I know some girls with zero complications.
</p>
<p>
Btw, I don&#39;t agree with people with zero complications trying to muffle those with complications. I&#39;ve seen that on various threads and it&#39;s quite obnoxious. Never change/minimize your truth or narrative for someone else. It&#39;s a waste of time, and most of all, lacks authenticity.

I think this is one of the areas where amount of donor skin plays a role in outcomes.  So it may not actually be a surgeon error, just part of the variables in any srs.

I wasn&#39;t like super small or anything, and Dr. Brassard assured me there was plenty of donor tissue to use in my pre-op examination and did not mention this being a potential outcome.

It could be something about your body or it could be he just messed-up.   He is kind of known for being consistant.  Everyone gets five inches of depth.  The inner labia is a problem area for penile inversions.   Sorry you are having issues.

At 3 weeks post-op you are nowhere near healed, and you still have a
<em>
lot
</em>
of swelling that you likely don&#39;t even realize is there. It takes about a year for all of the swelling to finally subside, and for everything to kinda fall into place. It will look
<em>
much
</em>
different in several months than it does now.
