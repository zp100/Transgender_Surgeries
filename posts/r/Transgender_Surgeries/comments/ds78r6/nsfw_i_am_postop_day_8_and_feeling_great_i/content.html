I am insecure so I was hesitant to post, but this may help someone and I‚Äôm fully confident and happy in my results. I didn‚Äôt want to be the percentage that was happy with their result and not show it bc I want to give hope for those that want to get this surgery. I am doing this for educational purposes and for the sake of getting my surgeons the exposure and reputation they deserve.
</p>
<p>
Any hate or harassment will be immediately blocked so don‚Äôt bother lol. Worst case scenario‚ÄîI have the power to delete this anytime I guess.

<p>
I got my GCS done at the U of U Transgender Health team by surgeons Dr. James Hotaling (Urologist) and Dr. Isak Goodwin (Plastic Surgery). They did amazing and I could not be happier with my vagina only one week post op! The best part of my whole experience is the entire staff‚Äîincluding my surgeons! They are just as excited as you are (maybe even more)! They made me feel loved and actually checked up on me nearly every single day in person. I‚Äôm not sure if other surgeons would do that? I got 15cm (6 inches) depth and already have a lot of sensation. You can easily see my vulva, clitoris, urethra, vagina, and my labia majora and minora. My surgeons achieved this in a one step penile inversion Vaginoplasty.

</a>
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd highly recommend them to anyone, they will take full care of you! If you do not want to wait a long 3-4 year waiting list for a top surgeon then please look into the U of U and consider them. ATM I believe they have a 3-4 month waiting list. AMA.
</p>
<p>
EDIT:
</p>
<p>
THANK YOU for all the compliments! my vagina and I are feeling extremely loved!!
</p>
<p>
Here are some other photos just because I‚Äôm feeling generous and I‚Äôm loving the positive vibes :)

Yes! I could not be more happier with my decision! They are fairly new to GCS but I hope to give them the reputation they deserve! Surgery took 7 hours and my surgeon took his time to make the best outcome.

Wow thank you!!
</p>
<p>
I did start HRT at a fairly young age (15). Puberty did catch me for a couple years in the early stages but luckily it didn‚Äôt effect my voice too much. I‚Äôm not gonna say it didn‚Äôt effect my voice completely, I just still thankfully have a pretty good range to work with‚Äîalthough male puberty did do it‚Äôs part and gave me an Adam‚Äôs apple which I‚Äôm hoping to get removed sometime.
</p>
<p>
I could actually make my voice very deep, and when I sing since I‚Äôm already using a high register part of my range it can be difficult. There‚Äôs small things I do that can help a bit, I can maybe make a video about it!

I do! When my nurse first helped me dilate she touched things down there and I felt sensation already. But it can take anywhere from 6 months to 1-2 years to gain full sensation I believe.

This makes me so happy to see great results with someone within the country. So far I&#39;ve only seen results like this with Chet and I really don&#39;t wanna go out of the country for this due to expenses. Thank you so much for posting this

hey I was exactly the same way! my insurance does cover travel expenses but I would have gone through the process of getting all the pre-auths which would take more time. Dr. Suporn/Chett/Kamol were on my top of the list for Thailand but I didn‚Äôt feel too comfortable having to travel that far. getting it done in my home state was just extremely convenient and honestly I could not imagine having to travel after a surgery like this. honestly, it was perfect because my insurance worked with them so got it covered 100% and only paid my deductible. so thankful to be in my own bed by day 5 so it was extremely convenient and the best choice I made I think.
</p>
<p>
obviously going to a pretty new surgeon is more risky than going to a well known surgeon but that‚Äôs what consultations are for and they blew me out of the water. the process moved way fast for me and I got my GCS in a matter of two months after my initial consultation visit. of course, very glad with my decision and want to share my amazing surgeons! I do believe they compare to the top surgeons even internationally rn IMO. they are aiming to build a top GCS center here in Utah and I would say that with my results it is easily achievable:)

Thank you! My insurance covered in full so I just paid my deductible ($2K). I have a high deductible plan but with transitioning expenses I met it fast and got my surgery paid in full.

They may have estimates for out of pocket if you reach out to them:

Oh yeah I‚Äôve heard of that center and actually had them at the top of my list. I honestly couldn‚Äôt afford to wait and save to pay for travel expenses to go elsewhere and pay for lodging and such.

That&#39;s awesome you had somebody close by. Where I live I&#39;ll have to fly to any of my surgeons so I&#39;m screwed in that sense. Your results have given me some more hope in that this is the right move!!! Super jealous btw üòÅ.

What methods do they offer for vaginal construction?  Seeking ones that do more modern or experimental like perineum.

Thank you for posting!  I was hesitant to go forward but I know I really should.  The choices are hard because of the wait.

Do they need you to go get electrolysis first?

They do!! They actually work with medical estheticians on the transgender healthcare team that they refer you to. They are lovely ladies and I felt so comfortable! They are very familiar with trans patients and will make sure to make you feel comfortable and use the right pronouns.

They do both laser hair removal and electrolysis depending on your preference but I got four sessions of laser hair removal entirely before the surgery and they do scrape the hair follicles during surgery as well. I can continue my laser sessions once I‚Äôm healed enough.

I would start by knowing how you‚Äôre gonna pay (through insurance or out of pocket) then reach out and book a consultation as soon as possible to get the ball rolling!
</p>
<p>
My surgery timeline was something like this:
</p>
<p>
Getting a consultation booked (called one day when I wanted more info and got an in person consultation with my surgeon that same week in a matter of days), then getting laser hair removal treatments between this time and also getting my psychotherapist referral letters (2) and mental assessments from them, once I had my letters I submitted to the hospital and they did the pre-auth with my insurance to verify coverage (took about a month and a half after my consultation to get approved), then waiting for a surgery date once coverage was approved (took about another month‚Äîbut you‚Äôre on the waiting list at least at this point), then I finally got my surgery date around the 2.5-3 month mark after my consult. My first surgery date was scheduled 3 months out. One week later I get a call saying there was a cancellation so they moved me up since I was on the waiting list and I got my surgery two weeks later after getting my surgery date. All in all, took around fully 3-4 months since my initial consultation to get GCS/GRS.
