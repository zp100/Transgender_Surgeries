even if OPs acc looks suspect can we consider for a moment that this is probably her result and y&#39;all saying it&#39;s a terf posting a &#34;disaster&#34;, how would you feel if that were you ? especially at 4 months post op?
</p>
<p>
anyways, OP, I&#39;m not just saying this to make you feel better but it&#39;s not a disaster. looks better than alot of pics I&#39;ve seen around here anyways

Letting everyone know: Go through this person’s profile, it’s pretty sus. They post in anti/trans subreddits, and have said inconsistent things in their posts.
</p>
<p>
Edit: OP’s results were amazing, so I looked into her post history to see the recovery process, and I found her posting on truscum and gender critical, and thought she might have been a TERF trolling us but
<em>
I never said this person was lying, only suspicious
</em>
(and yeah posting in gender critical as a trans woman is suspicious)

I read through it. For people who&#39;d like to avoid it, OP and her partner are both trans women post-SRS and that&#39;s confusing people. OP does have some strong opinions on hormones, SRS insurance coverage, and the need for dysphoria to be part of being trans which are controversial (and that I disagree strongly with), and they did reach out to an anti-trans subreddit (gendercritical) when they were banned for posting about their views in ask_transgender. But I didn&#39;t find anything that strongly suggests this post is fake or that she isn&#39;t a trans woman.

That makes sense. Honestly, because her results looked so good, I was just curious about her journey, and I found her posting on truscum and gender critical, and thought she was being inconsistent with her SRS timeline because I didn’t read which one was about her and which was was about her girlfriend

Fair enough! I didn&#39;t think you were lying, your comment is accurate enough, just some people took it as this person was fake/trolling when I really doubt that. No issues with your post, it was good to have that information. I just wanted to make sure we (as a subreddit) were having an informed conversation.
</p>
<p>
The results are amazing and the progress since the last photograph is clear. Each time I see great results, I&#39;m more inclined to pursue SRS for myself.

There is a really toxic thread called ‘neovagina disasters’ that seems to set up scenarios like this, as to then feed back the responses of people. Wouldn’t be surprised if they had some affiliation to that thread, or even that thinking.

I see we all received downvotes for speaking against it. Clearly they have a presence here. Their obsession with something that has nothing to do with them is pathetic.

This is the second time that I&#39;ve seen people posting fake results on here. I have no idea what these peoples end-game is with this, but fuck them.
</p>
<p>
Edit: both of the times I&#39;ve seen, the surgeons they &#34;went to&#34; are known to be really bad ones, I suspect they just want more content for neovagina disasters, which if true, is beyond fucked up

As far as I know dr Sinclair is not known to be really bad. He’s an amazing doctor that treated me very well. Stop trying to give him a bad reputation. Wtf is wrong with you.

Not fake, and thanks for calling my result a disaster. You’re an asshole. Other people have different opinions though? Either way I’m happy with my result so you can F off.

No, I said that people are trying to trick trans women into going to known-bad doctors so that

they

inadvertently make content for neovagina disasters. I have seen this happen multiple times.

Yes but dr Sinclair is not a known bad doctor he’s an excellent doctor and you slander his name by even saying something like this. Have you even researched my doctor?

Your result looks good, great even.
</p>
<p>
But i did look into dr. sinclair. And while he looks like someone who cares, he looks too spread out.
</p>
<p>
Its incredibly difficult to be a master at all forms of trans surgery.
</p>
<p>
They can still provide, tip top results like yours, but their technique wont be as precise leading to greater variation between the best and worst results.
</p>
<p>
In short, id be hesitant to recommend this surgeon when there are better options that dont rely as much on luck.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, i think visually your result is amazing for 4 mo but based on what ive seen from dr. sinclair it could have been a lot worse.

A little soreness from when I dilate , my only form of exercise right now is skateboarding and I do it without any pain! So I’m pretty happy about that. It was really lame the first 3 months I couldn’t do any of that and it was driving me crazy. Thanks for the words :)
