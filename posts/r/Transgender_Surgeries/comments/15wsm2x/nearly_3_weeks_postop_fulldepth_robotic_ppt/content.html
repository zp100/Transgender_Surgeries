Did pope assist? When I had mine with Gupta, Pope screwed up my entire labia. I‚Äôve had 2 surgeries since to try to fix it, one of which being an emergency surgery because of how bad things got.
</p>
<p>
Your results look good. Congratulations

Pope helped out with mine, she said everything went as planned so I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt have any issues!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm sorry things went how they did, that must‚Äôve been really mortifying to realize

That‚Äôs awesome for you. Legit.
</p>
<p>
I keep wondering how she screwed up so clearly on me. Yeah but kind of rough giving up the summer for multiple surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Great tip, once you can get #3 and #4 in well invest in toys. Haha. It makes a difference.

Hello Amanda I&#39;m also seeking the same surgeon and type of surgery but I was wondering if you were far along enough in treatment to let me know how the PPT method has affected smexual stimulation. I was also curious if they required Electrolysis and if they provide it at their Cleveland location? Any response is welcome!

Hiya!! I‚Äôve witnessed SIGNIFICANT improvement in sexual function throughout my recovering. There was a frustrating period of time in which the nerves would decide to ‚Äúturn off‚Äù the moment I decided to masturbate, but now I can have clitoral orgasms whenever I please (though it does take a bit of work). Penetrative sex has been good the two times I‚Äôve had it so far, and honestly I think their team did a wonderful job.
</p>
<p>
They did require electrolysis but I didn‚Äôt get it with UH. I got it with Janine Wilkes in chagrin falls (not that far from Cleveland). I highly recommend her as she‚Äôs done multiple patients of Gupta. She does everything for the right reasons and prioritized my comfort over all else.
</p>
<p>
Each session is $115 each and it took me rough to 26 sessions‚Ä¶ Good news is my insurance reimbursed it all after they attempted to deny coverage for my surgery
<em>
and
</em>
electrolysis on the basis of it being gender affirming care (which is in violation of the 14th amendment). Janine actually offered to set us up with a lawyer but insurance quickly apologized and covered both after my family threatened legal action.
</p>
<p>
Please lmk if you have more questions!! My dms are open and tbh I‚Äôm not anxious about talking about the awkward stuff, especially if it‚Äôs going to help someone &lt;3
