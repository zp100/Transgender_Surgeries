Hi. I&#39;m a post op mtf trans person whose voice was damaged during a botched trach shave when I had FFS. That was back in 2008. I can speak okay, but my voice gets very tired on a regular basis. My tone is still pretty masculine. I am often called &#34;sir&#34; on the phone. I cannot scream or sing. It&#39;s impossible to maintain pitch when singing. I was doing some research on voice feminization surgery and came across the UIC Institute for Voice Care web page (
<a href="https://www.chicagovoicecare.com/glottoplasty.html">https://www.chicagovoicecare.com/glottoplasty.html</a>
). I&#39;m in Chicago, so UIC is convenient for me. They also take my insurance. I&#39;m just wondering if anyone has experience with them, and what their experiences are. Thanks.
