Hi I wanted to inquire about Dr. Courtney Cripps from NYU on her experience with vaginoplasty surgery. She was a residence in NYU and has recently started up residency at the University of Chicago.

<p>
If anyone has information or experience with her I&#39;d love to know more

hi! i guess this is where we start with dr. cripps bc i am 2 days post opp FFS with her and she was top notch start to finish. felt extremely extremely safe with her and her whole team at UC. this is a pretty painful procedure!! the first two days are really no fn joke!!! everything went pretty much perfect though and im following my treatment plan stringently. i&#39;m a pretty private person so i&#39;m reluctant to post photo results but i will post written updates after a week, 2 weeks, a month, and whenever else.

Hey would you be able to update on how You&#39;re feeling about your surgery experience now that it&#39;s a few mos out? I recently had a initial consult with Dr Cripps for top surgery and trying to get a little more info before deciding. Thanks so much, hope things are going well!!

Update: I had my appointment with Dr. Cripps and her team on Monday and honestly she seemed really good! Actually talked to me about my needs and was transparent about the potential complications and risks of each. Even without prompting we spoke about looks and placement. Her specialty is peritoneal pull-through, which is what we&#39;re going for. Only thing is she doesn&#39;t have extensive decades of experience (three years according to her), but was trained by the top members of the NYU Hospital plastics team. Answers follow-up emails promptly too!
</p>
<p>
So at least I feel like I had a good meeting with her if nothing else. I&#39;ll meet with her again as potential surgery date options get closer.

Did you end up pursuing surgery with her? I am scheduling with her soon -- obvi she is a bit more of a ? but I&#39;ve heard and experienced good things with her; being in Chicago is a huge +

Here’s GRS surgeons in the USA, and she’s not there yet. She’s going to be higher risk.

just a follow up! i got my surgery w doctor cripps yesterday and it went super well. she was super professional and her entire team was amazing. i’m staying the night in the hospital which is uncommon w top surgery, but i’m glad she did it bc it’s making it easier to take care of myself for that first night of recovery. highly highly recommend if ur looking for a chicago gender affirming surgeon !!

I also have an appointment with her for October now, for top surgery FtM. I found some info on the doctors she worked directly with in her NYU residency but also am looking for references from the Trans community on any experiences with her. I’ll post the articles I found that I’m talking about in a sec.

I got my top surgery done yesterday from Dr.Cripps. She really did a great job! The surgery only took a few hours. The staff is very friendly and visited me twice while I had to stay over night in the hospital. And thank god.. the first day was rough painful and happy I had someone to help with the first night. This Doctor is very serious about getting the best results. I’m wearing a binder that normally fit an abdomen. She preferred that binder because it compresses better than a regular binder. The only thing that hurts right now is this binder rubbing on my armpits. They don’t want me to take it off for any reason until my follow up appointment in a week.

I know this is an old post but maybe someone will see it. I&#39;m ftm, but Dr. Cripps is doing my phalloplasty and I couldn&#39;t be happier so far. I had my first stage of alt phalloplasty 12/14/23 and a debulking stage on 3/5/24. We&#39;re currently waiting to hear back from the urologist so we can get stage 2 scheduled. But Dr. Cripps and her team have been amazing. I was in the hospital for 5 days after my first stage and there were days that she was in my room 2 to 3 times. Her team was in my room 3 times a day for the first few days, then twice a day. Everyone was extremely respectful and Im incredibly happy with my results at this point
