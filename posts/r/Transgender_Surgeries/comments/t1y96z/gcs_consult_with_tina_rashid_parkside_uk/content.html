Hi All, I had my consult with Tina Rashid Wednesday gone. Managed a down and back from Scotland as a day trip. Thought I would write up my experience in case it assisted others.
</p>
<p>
The consult was at the Parkside clinic in Putney, access is easy from Heathrow to the wrong side of Putney Bridge via the District and Piccadilly line in about an hour. On the way there I made the mistake of using bus 220 which took an hour to do about 6 miles (lesson learnt!). If you have time to kill then the monster shopping centre that is Westfield London is &#39;on the way!&#39;
</p>
<p>
Its a 15 min walk from Putney Bridge to the consult which is at Parkside&#39;s Putney building rather than the one at Wimbledon. Once there, ignore the reception downstairs and head up to the 4th floor and take a seat as per the sign on the desk (I stood there like a lemon!!)
</p>
<p>
I was scheduled for 15:00 and was seen at about 15:20, so I would advise not cutting it too neat for time if you have a scheduled return.
</p>
<p>
The discussion began re what I was seeking surgery wise, and then some notes were taken down:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Age
</li>
<li>
Date of  transition
</li>
<li>
Medical history
</li>
<li>
Family medical history
</li>
<li>
Whether I had any previous surgeries
</li>
<li>
Dose and method of hormones and blockers
</li>
</ul>
<p>
She used a cut-away model of the area on her desk to illustrate where the various bits go, and then went on to explain the risks. I was most concerned about the potential of a fustilla which is one of the more serious risks. She commented that in 400 operations she had had one, but the risk was stated at 1%. Some of the other risks were higher, including a 15% chance of no sensation afterwards. Blocking of the Urethra, pee coming out at wrong angles, and tissue (including the clitoris) dying due to inadequate blood supply were among the other risks.
</p>
<p>
Then came the examination, initially behind the curtain with the nurse, Miss Rashid then entered and ascertained that there was sufficient donor skin, and that I would need only minimal hair removal (I have some hairs on the underside of the shaft). Thus far I have only had 4 hours of electro.
</p>
<p>
I dressed and sat down again, she asked a few questions re expectations - eg trying to make sure patients had realistic expectations.
</p>
<p>
Next was Q&amp;A
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I asked about the pre-op appointment which is usually 6 weeks before the operation, and whether this had to be in person. The specialist nurse apparently does this, and she said that if I could get the blood and urine test done myself, then this could be done virtually, which for me travelling from Scotland is advantageous. I asked about needing an ECG, she said that this was for the anaesthetist and she believed they would be happy without based on my medical history and the fact that I was fit and active.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I asked about stopping hormones and was informed that although its usual to be required to stop hormones 4-6 weeks beforehand. In light of modern bio-identical Oestrogen having a lower risk factor and depending on the patient there was an option to continue on hormones, providing it could be shown that levels were stable for over a year, and that a disclaimer was signed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I asked about sensitivity - and was informed that the aim was always to construct a sensitive clitoris and clitoral hood, but this could not be guaranteed, and that 15% of people would not experience a sensate clitoris. I asked what constituted &#39;no sensitivity&#39;, and was informed that this varied person-to-person. I believe that she was eluding to sensitivity reaching a level that would possibly enable an orgasm. I was informed that sensitivity can take a year to develop, and for patients who find that they do not experience sensitivity, testosterone injections into the area could be considered - but were not favoured by many patients!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I asked what happened re payment for fixing up serious issues such as fustilla, and was told that there would have to be an agreement with the hospital re how much this was going to cost the patient to have fixed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I asked whether more minor issues such as Granulation (treated with silver nitrate) could be sorted more locally to me. I was informed that this was not an issue provided I could find a gynaecologist who was willing!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lastly re depth. I asked if it was reasonable to ask her to prioritise less risk of bowel injury over depth, if, during surgery she ascertained that  creating good depth would be risky for the bowel, she said yes, but that this was her automatic fall-back anyway.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Finally I was asked about dates. My hope is September, as I can&#39;t bear to spend the summer months on my back dilating. I think it will be less tedious when the weather is horrible outside! She told me that her secretary Bolor would contact me with some proposed dates.
</p>
<p>
She and the nurse were warm and welcoming, and easy to talk to. I was not rushed and my (remaining) questions were answered fully. The stress of the getting there and minor nervousness I had in the waiting room melted away. I was only in for 20 mins tops.
</p>
<p>
She appeared to appreciate my realistic expectations and also the fact that I was well researched.
</p>
<p>
In short, I have every confidence in my chosen surgeon going forwards.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps others, I will post more as I get closer to surgery.

This is exactly how my consultation went too. In my case she told me I didn’t need electrolysis, but I was welcome to get it anyway (which I am doing in order to avoid any risk of hairs at the entrance)
</p>
<p>
Mine was also late by about 30 minutes, so be prepared for that.
</p>
<p>
She asked me to send some pictures of my perineum with and without an erection, which I did by email later that week.
</p>
<p>
She gave me a depth estimate by email when I asked for one. Obviously that is only approximate though.
</p>
<p>
In my case I’m booking my dates in June after I get my second surgery referral sorted, and I’m aiming for November this year. There’s a chance she will ask me to book a follow up as June is a few months away.

Thanks for response, out of interest, how &#39;far&#39; are you going with Electro, I have only had 4 hours down there thus far and was told I just needed everything gone from shaft (maybe 50 hairs), but I am tempted to go at the base a wee bit as well.
</p>
<p>
Its a good job she did not ask me for erect photo&#39;s (!) After 2.5 years of Decapeptyl I could not &#39;get it up&#39; if I wanted to!!

I’m also a Decapeptyl girl, I love it so much it’s so good!
</p>
<p>
I’m just getting as much done as I can. I don’t shave the area around the shaft and every two months I just turn up and say “do the highest ones first please”
</p>
<p>
I’ve had 30 minutes but I finally got pain relief that works for me, so I am gonna be getting more. In total I’ll only have about two-five hours because I’m so focused on just getting the highest hairs on the shaft.
</p>
<p>
I’m blonde and my hairs are weak af, so I’m not worried if a few small ones end up a centimetre inside me since they die pretty quick

What pain relief have you discovered? I am doing 2 hours at a time so far and it hurts like hell! I was using Emla (useless), and got some Numbskin (which is supposed to be 10% lidocaine), but that&#39;s also pretty useless, but better than Emla!! Whole lot wrapped in clingfilm after application!!

How long are you leaving it on for? How much are you using?
</p>
<p>
With the little EMLA tubes, you have to apply the entire tube. It should be like 1cm thick almost. Do your best to apply it over wrinkled areas with extra care, and definitely plastic wrap like you said above.
</p>
<p>
Keep it focused to the area you want done in that session, and apply it thick as hell. Don’t rub it in at all, just leave it on the skin.
</p>
<p>
I leave mine on for an hour, and take max paracetamol. If you can get codeine or anything stronger (LEGALLY!!) then use that too. Recommendation for genital tissue is leaving for 15 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I’m switching to a tattoo numbing cream since you get a bigger tube and it’s 10% (5% lidocaine 5% prilocaine, 1% epinephrine)

Lidocaine interferes with wound healing and shouldn’t be used for dilation in the first few months. You’d be better off with something like tramadol or one of the newer alternatives. But probably not much hope for that in the UK.
