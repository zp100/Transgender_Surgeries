Hi all, two weeks ago I had VFS with Dr. Thomas - in preparation for that, I wrote an app that has been pretty useful for me to get around and I thought I&#39;d share it with people,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anaisbetts.sirene">here&#39;s the link
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
For now it&#39;s free, I&#39;ll try to keep it that way as long as possible unless the server costs become too crazy. I rely on it every day right now and I&#39;d be pretty fucked without it, so imho that&#39;s a sign that it&#39;s Pretty Good :)
</p>
<p>
Anyways, just thought I&#39;d share in case it&#39;s helpful for other folx in the trans community!

Oh cool! Hope you&#39;re doing well, I think my partner and I saw you too (she was like, &#34;hey, that&#39;s the person that came in while we were leaving the surgical center&#34;)

I&#39;ve mostly been okay, the first day I was
<em>
super
</em>
nauseated and was afraid I was gonna hurl all day, but after that it&#39;s mostly just like a bad sore throat. Portland was an amazing city, we stayed right near that big shopping street, all of those cute shops were so great

How are you managing without throat clearing and sneezing? I have a bad tendency to sneeze and I worry about that

Even during voice rest, you can still sneeze or clear your throat - it&#39;s actually encouraged to fully sneeze instead of trying to suppress a sneeze which puts way
<em>
more
</em>
pressure on your throat  (Dr. Thomas will hand you a full page on sneezing as part of the aftercare info).
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself will make you want to clear your throat all the time (though the meds will help with that some), you can still do it though I try to avoid it as much as I can. It&#39;s not something you have to 100% avoid, just try your best basically

Sneezing and coughing don’t cause the vocal cords to vibrate as much as talking. Talking is the real bad thing to avoid.

This is so sweet! Maybe you could share this in some of the autism subreddits too, I bet those who’re mute, have selective mutism, or easily overwhelmed in social situations could benefit from your app.

I’m not autistic so I’m not really active in those communities, but if you’re up for it, I think you should message the mods over at
<a href="/r/aspergers" rel="nofollow">r/aspergers
</a>
and
<a href="/r/autism" rel="nofollow">r/autism
</a>
. They’d know how best to reach the target audience :)

Thanks, I&#39;ve added a link in the wiki.

What&#39;s the server costs for? It looks like it just runs on the phone.
</p>
<p>
If you ever want to improve it some help for women going to Yeson in Korea might be handy.

I wanted to learn Firebase, so I used Cloud Firestore for storing people&#39;s shared phrases. This is nice because you can just sign into all the devices in your house and it always works the same. I also installed the app on my partners&#39; devices so when I&#39;m not next to my phone I can just grab theirs
</p>
<p>
I probably didn&#39;t
<em>
need
</em>
to use Firebase but part of this app was just about learning new stuff and getting my new name in the Play Store to build my Professional Reputation™ since I want to move into doing mobile development
</p>

<p>
Do you mean things like translation? That&#39;s an interesting idea - the app will correctly read text in any language that you have support for in your phone (i.e. if you paste in a bunch of Korean text, it&#39;ll try to read it using the Korean text-to-speech engine)

Since you&#39;re doing this to build up your experience, and there&#39;s probably no money in it even if you tried changing, you could try a few other things. Making it work on an iPhone and common translations for Korea. Perhaps a calendar/timer for when you&#39;re allowed to speak, medications, etc. Can you record your own voice for the samples?
</p>
<p>
Actually having users might look good if you go for a job as well.
</p>
<p>
I guess you need to give it permissions when you install it? Does it work if you refuse?
</p>
<p>
Did you check out any other apps before making your own? If so, any chance of listing them and giving a brief review.

<p>
It actually works on iPhone, it&#39;s just way more of a pain to get into the App Store and way more expensive ($99/yr). If enough people want it I&#39;ll do the scut work to get it past the reviewers
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
No, it uses the built in voices on your phone

<p>
The only permission is the sign-in stuff, the app
<em>
should
</em>
still work even if you don&#39;t sign in though, but only for typing phrases. If it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s definitely a bug.

I did - there are some alternatives, but none of them seem suited for day-to-day use, they seem more like a tech demo than anything, or just like, spam. In particular, the way that Sirene reads
<strong>
and
</strong>
displays the text in huge font makes it much much less frustrating to use when like, you&#39;re in line at a coffee shop or something. Phones just don&#39;t usually have the volume to work in a noisy room.

It only needs Storage permission if you want to save your own phrases to play on command. It&#39;s also available in Europe. No ads.

Yeah, I don&#39;t have it translated and if you hit the &#34;Populate initial phrases&#34; button all the phrases are in English. I also didn&#39;t have the time to go through all the GDPR compliance stuff, so if I make it available in Europe I have to do it or else I can get sued / thrown out of the Play Store.

If I may ask, what was the precise procedure you had done?  Feminization lyrngoplasty? I know Dr. Thomas does multiple procedures and he was on my list of VFS contacts. I have a consult with Dr. Ornouma S. in Bangkok in June for Feminization lyrngoplasty . I have been told she is very good (and have heard her results) and apparently studied some with Dr. Thomas. I would love to hear your journey through recovery, as this is a surgery I&#39;ve considered for a long time (distinctly man voice that therapy voice won&#39;t change, don&#39;t want glottoplasty, etc). BTW thank you for the app!!!

Hey! I just wanted to thank you for making this app! I downloaded it because I am getting oral surgery (just some minor non-trans stuff) done tomorrow and I won&#39;t be able to speak for a few days. I&#39;m currently messing with &#34;saved&#34; phrases and the UX on your app is
<em>
amazing
</em>
. As someone who does development for mobile I&#39;m pretty impressed with the scope of the project so far!!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll let you know how it works! :)

Cool! There are still a few pieces missing (you can&#39;t even edit a saved phrase!) but tbh I didn&#39;t really miss them

Thank you for posting, this looks pretty handy. Is it possible to change the grid size on the saved phrases page?

Not at the moment, this is something that&#39;s definitely on my Todo list to improve, the hardcoded 2 columns works good on portrait phones but looks super silly on tablets.
</p>
<p>
tbh though, in real use I almost never use the saved phrases on the saved phrases page, I always use the custom phrase page and when you start to type a saved phrase you&#39;ll see it as a button
