As in, not needing to be on hormones for more than 12 months or not needing notes therapists.

If you&#39;re willing to travel to Mexico, Dr. Melissa Belmonte. She works under informed consent.
</p>
<p>
She did mine in August 2015, and I&#39;m very happy with the work.

I have no idea, and since I did this in 2015 the cost has likely changed,

Best to shoot her an email

I saw her in one of the searches I did of this subreddit. Seems like a really good idea considering the cost, and I get to live in Mexico for a few weeks!

I so wish she stayed in Guadalajara to recruit her into my gender affirming surgical team! Sucks she had to move.

<p>
You&#39;ll be in good hands with her :)

There are, yes. If you have a local trans support group/community, that might be a good resource to find a surgeon. You could also ask your PCP if they know of any competent, trans-friendly urological surgeons.

Any specific surgeon that you know of? I really don’t care about where they are as I’m open to flying in and having said procedure done.

I’d rather not, but not for any gatekeep-y reasons.
</p>
<p>
Besides, orchis are pretty straight-forward. I’d encourage you to find a referral through your PCP, and if not that- do some googling for urological surgeons in your area! Traveling for one sounds super unnecessary, unless you are truly unable to find someone in your locale :)

Thanks! It just seems like no urologist in my area would be down to perform an orchiectomy without me being on hormones for 12 months straight and with two separate references which is why I asked for a name.

Just commenting to add that a lot of surgeons might list their requirements for letters etc because of insurance requirements, and if you don’t care about insurance coverage it’s worth contacting the surgeon directly to ask them, not just to go by what their website might say. Hopefully someone here has some experience that helps :)

What do you mean by “insurance coverage”? Do you mean paying out of pocket? Or just “fine print” kinda stuff that they technically need on the website?

I mean that regardless of what the surgeon requires for their own liability, if they are reliant on a patient’s insurance company paying out, then they are going to require that patients are meeting the requirements most insurance plans have for WPATH. Some surgeons won’t even set a date for surgery without preapproval from the insurance company. So if you are planning to pay out of pocket, it’s worth talking to a surgeon’s office directly, even if their website says they require you to get the letters etc. because that may only apply to patients trying to get insurance coverage.

Yw :) Unfortunately it has been my experience that most surgeons have terrible, outdated websites lol. It always helps to look for recent personal experiences from other trans people to get a better idea of what to expect.

Where are you located? In some countries like Thailand there might be official regulations that actively prevent informed consent genital surgery, in others like Spain it might be fairly easy to find one just by contacting private clinics.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also heard there are some surgeons that offer surgeries like this but don&#39;t actively advertise it because public knowledge can get them harassed by verious anti-trans activists, so it&#39;s probably worth contacting a few and asking about it.

I’m in the US. I’ve thought about going abroad but idk. I’m currently messaging urologists in my area and seeing if they’re cool with it.
