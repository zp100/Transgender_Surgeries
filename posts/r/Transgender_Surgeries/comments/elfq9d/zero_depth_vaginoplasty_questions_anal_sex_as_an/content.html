It is not absolute zero, AFAIK doctors are not allowed to perform REAL zero depth vaginoplasty, plus it would look extremely unnatural. From what I read from girls who had zero depth, it is actually something between 2 and 3 inches usually.
</p>
<p>
I considered zero depth but decided not to. Yes, SRS recovery was tough (I am 6 months post OP so I am okay now) but I would go through it again if necessary.
</p>
<p>
The thing is I wanted my vulva and vagina to be as close to a cis one as possible. Yeah, every girl wants that but the reason for me wanting that is that 99% of the people don&#39;t know I am trans and I didn&#39;t want to disclose it to anyone, sexual partner or not. BUT at this point I don&#39;t think this will be possible, I don&#39;t think my results are that great.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, do consider the possibility of wanting vaginal sex one day. You can give up on dilating if it is too time consuming for you, but afaik you can&#39;t go back and have a vaginal canal made if you decide for zero depth. Good luck!

Actually, from what surgeons advertise, it IS possible to go back and have vaginoplasty with skin grafts or colon segment; it just obviously won&#39;t be penile inversion. Of course there are considerations that play into the feasibility or desirability of taking this route, but it IS possible to get a vagina installed later on.

Interesting, I haven&#39;t seen this information before. That is cool, though! The more options the better!

How does vaginal sex (or stimulation) compare to anal? I guess I’m afraid I’ll like the feeling with shallow depth and wish I could have more. But the recovery sounds like it’s so intense and painful.

Vaginal stimulation feels very good, but I haven&#39;t played around with my canal that much yet. It is different. Anal feels good but at least to me it lacks that warmth that comes from playing with my genitalia (and I say this as someone who is yet to orgasm after SRS).

I have had shallow depth GCS one year ago with Pierre Brassard in Montréal. My recovery was faster than the recovery from girls who go with full depth.  I was able to go swimming at 5 weeks post-op. I am fully orgasmic.  I have an indent of a bit over 1 inch of depth.  I have a sensate clitoris that allows for orgasmic pleasure and my labia feel sensitive as well.  My results look great. They look nearly indistinguishable from the full depth results.  I do not regret having opted for this option.  I didn&#39;t want to take the risks that come with full depth.  I didn&#39;t want my life to be disrupted for a long while. I wanted a fast recovery.  I can finger myself with the shallow depth version.  I also use probiotica to give my vulva and the indent the natural probiotics a cis woman has.  My scars have faded nicely and are nearly invisible.  My labia are well defined.
</p>
<p>
I am bisexual so I saw myself in a possibility of ending up with either a man or a woman as my partner.  I have a boyfriend now. He likes my genitalia and I can derive pleasure from them too.  I still have anal sex from time to time. Mutual oral sex and breast play are very satisfying too.  With a little creativity there are tons of ways to have a good sex life.
</p>
<p>
My surgery took 90 minutes whereas full depth takes 2 hours with Brassard.  Full depth comes with a 3 month recovery time table and minimal depth comes with a recovery of about 4 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t want to have to dilate, I didn&#39;t want to leak fluids for months on end ( very common in the first year post op) and I didn&#39;t want granulation tissue in the cavity.
</p>
<p>
This surgery worked for me.  I was advised to go with full depth and I was told I would regret shallow depth but in all honesty, I regret nothing.
</p>
<p>
Anal sex still feels very pleasurable.
</p>
<p>
The neovagina is built in front of the prostate so anal comes with reduced sensation after SRS.  The prostate is accessible through the neovagina as a bonus and as an extra stimulant as a pro.
</p>
<p>
I weighed the pros and the contras carefully before deciding on shallow depth.  Would do it again.  The surgeon had more material to work with to give me a more natural vulva in one surgery. Most girls who go for full depth need a labiaplasty afterwards because their labia don&#39;t look very defined. My labia looked very defined from the get to. My indent is surrounded by the labia which also looks more cis than with most trans girls whose labia are above their vaginal opening.
</p>
<p>
If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

This sounds exactly like what I want. Im super excited about this procedure! I’m considering going to Dr Chet. in Thailand because I heard he gives some of the best cosmetic results and sensation and that’s what I care about the most.
