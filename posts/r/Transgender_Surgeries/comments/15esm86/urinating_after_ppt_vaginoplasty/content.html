Mostly just a rant. Went home from the hospital today and am very swollen in one labia. I&#39;ve had a catheter in for 6 days and trying to pee is not easy ATM. I bet as things heal it will be easier, it just sucks currently.

If it is difficult - or worse, not possible - to pee to the point where you feel like you are not emptying your bladder,  you really should probably be recathed.  It totally sucks, but way better than potential complications from not emptying your bladder.  The swelling sometimes is just too much to make peeing properly possible, and so you just need to give your body a little more time.

No matter what, you&#39;ve got this and it will get better.ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

Fuck. You&#39;re right. I called the hospital, waiting to get a call back from the doctor now.
</p>
<p>
Edit: did feel like I wasn&#39;t voiding all the urine. Was dealing with feeling like I would urinate, then half the urine would leave my body and the other half went somewhere else. Will probably update once I hear more from the doc

They should be able to do a bladder scan to see how much urine is left after you pee.  That will let them know if it is a problem which needs to be addressed with a cath or not.  It typically only takes a minute or two for the scan.

No urine left after peeing. It just gets stuck in the vagina. They gave some advice on how to handle this and pee better (if that makes sense)

Yeah... The inconsistency in peeing is a bit annoying, but it does settle down usually.

What helped me was just relax, emtting my mind and just letting it happen. Stressing about it and trying to push it does not help

Yeah, it was really difficult at first to get accustomed to it. It helped me to stand with bath water on to relax and start peeing, because the muscles just didnÂ´t know what to do.
