<p>
I had Gender Confirmation Surgery with Dr. Min Jun in November of 2022. The Crane Center itself is highly disorganized and unprofessional, to the point where I had to leave their care after less than 7 weeks post op.
</p>
<p>
The issues started with the Trans Patient Coordinator Valentina, who is one of the worst medical professionals I have ever encountered. She gives dangerous advice to prospective patients (she told one prospective patient on the phone all about her plastic surgery exploits in Columbia), and said inappropriate sexual comments to me during my consult. This is someone who should be not allowed near a medical office.
</p>
<p>
Valentina completely disappeared during my entire care from my preop appointment thru surgery to my post ops, despite an understanding that she would be highly involved.
</p>
<p>
Even worst is that every time I stated issues with my care to anyone at Crane, or that I wasn&#39;t comfortable with my care I was dismissed out of hand, even by Dr. Jun, as if my experience wasn&#39;t real. He came up to me in the hospital, laying in bed in pain and told me that I didn&#39;t know how a hospital worked, and that I needed to stop complaining, despite the administration at St. Francis being horrified at me having to wait a full hour after requesting pain medication. During a post op appointment in response to my pain concerns Dr. Jun said &#34;I&#39;ve had patients in way more pain.&#34;
</p>
<p>
They did not care at all about me leaving their care less than 7 weeks after reconstructing my genitals, and that in itself is absolutely horrible. My recovery was far more brutal than it ever needed to be, I felt abandoned. My mental health has been awful because of this situation, to the point of needing to completely numb myself with xanax just to stay alive. No one should have to go thru this without real support.

That has been my experience with them as well. Everything was fine I was a few weeks from surgery last year after I kept trying to follow up with them to know for sure that insurance was going to cover me. They kept reassuring me everything was fine then my insurance denied me about two weeks out and that put my mental state absolutely over the edge. At first they were responsive but now I can not even get them to call me back to help me with the denial. I really want to go to dr Jun but I’m not sure as time goes on that it’s the best choice

Sounds like he was a total jerk.  I am a physician and in my experience many surgeons do not understand and do not care about the experience of their patients. The truth is that many are just jerks with huge egos and a total disregard for the experience of their patients. Plane and simple. That is sadly true for many GRS/GCS/SRS providers. I have seen this problem both post GCS and post bariatric procedures… patients are literally left adrift and their concerns and complaints are played down or totally ignored (and are left for us, non surgeons to try to fix). Many doctors patronize their patients and make them feel guilty for having a complication or complaining. One has to have a suyo y personality and will to push forward and demand the care that we need.  I have heard and read countless reports from people that received poor care after their GCSs. Once the surgery has been completed many surgeons do not seem to care about post of care and the needs of their patients. Patients are quickly discharged from the assembly line. Providers often disregard the well know secret that post op depression is incredibly common (and could have a devastating effect in your recovery if not properly addressed). Some seem to care only about the money, and once the surgery has been done you can be dumped. Twenty years ago there were very few surgeons performing GCS in USA. Once insurance started covering the procedure in the last 10 years, there has been a proliferation of surgeons and centers, as they all see the potential for $$$. There some who are truly dedicated and care for their patients and understand their experience, but the majority don’t.  Recovery from GCS is a brutal experience. I would dare to say that it is almost impossible to relate in words. No amount of explaining would accurately describe how hard it is. Post op depression is common (because of the tremendous stress of the surgery, the temporary d/c of hormones in some cases (like mine) and the pain, lack of sleep and loss of everything that could resemble a normal life for SB extensive period of time.  Although patients are required to hace seen a therapist before the surgery and submit the “letters”, the truth is that therapist are not doctors (and regarding this topic. psychiatrist are, of all MDs, the least acquainted  with what surgical recovery involves) have no idea what their patients will go through and what the recovery entails.
</p>
<p>
I do not regret my surgery and got excellent care on my post op period, but once you return to your home town communications is always difficult and follow up is non existent as there are no routine scheduled visits: it is pretty much assumed that everything will go according to plan…and that is hardly the case post GCS… as we all experience sone form of a complication or a problem at sone point during our recovery.  I hope you get to feel better April

Nice post. I could not agree more. This mirrors my experience which took me years to recover from. Post-op depression is torure.

Yes, post op depression sucks indeed, and takes a long time to go away.

If you look at my post op writings, I documented my experience in detail over years. It was terrible.
</p>
<p>
But I made it through and so will you. For you it feels much worse than it really is. Everything will come together for you, but you need to get back to a routine asap. Stuck in the house or wherever with nothing else to occupy your mind is like stabbing yourself in the leg

Thank you, I will look it up. I am way better now and essentially off antidepressants. It was a combination of being post op, the fact that I did have to stop my hormones, and other unrelated events. And yes, as soon as I could walk, I forced myself to go out no matter whether its was rainy or cold (it was winter), and no matter how much I was still hurting (my surgeon was Suporn and the recovery for some Thai surgeons takes x2-3 what it takes for surgeons here, their results are awesome, but you pay for them)... I also had to force myself to eat and to have a very structured sleep schedule. Being a physician helped: I was able to recognize the depression despite a rather atypical presentation, I knew whom to call, and was able to push myself through it. That was almost one and a half years ago.... that first year post-op was tough, and the first 6 months were simply awful. But things look better now. Heading for my revision in a little bit over a month (a common second stage procedure for Super/Bank&#39;s patients) and planning to complete all other surgeries in the next 15 months. Thanks you again

Other than the difficulty with recovery, did you get the expected results from the revision?  Was that something you had to make a trip over to Thailand for?

I am actually quite happy with my result (when my gynecologist examined me a few months ago she just said that compared to other post patients she had seen in the US, mine was the closest she has ever seen to cis females). Suporn/Bank offer a free revision for cosmetic improvement and to address minor issues. In addition if you want to close the anterior and posterior commissures you can do it at that time (it cannot not be done at the time of their first surgery). In a way their technique is a two stage technique. You get 90% of the result with the first surgery (with results that look already great on average). But you can get the extra 5-10% once everything has settled down over a year later. In my case I want some minor fixes, including separating an area that has gotten stuck to my labia during healing and, if possible, having the anterior and posterior commissures done. I had to pay for my ticket and the hotel, but the procedure itself and all the care involved is free and was included in the fee for the first surgery. It will take place the next month. Honestly as it is now doubt anybody but a physician would be able to tell.

Be strong April and no matter how hard sone days may present, push forward. Things will get better. Feel free to reach out if you have questions. I have relied a lot on other girls who had surgery with my surgeon. They helped me a lot during the hard months. Your live will come back, be sure of that

Sorry honey 😪  He sounded so good on Youtube. I had a consult with the same type of urilogist in Detroit for robotic assisted peritoneal vaginoplasty 1.5 weeks ago. I have an exam with a plastic surgeon in June who does the outside part of surgery.

You look truly amazing.  I&#39;m sorry about your post op experience. I read that you live in wine country. I have taken a couple trips to Solvang. Really beautiful  country. How happy are you with the srs? Would love to chat if you are willing.  Jessica

I just had a consultation with him after waiting a year. Despite this ordeal and experience do you like your results? Was it worth it in the end (if you don’t mind me asking)?

April, so sorry your experience fell apart as it did. To be so bad that your best option was to leave the care completely says volumes. I do hope that things are going better for you now that you are away from all that, and the mend is progressing well.
</p>
<p>
Love and prayers to you in this time. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
