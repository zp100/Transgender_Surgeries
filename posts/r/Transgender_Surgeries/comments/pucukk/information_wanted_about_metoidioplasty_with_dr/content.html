I&#39;m interested in seeking metoidioplasty done by her, but I can&#39;t find much information about her or stories from her patients. All I&#39;ve been able to find with a long time of searching is one singular photo on transbucket with no additional information.
</p>
<p>
Would anyone be willing to share some of their experience with this?
</p>
<p>
Also, can anyone answer this question: what specific methods does she use (i.e. does she offer ring meta, centurion meta, or a different meta; does she do vy scrotoplasty or another; does she offer testicular implants and tissue expanders, and if so, what is the schedule/order of things; what does she use for the urethra graft)?
</p>
<p>
Also, has anyone with cigna been able to have it covered by insurance?

I was planning on getting a metoidioplasty with Dr Ley, but her new office at Gender Confirmation Center in San Francisco requires a one-year therapy history concerning just the lower surgery! I even called back and spoke to Christian (? - patient care coordinator) to clarify. Yep. &#34;So sorry. Wish you the best of luck.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been legally transitioned for 19 years and have had this plan for surgery in place since then. I see no reason to require a year&#39;s worth of therapy for this one requirement. After the initial conversation, what will we talk about for the remainder of the year?
</p>
<p>
First I was told it was the requirement of the hospital. I checked, and it only required a year of living in your gender. Then I was told it was the insurance. No, same thing. Is this a gate-keeper mentality due to the current political temperature? A CYA?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll put that out there.
