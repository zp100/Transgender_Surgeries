From Brisbane to Bangkok with surgery at PAI with dr Burin it cost me around $23k AUD including business class flights and a nice hotel for 2 weeks.  The surgeons fee was $17700.  I also did a bit of shopping in that total

I went to Suporn, it was around $25k USD if you count everything up. (this includes flight to/from for two (business class for me on the way back), accommodations for two while there, all food/etc., and the price of the surgery itself.)quick approximate breakdown:-surgery: 18kish-flights: $3500ish (one business class trip and two people)-lodging: $1500ish (two rooms on the fancy floor)-food/shopping: $1kish - i just didn&#39;t want to worry. so i ordered in a lot and just generally didn&#39;t limit myself. food isn&#39;t super expensive but it&#39;s not super cheap either.
</p>
<p>
given that I could see getting out of thailand paying $2500 for flights/lodging without too much issue/discomfort, though you&#39;ll want to check with the team of the doctor you&#39;re looking into for costs on lodging and local prices/what they recommend.

Great reply, but your costs are dated. Surgery in AUD is now AUD$27000 for Suporn, Bank and Prae ( the new surgeon) are less than Suporn, but only in region of 10/15% less. Flights and Lodging will set you back in the region of AUD$6000.
</p>
<p>
However best you get quote from Emma/Sophie on
<a href="mailto:admin@supornclinic.com">admin@supornclinic.com
</a>
. current official wait is in region of 12 months.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Suporn over Dr. Bank? Do you recommend Dr. Suporn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Thailand(Chon Buri)? How was Dr. Suporn&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

hey, to answer:
<br>
-Recovery has taken up much more time than I&#39;d like. It&#39;s mostly done now though, and I haven&#39;t experienced any major setbacks. It does seem like my body is less great at getting winded post-surgery, but this is my first major surgery so I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m also somewhat overweight.
<br>
-I knew 8 people who&#39;d gone to Suporn who all had great things to say. 0 of them had gone to Bank. Thus ... the devil you know. I&#39;ve heard great things about Bank though!
<br>
-I think he&#39;s a great doctor and surgeon. His practice has been kind of questionable to me in multiple places ... I saw someone get an infection and that wasn&#39;t caught at the hospital for multiple days, and they seem to not have great self-reporting of % change of complications (I highly doubt his reported rates of fistula as there have been several issues people have reported that aren&#39;t counted even though they practically count). Also, from what I&#39;ve seen/heard it isn&#39;t really a fully one stage surgery (I&#39;m going back for revision myself and everyone I know basically has, though you don&#39;t /need/ to). But I&#39;d still consider him among the very top.
<br>
-Cosmetics is pretty good, sensitivity is kind of eh. But I didn&#39;t have good sensitivity /before/ surgery. It&#39;s been good infrequently, kind of goes up and down randomly. I don&#39;t use it as much as I&#39;d like.
<br>
-Chonburi is a snoozefest but the people you meet more than made up for it in my experience. The hotel is really a different world.
<br>
-I have two soul source dilators, the orange and green; I&#39;ve only really used the orange. I prefer them for comfort; the material is much better. However, Suporn says to use his (the soul source dilators are curved and his aren&#39;t). After dilating only with the orange for a long while I just switched back, and there is a difference - and it&#39;s harder with Suporn&#39;s but I think it&#39;s probably healthier for the vagina &gt;.&gt;. Suporn&#39;s are made of acrylic and they get stuck in my vagina if I don&#39;t put a condom on the dilator itself, which is extremely hilarious until the fifth time it feels like you&#39;re window cleaning the inside of your vagina and the dilator just kind of pops in 2 more cm with some pushing.
</p>
<p>
also, thanks. :) I planned for it for a while. Am kind of relieved that dealing with it is mostly over, and hopefully it gets even further into my history as time passes.

I went to Chett earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Cost of surgery was approx 13k USD, which included all medical related expenses. The flight from central US was 700 for 1 person round trip economy (I would
<em>
highly
</em>
recommend traveling first class on the way back if you&#39;re able to) and the hotel stay was 1k USD for a month. I also spent around $800 for my 2 mental health professionals&#39; letters.
</p>
<p>
The only other costs were things like food which I didn&#39;t track since I consider them a regular living expense, and fees for getting my passport updated.
</p>
<p>
Also worth considering is the time you&#39;re recovering might mean you won&#39;t be able to work, so you might not have an income for a few weeks. Plus regular expenses like rent will still continue while you&#39;re away. Definitely have an emergency fund saved up before going into surgery.

I may have to revise this soon. It 8s around a year old. There are many other surgeons there will do SRS/GRS, but the ones I have listed are considered to be in top two tiers of International recognition

may be an option.

<p>
-&gt; Post GRS Revision Procedures ( prices may be for international clients and less for local ones )
</p>
<p>
A number of surgeons do revisons.
</p>
<p>
In general asking how much experience they have with revisions, and how it may affect sensitivity might be a good idea.
