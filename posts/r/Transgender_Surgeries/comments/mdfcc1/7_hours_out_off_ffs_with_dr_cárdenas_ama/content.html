Title says it. Surgery ended at 1pm (5 hours in the OR). I got: rhinoplasty (first time), lip lift, cheek fat transfer, buccal fat removal,  jaw contouring, and chin countouring. I&#39;m on pain meds so I don&#39;t feel much pain at the moment. Don&#39;t ask for a photo though!

I&#39;ve only got answers for a bit of those questions but I&#39;ll come back around as I get to see results. From what I know so far, yes, it went well. No complications at the moment. For a second I thought I had post-operative urinary retention but maybe I&#39;m wrong? I&#39;m still in bed, at the moment, and not allowed to stand.
</p>
<p>
As to the why? A couple of reasons (#not sponsored). - I know that Cardenas as some measure of recognition in the US and (especially) in Mexico. I have a passing top-half of my face but the same can&#39;t be said about my lower half and nose. Cárdenas is a popular choice for mid/lower face, seriously, google his work. I don&#39;t have a doubt in my mind that&#39;s he&#39;s a good doctor, my question remain as to how much was done. - I am bilingual, fluent in both Spanish and English. I&#39;m also a person of color (Latina Mestiza) although born and raised in the States. So, on one side, I wasn&#39;t nervous about talking to the doctor and being understood. There are translators and the doctor himself also understands English very well. The bilingualism has helped with the nurses and other doctors involved. - On the latina side, it was important for me to have a doctor that would understand the cultural differences between a white aesthetic and a brown aesthetic. I want to look like a latina, and Cárdenas, with his experience in biculturalism, would help with that very well. This was one of the biggest reasons for me. - Next, I have very supportive family in Guadalajara (it&#39;s where my father&#39;s side lives.) Due to personal reasons, my partner couldn&#39;t make it with me and, not very persuaded with the US doctors, I knew I had the option of coming to Mexico and find a supportive family willing to help me with recovery. - My options were Dr. Berli, Dr. Spiegel, Dr. Cárdenas, and Facial Team. Honestly, with family and bilingualism,  felt safer, yes safer, in Mexico. That sense of security has not gone away since Guadalajara is a great piece of Mexico with friendly folk. - I had also heard a lot about Cárdenas&#39; work. Online, pictures abound of his great work and it&#39;s rare (if not impossible) to find news of him botching the surgery. I have been very impressed with other girls&#39; results, definitely not complaining there. - In terms of price, it isn&#39;t a big secret that Cardenas is affordable. This website lists all the procedures and prices. We have to take into consideration that this price point isn&#39;t considered &#34;cheap&#34; in Mexico. This continues to be an expensive procedure to Mexican citizens and shouldn&#39;t be taken as a &#34;discount&#34; opportunity. Honestly, the price wasn&#39;t a negative, but it wasn&#39;t in the top 3 reasons why I went with him.
</p>
<p>
As of now, I do not regret my decision to go with him. I&#39;m extremely curious to know how much was done and I&#39;m especially interested in the results. All in good time, I will be writing more about my experience as I come closer to a month. I&#39;ll also be posting comparison pictures as well.
</p>
<p>
This all goes to say that my experience, in less than 24 hours of after surgery has been pretty good. I&#39;m obviously not being paid to say this. Please excuse any typos, I&#39;m doing my best here!

Espero que puedas disfrutar la ciudad, Guadalajara es muy bella, y (con la posible excepción de la ciudad de México) es la ciudad más lgbt friendly en Mexico.
</p>
<p>
I hope your recovery goes well.

Thank you for sharing! I&#39;ve been considering Dr. Cardenas and It&#39;s really nice to see that you have had a positive experience so far.

<p>
Just our of curiosity, being Latina, how did you have Cardenas do your surgery differently that you would expect a White person to have him do it?

Cardenas is a solid choice for just about everything outside GRS.  He&#39;s very good at maintaining a natural look which is good but doesn&#39;t always go far enough for some people. I had a lot of work done at his old hospital in Chapalita. I had three rounds of FFS over two years including an Orch. He did two rounds of Fat grafting to my butt and hips which has served me well over the years. He was doing BBL and fat grafting years before anyone here in the States. He&#39;s published several papers on the procedure. I just had my 15 year-old implants Cohesive gel implants replaced in December, here in the states. This was all paid out-of-pocket. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to  return to his new hospital if I was going to have more  out-of-pocket work done. He still maintains an excellent International reputation and you can fly to Guadalajara as cheap as anyplace in the States. The language barrier was never an issue, and I don&#39;t speak Spanish.
</p>
<p>
Hope your recovery goes well.

I got through the first 72 hours. Those were tough. I don&#39;t appear to have any infections not surgical complications as of now. My face is super swollen, definitely not an exaggeration when I say my face looks like a lego person. Some inflammation has gone down, i can see my cheeks now but my jaw and chin are gonna take a lot longer for sure. Overall, considering the procedures, I&#39;d say I&#39;m doing okay. I&#39;ll update as soon as  I can.

Hey! Thanks for asking! Im now 11 days post-op and I&#39;m feeling much better. I noted that the first 72 hours post op were pretty brutal (peaking at about 24-64 hours). My nose, chin and jaw are still very inflamed but I&#39;m noticing a lot of the work that was done. As my face develops more and more every day, I notice that I don&#39;t really recognize the person in the mirror. It&#39;s very interesting to me to say/notice that. I had no complications and the scars left behind are hidden very well. I will say that day 3-4 I struggled with a measure of post-op depression. The doctor allowed me to return to HRT 1 week after, I noticed my breasts shrank a good measure and I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not too permanent. I&#39;m making some notes on the whole process and expecting to post online when I&#39;m feeling more confident. Again, thanks for asking!

I didn&#39;t! I heard he does pretty well although slightly conservative about his approach. Maybe wrong though?
