It looks beautiful but to be honest none of the neo genitalia I&#39;ve seen passes as cis. It definitely gets close sometimes but if you know what to look for it&#39;s relatively easy to spot the difference.  But I think it could still be possible to have stealth sex in an environment with dimmed lights or with someone who isn&#39;t educated about the appearance of neo vaginas.

A closer view would help.   Also one with the labia spread apart.   Cis vaginas come in many varieties.  It can often take 12months for the swelling to resolve.  Still early to pass final judgment

From this angle she looks great sis.  Your clits exposed but I’ve see a couple “natal,” vaginas like that.
</p>
<p>
But I think the trouble with most of us is when things get more spread apart. The biggest note being labia minora usually ending before the vaginal entrance instead of encircling it. But, imo, if it looks good then I think it’s not worth worrying. And from what I see yours is healing great ‪♡‬
