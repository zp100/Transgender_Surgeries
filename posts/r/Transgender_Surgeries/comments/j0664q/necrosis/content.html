Please, contact your surgeon asap. I hug you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I had these two creams prescribed for better healing. First one (Furacin) is antibiotic and second one (Iruxol) is enzymatic debridement. I used to mix them 50-50 and apply on wounds and dark tissue. Circulation may be negatively affected by tightness in the inner vulva, and some skin may become darker. Enzymatic debridement will gently remove dead tissue, and antibiotic will prevent infection. Additionally you can apply Estriol cream (e.g. Ovestin) to improve circulation. You probably want to avoid sitting and lay with legs split to not compress the vulva. Massages will improve circulation too, so if you dilate three times a day, then if you massage every time it may help. Body can regenerate, dead tissue gets replaced with new tissue.
</p>
<p>
From my own experience. Around 3 month postop I had an accident. Boling water splashed tiny droplets onto my vulva. I completely lost sensation. I contacted surgeon and he said to immediately use ice packs. I had some dead tissue in few places. I used the two creams and that helped.
</p>
<p>
Please note, I&#39;m not a doctor, and I don&#39;t guarantee that any of that will work. Please, speak to your surgeon.

It&#39;s very good that you talked to your surgeon. I keep my fingers crossed for you and sending warm hugs.
</p>
<p>
If you want, you can ask your surgeon about debridement ointment, estriol cream, or hydrating cream. These creams can significantly reduce your discomfort and speed up the healing. Myself I just had my revision and I keep using them all the time.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, that accident was very scary. I was crying all day for few days until I finally got my sensation back. Now (after revision) I&#39;m also experiencing reduced sensation, but I&#39;m trying to not panic.

That black skin should slough off naturally, leaving healthy pink skin underneath. I don&#39;t recall exactly how long before it does but 10 days seems too soon. Mine sloughed off while I was bathing in the shower. Check with your surgical team when you can

Your surgeon should be available 24/7.  Maybe this isn&#39;t that level of emergency, but yikes that you could be so new and left like that.
</p>
<p>
It could be scabbing or just old tissue.  Is the black area new? Is it growing?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not something fixable really, but if the nerves are there it could just affect the size, not sensation

If your surgeon is one who has a reputation for questionable results, i would consider going to your pcp asap and perhaps an ER.
