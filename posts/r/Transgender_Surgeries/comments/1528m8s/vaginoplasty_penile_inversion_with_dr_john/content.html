I considered writing posts day by day of my experience after penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. John Brosious. However, I decided that it might be better to write a recovery post once I was recovering at home.
</p>
<p>
Leading up to surgery Dr. Brosious answered every question that myself and my family had. He was absolutely fantastic from the first moment I met him during my virtual consultation. I traveled to Las Vegas for preop appointment about a month before my surgery to meet him in person and again he was absolutely fantastic! Once it came to surgery day, he met me that morning with a giant smile. I was pre-op’d with lovely nurses, and wheeled back to the OR. Next thing I knew, I woke up in recovery and was able to see my family before heading to my private room.
</p>
<p>
I was in the hospital for a full seven days with a catheter and packing. I was encouraged to get up and walk the day after my surgery and I also worked with PT and OT every day of my stay. The nurses were all lovely and attended to my needs such as personal care and pain management very well. The pain was moderate because it was controlled well. By about the third day I switched from narcotics to Toradol. I was sent home with ibuprofen 800 as I did not require a narcotic upon discharge.
</p>
<p>
Every day I saw a resident and I even saw Dr. Brosious on several occasions during my hospital stay. For those who don’t know, it is not common to actually see the surgeon on a regular basis. You will typically just see an attending physician, but Dr. Brosious made it a point to stop by and visit me.
</p>
<p>
On discharge day, Dr. Brosious and his resident met me at 8 AM to introduce me to the dilation process. Not only was I supported by him and his resident, but also occupational therapy. They all did a fantastic job explaining the process and they did my first dilation before I was discharged. Dr. Brosious provided five dilators and instructed me to use numbers one through four and use the fourth one for a total of 20 minutes. After dilation, I was instructed to complete a vaginal douche of water and Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo. After dilation the occupational therapists were able to assist me with taking my first shower in a week. During the shower, I was able to pee with my new vagina and so I was eligible for discharge. Fortunately, everything went quickly and I was able to be home by lunchtime!
</p>
<p>
I’ll write another post about my recovery at home.

I was watching the videos on his website just last weekend.  He seems like a good guy.  Good luck with your recovery!

I just got out of surgery with Dr John pang from San Francisco Bay area. Everything went super well and amazing, everything&#39;s going beautifully and I love the results already.
</p>
<p>
Honestly the only problem I&#39;ve had so far is I haven&#39;t had a bowel movement yet.
