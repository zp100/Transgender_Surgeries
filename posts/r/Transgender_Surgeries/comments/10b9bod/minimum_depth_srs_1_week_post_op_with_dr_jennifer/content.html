Congratulations on your new vagina. Everything is going to feel hard/swollen after surgery. My clit was very sensitive to and annoying after my surgery, but things settled down. My lips where numb too, but they will regain some feeling in time. I had full depth and almost 2 yrs post-op and things work well down there. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

I‚Äôm about four and a half months after my minimum depth GCS. It definitely takes time. I‚Äôm a rule follower by nature so I didn‚Äôt try to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with anything until the doctor created me to around 2-2.5 months after. The swelling takes time. I was told around six months for it to fully resolve. It gets way better before then so don‚Äôt fret on that. I feel like I must be almost done with the swelling where I am now. I‚Äôd say my feeling is 80-90% back at this point. Everything has been fully functional since around the 3.5 month mark. I maybe could have been back sooner but again I‚Äôm cautious by nature.
</p>
<p>
I hope you have a great recovery and congratulations!!!

If you‚Äôre comfortable sharing, how was your experience working with Dr. Anger and UCSD? My partner is considering working with her since we are local but we are hesitant since we haven‚Äôt heard too much about her yet.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you a full and speedy recovery!

Thank you so much for sharing!!! I‚Äôm going to share your comment with my girlfriend so she can decide if she‚Äôd like a consultation.
</p>
<p>
I have my Phalloplasty in 6 months so we are figuring out scheduling so we both aren‚Äôt out of commission at the same time üòÖ It‚Äôs great to know that UCSD has a shorter waitlist, which means we can probably schedule further out.
</p>
<p>
I am going to follow you so we can stay connected to your journey. You‚Äôll be on our hearts and minds for a peaceful recovery. Thank you again for sharing ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï

You look incredible luv, Your a Warrior, and you are now Post Op for Vaginoplasty surgery too.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a major step for all of us Girls to go through.
</p>
<p>
When it&#39;s my turn to have it done I sure hope that there are strong enough painkillers for me to take, and of course for a speedy recovery too.
</p>
<p>
I am with you hun, all of us Girls are as well.
</p>
<p>
Will you have follow up care when you are at home?
</p>
<p>
I am looking into all of that now for me because I know I couldn&#39;t do it by myself.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re also very pretty hunny, and you give me strength to keep going in my Transition journey too.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the very best in your recovery time Sweetie pie.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve got your new vagina too, that&#39;s awesome.
</p>
<p>
Angela. xo.
