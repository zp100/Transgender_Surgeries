There shouldn&#39;t be a foul smell unless something is wrong like an infection or whatnot. Definitely talk to your surgeon&#39;s office ASAP for advice on what to do.

Hey OP, I had an issue from month 2-5 postop that first began presenting itself as a smell. It ultimately was Bacterial Vaginosis. It&#39;s very common. The signs are grey/green discharge and a &#34;fishy&#34; odor. Are you experiencing that?
</p>
<p>
No need to wash with soap. It will make your lady parts more basic which is more attractive to bacteria than acidic environments.
</p>
<p>
Use bulk saline solution that you can get off Amazon, or better yet, via a prescription from your doctor!

You absolutely can have a bacterial imbalance with minimal depth surgery. You need to begin antibiotic treatment ASAP.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ting&#39;s team put me on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
oral Metronidazole 250 mg tablet
</li>
<li>
Commonly known as: Flagyl
</li>
<li>
Take 3 tablets by mouth 3 times a day
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was given 15 tablets, so I was taking them *
<strong>
<em>
WITH FOOD
</em>
</strong>
* (very important) for a day and a half basically.
</p>
<p>
You will feel like trash for 3 days, and sluggish for the rest of the week. I&#39;m not going to sugarcoat this - This is one of the worst feeling antibiotics on the market. But in 1.5 days your BV will be killed.
</p>
<p>
Flush it out twice a day as you are now. Use the soapy water until your saline arrives. You can also get a prescription of bulk saline from your doctor. Your insurance might cover it!
</p>
<p>
Once the week of hell is over - it&#39;s SO important that you add probiotics back into your body. Drink plain kefir (or plain unsweetened yogurt with added probiotics), and a glass of kombucha *
<strong>
<em>
EVERY DAY FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN
</em>
</strong>
*. Just make it part of your daily routine.  I do kefir in the morning as part of breakfast, and kombucha at night. That way I&#39;m getting probiotics 2x a day. You want to establish good bacteria down there. Some vaginoplasty patients use probiotic suppository pills inside their vagina. I didn&#39;t, but totally feel free to do some research on that.

Sounds like a plan! Good luck. Don&#39;t freak out. It&#39;s normal and every woman will experience this at least once in her lifetime. Same with UTI&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
Consider it a badge of honor ❤️

Although I am ftm and this doesn’t apply to me on the account of I’m about to have top surgery in 10 days and bottom surgery in two months, I love this detailed response. A very good friend of mine is about to have the minimal depth surgery in literally 5 hours so this some good info to have in those just in case moments! So again, thank you for sharing your experience and the steps you took! It’s much appreciated!!

I&#39;ve never heard of this. Generally a foul odor is a sign of an infection, or something else not right. You may want to talk to your doctor about it.

Ok, I’ll contact them in the morning.  Maybe I’ll try using the antibiotic ointment again tonight, too.

See any doctor asap.  Probably an infection.
</p>
<p>
Washing the outside with lightly soaped water is ok, never the inside.  Bc we lack mucosa, my doctor recommends a slightly acidic douche 1-2x week.  It helps prevent infections and remove dead skin.
