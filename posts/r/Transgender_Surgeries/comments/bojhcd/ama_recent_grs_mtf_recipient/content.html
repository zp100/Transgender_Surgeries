Per the title; I underwent GRS (Penile Inversion Vagioplasty) about a week ago and I can answer questions if you have any while the experience is fresh in my memory. Questions may relate to:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pre-op
</p>
<p>
Expenses
</p>
<p>
Post-op care
</p>
<p>
How to care for yourself and the neo-vagina during the first few weeks
</p>
<p>
What to expect
</p>
<p>
etc
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If I could help in any way by sharing my experience for you to make an informed decision, I’m happy to do so. I’ll take all questions seriously and will answer them best I can.
</p>
<p>
Fellow souls, please keep in mind that I had been living in stealth for years and haven’t really been a part of these subs or the community as a whole; as I identify as a girl and not as trans. So pardon any improper etiquette as I’ve only come here to share my experience for someone else’s benefit if they had any questions, kindly do not assign my mis speaking (if any) as malice when it might be just ignorance, for which I apologize, and hence the throw away account.
</p>

I prepared some questions earlier, if you&#39;d like to answer any of those.

Did you have any nervousness/fears/anxiety the weeks leading up to surgery? How did you deal with it if you did?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m less than a month away from my surgery date and I&#39;m honestly getting scared

Take your time. You can’t rush this. You don’t want to. Trust me. Be 100% sure of your own want. Take a sec if you need to for self reflection. The surgery takes a toll on you. The recovery is way harder than the surgery. I had an actual surgeon living with me in my house and it was still difficult to deal with. Have a very strong support system and make sure to have everything that you could possibly need be available as this will be the most vulnerable time of your life.
</p>
<p>
Complications occur. I had / have a fistula. I underwent a follow up surgery. Be ready financially for such things to occur.
</p>
<p>
Scared? Me? No I wasn’t. I should’ve been though. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not regretting the surgery, I’m just upset by how disruptive it’s been for my body and the recovery is hard and I’m missing work (yeah I actually like work m a boring person). I should’ve been better prepared. I wasn’t. No one ever can be. So just have a good support system, you can’t do this alone.
</p>
<p>
I paid a pretty penny and was expecting things to go smoothly. They didn’t. But I’m hopeful and soon enough things should sort out. I’ll come back here a few days / weeks later to report on all the complications.

Who did I go with?
</p>
<p>
Bayshore Plastic Surgery, Tampa, FL
</p>
<p>
Dr. Daniel Greenwald.
</p>
<p>
He’s been working with the community for like 30 years or something and doesn’t advertise. But people in the industry know him AFAIK based on my conversations with other people in the industry.
</p>
<p>
His practice only attracts a certain kinda crowd tho, so that’s another reason why it is the way it is. I wanted it to be discreet and discreet it was. I guess you get what you pay for and he’s been pretty worth the high price tag thus far.
</p>
<p>
Going in for my second post op follow up today. First follow up was rather ... quick (I’m hesitant to say rushed because it wasn’t, he didn’t have time for unnecessary interaction and as a busy profesional i get that too. Just one of those days I suppose, I’ll know more today)
</p>
<p>
As for the procedure and outcome, I won’t be posting any pics (privacy is very important to me I can’t be outed) but the results thus far look VERY natural. Functionally, don’t know yet, let’s see.

May I ask what you mean by &#34;a certain kind of crowd?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Do you think Dr Greenwald would be hesitant to work with a non-passing trans woman, or care less about the results of the surgery?
</p>
<p>
About how much did it cost (if you don&#39;t mind sharing that)?

I’d hold off a tiny bit on going to him. I’ll keep posting about updates when able. Overall - it looks fine (as good as it can be only this far out from the surgery) I have full sensation and my clit works. Also good. Got a fistula which had been horrible. It made me want to die. Had a follow up surgery. Waiting for follow up from my fistula surgery and I’ll see how it goes. I’d suggest wait to hear my final results before booking.
</p>
<p>
A certain kind of crowd - financially.
</p>
<p>
Cost - Surgeon $25k Surgery Center $1750 or something. Complications - still counting. I paid everything with a check. Ie cash in bank. Not super happy about complications.
