My main goal going into surgery was to come out looking like myself! I had a scalp advancement, brow shave, brow lift, type 3 forehead reconstruction, Botox into my jaw muscle, buccal fat pad removal, osterioplasty and a jaw shave! Initially I wanted to wait until like 3 months post op to share, but everything has gone so smoothly I figured why not share my progress :) overall I‚Äôm really happy! Also I went to the dentist today and told her about my surgeries and she called me fabulous so I‚Äôm extra feeling my oats. I can‚Äôt wait to see what my chin/jaw look like in a month or so. I don‚Äôt have any future plans for surgery, aside from a breast augmentation scheduled in March, but I really wanna go to South Korea to get my nose done, just for fun, and maybe get filler in my bottom lip.

Did you do the jaw botox as a 1 time thing, or are you going to get more of them?
</p>
<p>
I had it done 2 times- once before, once after my FFS. Same issues here with clenching and stuff!! They are awfully expensive though, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll keep getting them or not.

I‚Äôm not against getting it again! I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be as painless lol... I kind of like having a masculine jaw though, I think it‚Äôs more high fashion I‚Äôm definitely wondering if I‚Äôll need more though

Pretty massive difference.  I think it looks great.
</p>
<p>
About the Botox, did you get it to reduce your jaw muscles? I was thinking about doing that since I think I have TMJ and my jaw is a bit bigger than it should be.  Is that why you did, and did it help?

Yes!! I clench my jaw as an anxious tick, so my jaw muscles were MASSIVE. They‚Äôve definitely decreased in notably, I could barely feel them during the first couple days. They‚Äôre coming back a little now, although I‚Äôm not sure if they are or I‚Äôm just paranoid. Sometimes I wake up and still think my right eye is a little saggy, since that‚Äôs what my brow lift fixed. Thank you :)!
