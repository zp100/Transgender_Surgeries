Hey friends. Shamelessly reposting this from
<a href="/r/Ask_Transgender" rel="nofollow">r/Ask_Transgender
</a>
. So I&#39;m trying to decide on a surgeon for SRS and my endo suggested to me these two surgeons that she recommends. I was just curious to hear if anyone here has had their SRS done with either of these surgeons and how the general consult, procedure, aftercare, and healing processes went. I also can&#39;t find any images or results when looking for Dr. Jess Ting&#39;s portfolio.

You can look through my posts and it describes the healing process.
</p>
<p>
I really liked Dr. Ting and the results that I got. I can PM you photos if you want. :) I just don&#39;t want them re-posted by terrible people so I removed the links.

Thank you! Also it&#39;s up to you if you feel comfortable dming me photos, I don&#39;t want to be too invasive. i am very interested in seeing what results are like with Ting.
</p>
<p>
Also, you made a post about having to do electrolysis prior to SRS, how was that and about how many sessions did you have to do? I only had electro done elsewhere and the thought of having to do that down there is kind of unnerving lol.

It got easier, hahah.
</p>
<p>
The first session was awful. I had never had to take off my pants and underwear for basically someone I just met who was not a doctor. The pain was really bad too.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend getting prescription-level lidocaine cream from a doctor or find someone who does lidocaine injections. I am not sure about the injections though, they were horrendously painful in my face, I can&#39;t imagine how bad it would be down there.
</p>
<p>
In terms of how many sessions, I believe I did 8 or 9. I started going every week, just to get it done because I realized I was running behind.
</p>
<p>
Ting does follicle scraping but prefers you get as much done as possible to reduce the time it takes during surgery.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
As the sessions went on and I got prescription lidocaine, it became easier. The technician was really nice and we would just chat about vacations or whatever. Near the end I started listening to podcasts to keep my mind off it so she could get more work done.

For my  first genital electrolysis session, I went to Dr. Mark Zukowski&#39;s clinic  near Chicago.  They administer IV &#34;twilight sleep&#34; and shoot you up with lidocaine.  the &#34;twilight sleep&#34; was a good high, but I was completely aware of those injections going in my genitals. Oh. My. God. It really hurt.  However, I got a complete clearing done in a little over 4 hours, without pain.  It should mention it was very expensive, abut $1000, not including travel.
</p>
<p>
Realizing this was not financially practical, I did what another poster recommended and got some prescription-strength local anesthetic (EMLA cream) and lathered up the area an hour before my session. I would cover it in plastic wrap so it didn&#39;t get all over my clothes, and head off to my session.  It worked fabulously. Almost no pain at all for laser or electrolysis. A whole lot cheaper, too.
</p>
<p>
I did six or seven clearings, I think, with the last one mostly a touch-up to go after any remaining hairs.
</p>
<p>
I went to Dr. McGinn, BTW, and her consultations are fairly straightforward.  She can be  a bit brusque, but as I got to know her over the next year, my relationship with her improved.  As fas as the procedure itself, it&#39;s also similar to most: three days in the hospital, and 10 days of aftercare.  Dr. McGinn is not a hand-holder.  She is an ex-Navy surgeon, and it tends to show.  Dr. McGinn owns a wonderful B&amp;B in New Hope, and staying there for recovery was a wonderful experience. I did have some complications afterward, but 2 1/2 years later I have been told the aesthetics are very good. In fact, two friends of mine elected to go with McGinn after seeing my results.  I would recommend her.

There’s ways of doing those injections so they don’t hurt much, but lots of doctors don’t bother.

Heyy, I&#39;m so happy for you for getting surgery with dr. Ting! I&#39;ve already emailed him asking for pics to get an idea of how it would look like but I&#39;m pretty sure he won&#39;t send any. Also I live in italy so it would cost a lot just to get there to ask for a consultation just to see the results. If you don&#39;t mind it would be so helpful if you could dm me the result, if not I completely understand :). Have a nice day!

I had GCS with McGinn 8 months ago. DM me with any questions. Short story - 10/10 would recommend.

Those apps make you miss a lot on this sub, and about half the people here use them
