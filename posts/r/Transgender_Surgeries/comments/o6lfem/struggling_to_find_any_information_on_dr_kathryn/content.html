I just recently had a consultation with Dr. Brandt and while the conversation was amicable, as the title says I couldn&#39;t and still can&#39;t find any information regarding her results or a review, not even who she studied under. She&#39;s not listed at all in the Trans wiki so I&#39;m not sure what other resource I can use to find out to make a properly informed decision.
</p>
<p>
My only other reasonable option due to location seems to be Dr. Rumer and I have been
<strong>
<em>
strongly
</em>
</strong>
advised to steer clear of her. I&#39;m not exactly sure what to do now, and any help would be appreciated.

Dr.  Brandt was working with Kathy Rumer in a fellowship role.   Dr. Brandt was in the room when Rumer and I got into a screaming match.   Dr.  Brandt sweetly apologized for Rumer.   Rumer the asshole said nothing but threaten my care six months later.
</p>
<p>
Dr.  Brandt is very sweet and kind and I’d give her a chance.    Stay away from Kathy Rumer.
</p>
<p>
My PCP said one of patients went to Rumer for an orchi and Kathy screwed that up too.

Yup.   My PCP is mad she bit her tongue.  She wanted to discourage her from going to Kathy but hesitated.  Good job Kathy.  You pissed off yet another doctor who thinks you work and staff are shit.  (You know she’s so damn narcissistic she’s reading this.   Hi Kathy.  Fuck you. )

I dismissed her and she threatened my care because I wrote a review detailing my experience

That was my impression of Dr. Brandt as well, and if she working with Kathy Rumer I&#39;m guessing they use similar techniques?

It’s not the technique that’s in question.  Even Dr. Ting said when examining me how Kathy has improved her technique.  If Dr. Brandt uses a similar method and unlike Kathy is competent you will be okay.

If she doesn’t do my revision I’ll have an ob/gyn so it’ll work out for me since she’s 5min from my door.

Just scheduled an appointment with Dr. Brandt.  The nurse who works with Dr. Brandt is totally awesome.   And they have ZERO love for Kathy.

The fellowship was through the hospital so technically she wasn’t working with Rumer she was working with the hospital.  I have no other idea who the other surgeons were.  Dr. Brandt’s coordinator knows all the Rumer stories and I could tell there is zero love and respect for the hag.

When a surgeon can’t show you their own results or tell you how many surgeries they have done on their own that is a bad sign. Trust me, I have family in the medical community.
</p>
<p>
Make the trip to see Dr. Cecile Ferrando at the Cleveland Clinic. My cousin had her orchi and then vaginoplasty by her and it is beautiful. She is so happy and she is two years out from her surgery. I met her during the after surgery part. She is the nicest doctor I have ever met.

Dr. Christine McGinn is located very close to Rumer, so you might want to check her out, she seems great :)
</p>
<p>
That said, SRS is not, in my opinion, a surgery that should be done with a surgeon because the location is convenient. Location may be a factor, but it should not be a reason to choose an unknown surgeon. Doing so could be very risky and could leave you with a lot of regret. I&#39;d also say that from my own experience, location becomes a lot less important once you decide on a surgeon for other reasons. For me, traveling across the world seemed far less daunting once I actually decided to do it (although your situation might be different, in which case I&#39;d urge you to look at McGinn). Good luck!

McGinn is impossible. I&#39;m on medicaid and cannot pay up front whatsoever since she does not accept insurance. Location is important because I do not have the money or ability to stay in the area far from where I am for follow up if they are too far away.

Dr. Brandt was actually suggested to me by my psychiatrist, who also warned me about Kathy Rumer (there&#39;s been like 10+ people who keep saying this so I&#39;m taking it at face value now). Wouldn&#39;t have known about her otherwise.

I would go to Dr. Sherman Leis before Rumer.  He is in Philly Mainline.

I think some insurances can give you a &#34;proof they will cover the cost&#34; or something, which you can use to get a short term loan at a bank, although obviously be careful with that. McGinn can be covered by insurance, but you&#39;ll need to pay upfront and be reimbursed.
</p>
<p>
I hope someone will provide you with more insight. If I were you, I would ask the new surgeon very tough questions on exactly what her qualifications are and how she was trained. Unfortunately we see far too many girls in this sub who got unacceptable results from surgeons that were their only option. SRS is not a standardized procedure, and the quality will vary greatly depending on who performs it. I hope you&#39;re able to get insurance coverage for a surgeon with a long and positive track record. You&#39;re definitely not being put in an easy position.

You can’t make an informed decision, not even if you found a few reviews. It’s hard enough when there’s lots of reviews. However there’s no way she has much experience and that does tend to be associated with a higher rate of complications.
</p>
<p>
There’s plenty in the wiki on Kathy Rumer so you can make an informed decision there.
