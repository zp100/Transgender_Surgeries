I thought I would share a bit about my experience with having PI with Dr. Brassard now that I healed enough to give it a fair assessment.
</p>
<p>
The surgery itself went really good I&#39;m told, no complications other than waking up twice but the very cute anaesthesiologist had me back under right away. Waking up after my surgery I remember being extremely cold and they had me wrapped in like 5 blankets but I was still shivering. I slept off and on most of the afternoon but was up and walking by that evening with moderate levels of pain.
</p>
<p>
The next week was pretty boring, just sat around and watched Netflix inbetween dilations, showers and sitz baths. This routine would continue at home for about a month as well. The flight home wasn&#39;t much fun though and I ended up with a couple split stitches at the top of my vulva. They healed quick enough but left a bit of scar tissue that still hasn&#39;t faded.
</p>
<p>
Healing in general seemed to go well other than the split stitches. My vagina is now fairly cute and natural looking, my clit and labia minora are on the smaller side but very cute and VERY sensitive. I ended up with about 5.5-6in of depth though tbh find I much prefer clitoral stimulation to penetration anyway so haven&#39;t used that for much.
</p>
<p>
I still dilate every day with the orange dilator, I stopped using the blue one two months in cause I found it was a waste of time and lube when I could just insert the orange dilator slower with similar results. I have no pain when dilating and haven&#39;t since about 4 weeks after my surgery.
</p>
<p>
Orgasming seems extremely easy now. Before I was so dysphoric it took quite a while to get in the headspace but now like 30 seconds of playing with my clit and I&#39;m there. I found out I&#39;m a bit of a squirter so tbh the orgasms feel kinda similar I&#39;m that regard but I also get hot waves up my body a lot more intense than I did before. I figured out how to orgasm really soon too, I think I had my first one at 3 weeks post op though was very careful and mostly just used my Kegel muscles.
</p>
<p>
Self lubrication seems to vary from day to day. Some days like today I soak through my underwear I&#39;m so wet and for seemingly no reason and other days I can be horny as all hell and have to use lube. I always get extremely wet after an orgasm though so sometimes I just masturbate before dilating to save on lube.
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m very happy with my results and feel like a new person since my surgery. I didn&#39;t even realize how constantly irritated I was having the wrong parts for so long and how much it affected other aspects of my life. Basically I was a miserable B most of the time but now I feel more relaxed and comfortable than I ever have in my life.

I saw Brassard about four months ago. Curious if you still douche? I&#39;ve tried stopping to see how it goes.

I stopped douching around the 3 month mark. No adverse affects so far, if anything things have gotten better. I found I had a bit of a wet dog smell sometimes when I was still douching but since I stopped and my vaginal flora has had time to develop it smells a lot less and much more like the cis vaginas I&#39;ve been up close and personal with. I find my natural lubrication is a lot more effective too now that it&#39;s not being rinsed away after every dilation.

I stopped douching about three or four weeks ago, so that would be around the same point that you did. I haven&#39;t noticed any adverse effects. Sometimes my smell has been a little stronger than I want it to be, so I&#39;ve tried using boric acid suppositories (used to treat BV and yeast) to see if that naturally acidifies the environment and makes for more pleasant flora. Results of this little experiment are pending.

Hello! First off, happy to hear that everything is going great :)
</p>
<p>
I was under the impression that you needed to douche everytime after a dilatation (switching to tap water after a while). Was I misunderstood? I am 3 months post-op with Brassard and wondering if it is common.

Most other surgeons recommend stopping once your healed to let a natural vaginal flora develop. It&#39;s said to be unhealthy for cis women to douche on a regular basis and even Brassard didn&#39;t recommend douching long term until recently and will probably change his mind again because pretty much every girl I&#39;ve talked to that&#39;s been to him has stopped eventually with no adverse affects.

Oh, okay! I am still going to douche because I have still have a bunch of vaginal loss (due to hypergranulation), but will definitively give it a go once it&#39;s healed. When did you feel &#34;safe&#34; to stop doing it? (I feel that it&#39;s hard to tell when everything is good to go since you can&#39;t really see the inside of the vaginal cavity)

Things inside should heal faster than the outside so I felt comfortable once my visible incisions were completely healed.

Hey! Another question for you - how do you tell you&#39;re at depth? When you are, do you keep exerting pressure, as if stretching the bottom of the vagina - and if you do, does it hurt / is it uncomfortable?
</p>
<p>
Basically I&#39;m trying to determine if discomfort I feel is from like loosening up a tight vagina, or if I&#39;m actually pressing too hard against the bottom.

All I can say is.... HOLY SHIT! wow... couldn&#39;t even get there that fast in pre-HRT &#34;rabbit&#34; boy-mode. Impressive! If I may ask, has it just sped up for you? Or were you always able to orgasm that quickly?
</p>
<p>
Random question though...I&#39;m going to Brassard too - how long after until you are allowed to have any form of sex? Masturbation or otherwise? You said you orgasmed 3 weeks after, but like did you have to &#34;re-learn&#34; how to orgasm?

I was definitely never that fast before and actually only had about a 50% success rate orgasming before I had GRS. Masturbating especially I would get way too dysphoric to finish most of the time and just give up. My new equipment is much more comfortable and fun to use.
</p>
<p>
I was told to wait 3 months before masturbating or having sex but I couldn&#39;t wait that long. I was so horned up by the 3 week mark that I spent hours initially trying to figure out a way to masturbate without pulling on my stitches and figured out I could if I squeezed my Kegel muscles on the dilator. Takes a lot longer than just playing with my clit but it got me through the recovery period well enough.
</p>
<p>
Other than that I wouldn&#39;t say I had to re-learn how to orgasm though. It all came to me pretty naturally but like I said I had a hard time using my natal equipment so in comparison it&#39;s just way easier and more comfortable.

Wow, that actually... fucking sucks tbh. I never really had that, as long as stuff didn&#39;t bop against anything if that makes sense? I actually have always had complete aversion to actual sex with others (which now makes a shit ton more sense now), but masturbation was never a problem for me thank god. I could only find interest in kink though before HRT kicked in, since no contact (long story). I really
<em>
really
</em>
fucking hate noticing my testicles....So I know how dyspohoria fucks with that - I guess I was luckier then. Just kept my head (not a pun, my literal brain haha) elsewhere and not pay attention if that makes any sense? Since transition, despite being pre-op, finally found some sexual interest with others (chest play and stuff etc), and obviously has nothing to do with downstairs... XD I still haven&#39;t figured out a way that doesn&#39;t feel like shit, so hopefully post will make that go away...and again, I&#39;m pretty sure that would explain some of the incongruent thoughts lol. It&#39;s weird for me because I was like...doing stuff in my life and the more I think about it, the more I realize that everything I ever did or didn&#39;t do was driven by dysphoria without knowing it. Hmmm.... But you had it way rougher in my opinion. :( Like, my god... I was an uncontrollable rabbit before HRT kicked in. So happy it did finally crush that though.

<p>
Like, other than dysphoria, hopefully this isn&#39;t a weird question but anatomically is there some advantage that maybe is responsible for the &#34;quickness&#34; of it? Like is the G-spot closer inside? I love that you are so much more comfortable though, and thank you for enduring my questions. I&#39;m far enough out, but getting orchi soon, then SRS as soon as they let me, which could be a while...

I don&#39;t think it has as much to do with my physical anatomy as much as the mental aspect of things. If I&#39;m not in the mood I definitely can&#39;t get there that fast but when I am I a straight up perv. I get off so easy even just watching someone else have an orgasm usually makes me have one too.

O.O Omg, I wish I could do that! Even prior to HRT if there wasn&#39;t active effort involved, I would never be able to get off in the slightest. I didn&#39;t think that was a real thing... &gt;.&lt; wow!

The most common vaginoplasty technique is a
<strong>
Penile Inversion
</strong>
procedure. In this technique,
<strong>
penile
</strong>
skin is used to construct the vaginal lining. The labia majora are created using scrotal skin, and the clitoris is built from the sensitive skin at the tip of the penis.

Penile inversion. And you can find the website for his clinic by looking up GRS Montreal on Google.

I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s gone well for you. I&#39;ve been questioning lately if I had the courage to go through with GRS, but I&#39;m really glad there&#39;s positive stories like yours out there. I really hope the rest of your recovery goes smoothly for you!

Thank you for sharing! I&#39;m on the list for Montreal and I am very nervous. This gives me hope that mine will turn out well.
