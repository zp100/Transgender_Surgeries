He’s a friend of Dr. Thomas, a laryngologist who operates on about 200 larynxes a year (if I remember correctly), and is experienced doing the procedure. His method is pretty much identical to Dr. Thomas (including the bit where you raise the voice box up the throat) but for me with the added benefit of being in Australia which is just so much appealing in so many ways. Cheaper too. He also performs the wendler glottoplasty (and has done more of those than femlars) but I really liked the idea of Femlar so I went for that.
</p>
<p>
The cost overall (before any Medicare and private health insurance rebates): A bit less than 10k AUD (7k USD). This includes my flight from Melbourne. I have family in Brissie so that makes things easy.
</p>
<p>
I liked his demeanour and he explained everything to my satisfaction plus the one complication he’s had (he’s done 10 femlar surgeries), so I booked. I’m 26 so the chance for a nice outcome is very high in my case, and I healed very quickly from FFS so there’s that too.
</p>
<p>
Surgery is booked for mid Feb. Hoping to post back here with my results, especially for you Aussie ladies.

His method is identical to dr thomas’ so that’s a yes to the elevation and trach shave (not a trach shave, but the procedure by its nature aggressively reduces the adam’s apple).
</p>
<p>
I did not think to ask for audio samples, my questions were mainly about probing for how safe he feels the procedure is and how comfortable he seemed to be doing it, as well as how happy he was with his results. Also whether his method diverged from Dr. Thomas: the only difference is he cuts 1/3 of the vocal chord instead of 40%. He says all his patients have gotten ‘at least’ 180hz, usually 200 and sometimes even higher.
</p>
<p>
I went to see him in late November and was offered dates starting from mid Feb so not much of a waiting list at all.

It’s reassuring in the context that Dr. Broadhurst mainly operates on larynxes and his job is usually to fix up larynxes that have been damaged by disease, accidents, or cogenital defects. If you watch the youtube video of a femlar surgery being performed it’s not particularly complex, they open up the larynx, remove some of the cartilage to narrow it up, make sure that the insicions to shorten the chords are perfectly aligned, then cut, reattach, seal everything back up, then raise the box with a suture. The hardest part according to both Dr. Broadhurst and Dr. Thomas is making sure you get those vocal chords perfectly aligned and equally tensioned. This was also his complication, in his words he didn’t get the chords ‘perfect’ and thus had to repair his work. There was another complication where one of his patients went to a laryngologist in Melbourne to get extra laser tightening a few weeks after surgery without consulting Dr. Broadhurst. The laser melted the sutures and the vocal chords (or was it just one?) detached. So obviously don’t do that. :P
</p>
<p>
Apparently as you age the laryngeal cartilage ossifies and gets tough to work on, but I’m 26 and started hormones at 21 and I expect (and have been told as much by various voice people) that my larynx is soft and easy to work on, and I’ll heal well and quickly. Dr. Thomas is also amazing in that he posts quite extensively about his method, including the gory details, complications and how to fix them, the challenges of the surgery (ossified larynx, aligning everything, and then patient’s healing not messing it up), and other little details, like revisions and laser tuning when things go wrong. So armed with this information I was satisfied that if Dr. Broadhurst is my surgeon I wouldn’t really be missing out on anything over going to Dr. Thomas and I could be gaining lots by doing it here in Australia. For instance, if there is a serious complication (infection), good luck getting hospitalised in the US and paying for that, because Dr. Thomas doesn’t get insurance and expects his patients to have it. And while I have no direct experience with this I have heard horror stories of patients being 10k USD out of pocket for broken bones even with insurance. No thanks if I can avoid it.
</p>
<p>
I think if you’re old it makes sense to go to Dr. Thomas because he’s more experienced dealing with harder to work on larynxes and the more unpredictable healing, but if you’re young and with an experienced laryngeal surgeon who’s done it 10 times before I can’t see what the difference really is. The method is the same. The doctors have the same training, and both mainly work on repairing cis people’s broken larynxes.
</p>
<p>
It’s scary, but ‘fucking up your voice’ is a risk you’ll take with any surgeon. Yeson, Thomas, and the rest of them all have results (Dr. Thomas even put them on his website himself because he tries to be super honest) that are honestly pretty awful. I’ve also noticed the bad results tend to go up with age so I’d say a terrible outcome is a risk you have to make your peace with, esp. if you’re older. The risk is there if you’re young too. I don’t think this is so much dependent on the surgeon but rather depending on how people heal and also the nature of their voicebox going in. The risk is always there.
</p>
<p>
That’s the thought process that led me to booking with Dr. Broadhurst. Ultimately I’m starting to feel a bit like a salesperson so I’d say if you’re still curious go talk to him yourself, but I hope this helped! :)
</p>
<p>
EDIT: oh yeah, the way Dr. Broadhurst learnt to do the surgery is because he was Dr. Thomas’ friend, watched him do it a bunch of times, the whole 9 yards. He didn’t suddenly decide to do Femlar one day with zero idea of how to do it. So I think ‘the skills’ to do it well are definitely there with Dr. Broadhurst.

3 weeks to start talking, months to heal up properly, a year to be fully done. Your voice will progressively gain strength and quality and at first you’ll tire quickly and sound like shit but things improve as you heal. It’s important to take it easy.
</p>
<p>
I forgot to ask about the general anaesthesia unfortunately (felt silly when I realised a few hours after walking out lol!) but Dr. Thomas says on his website that if you need to be intubated before 3 months after surgery have elapsed to use a small tube, he lists the size on his website. I’d expect Dr. Broadhurst to recommend the same. But I do need to ask as after this, way down the line I’m hoping to finish off with SRS.
</p>
<p>
I had FFS in November and just a tip the intubation
<em>
does
</em>
mess with your voice and the anaesthesia
<em>
will
</em>
make you weak and you’ll honestly feel like shit. I would strongly suggest waiting at least 6 months, even a year before doing more trans surgery simply because I found it hard enough to communicate with a healthy voice, the prospect of trying to communicate with a weakened voice box after major surgery like FFS is p. terrifying.

For what it&#39;s worth, I had FFS at the end of March, VFS with Dr Thomas in the middle of June, and GRS at the end of November.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t vouch for what going under at 3 months vs 5 months post op might have done in terms of VFS results, but I think my voice was recovered well enough by that point to communicate effectively.

Hi! I&#39;m hesitating between going to Dr Thomas and Dr Broadhurst. They both have advantages and disadvantages so I&#39;m gonna choose according to their revision policy. Do you know if Dr Broadhurst can do a laser revision on your cords or will you have to go to Dr Thomas? I&#39;m gonna ask their office but depending on whose secretary is responding, they give me a different response to the same question so that&#39;s why I&#39;m bothering you. sorry!

If I remember correctly, Dr. Broadhurst can do the laser tuneups, yes. :) You need to wait a while for the chords to heal though.
</p>
<p>
You’re best served by booking an appointment with him and seeing him directly, he’s great and will answer all your questions. Of course with COVID who knows when that will be. :’(

Thanks for your quick response!!! &#34;You&#39;re best served by booking an appointement with him and seeing him directly&#34; I really want to but because I live far away I need to make my definitve choice. Yeah covid reallt sucks for trans folks who had surgeries planned. I wont be able to have my bottom surgery this summer because of it so Im hoping Dr broadhurst works this july/august to replace it.

I live in Melbourne so I flew down to see him. Unless you’re overseas - and maybe then you could surely arrange a phone/Skype meet, I’d highly recommend having a chat with him first.

Did you reached out to Dr Broadhurst office by email or phone? I reached out by email asking questions about a month ago then made my decision to book an appointment/consultation. We&#39;ll that was roughly a month ago when the virus hit Australia and I haven&#39;t heard anything back. Before that the office was responsive through email. I&#39;m in the US so it isn&#39;t easy to call their office. I will call their office in June-ish and try scheduling a consult again.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any luck scheduling. The contact also told me you can do the consult/endoscopy a week before surgery.
