NOTE: I will be asking my surgeon about this but I don&#39;t see him for a couple days.
</p>
<p>
Also: I had zero-depth / cosmetic SRS. And I stopped taking spiro about 9 months ago. I&#39;ve just been on estradiol injections ever since.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been 10+ days since my SRS. Yesterday morning and this morning, I experienced something startling. Essentially, it felt like I had &#34;morning wood&#34;. One of the things that really surprised me since SRS is that it feels like all my old parts are still down there (except the lingering ache in my balls is gone). Sometimes it feels like I just gave myself a bad / too tight tuck. That&#39;s not so surprising because the same nerves are down there and they spent 52 years getting used to the old bits. It might take some time for my brain to adjust.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;morning wood&#34; sensation was mostly a sensation. TBH, I was afraid to look too closely and have been pre-occupied with the healing of my face and neck.  I had a little more bleeding from the stitches this morning. But it&#39;s stopped now.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else experienced this? If you have first-hand experience, should I alert my surgeon sooner rather than later?

Hi, yep this is normal. I had a regular penile inversion vaginoplasty, and wake up with what I&#39;d consider the same feeling of morning wood. Except I look down and it&#39;s just my clit that&#39;s aching.
</p>
<p>
Surgeons leave a bit of erectile tissue inside of you so that you know when you&#39;re becoming aroused.
</p>
<p>
However sometimes there is too much left, so after 3 months assess the situation and determine if you are having painful arousal.
</p>
<p>
That being said, it&#39;s too early to tell what&#39;s happening down there so soon after your surgery, so don&#39;t think too much of it. Although, it&#39;s very cool that you&#39;ve had erogenous sensation so early on. This is excellent news. Definitely keep your surgeon aware of your recovery progress.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with recovery.

I am also 52 and I had zero depth 4 weeks ago.  I know exactly what you mean.  Its part of the healing process and seems to be lessening as the swelling goes down.  Feel free to dm me

After my surgery I felt like I was walking around with a constant boner for weeks.  It was so strange.
