I was pretty worried re what I would find given how swollen I was, and how much I bled overnight but having gotten another look and a wee cleanup, it&#39;s far better than I expected. I suspect most of the blood was early in the night. I believe that some of the swelling around the stitches that were obviously being pulled at in my last night pix has abated. Sink wash of upper body fresh everything and feeling a bit more human/hopeful again. I have had an easy ride so far and I would love this to continue! Still no pain, remaining BOURG bits come off tomorrow and hopefully I can dilate. Oh and I bloody love my new front view even with the swelling!

Wow that&#39;s an improvement over yesterday !
</p>
<p>
Looks a lot less angry today :)
</p>
<p>
Not sure if it&#39;s bothering you but I found sticking the the catheter tube to my belly stopped it pulling on my bladder and was much more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the updates, it&#39;s really interesting :)

I dunna wanna bore folks to death with my updates, but was pretty worried it was all going to unravel last night! I&#39;ve just been tucking the fat part of tube under waistband. Seems to work OK.

Yes she is looking and feeling better, TR has been a good choice. I have still not even seen BR, maybe cause I am on the 1st floor? On that front, I am moving rooms today to 2nd floor, as they are closing this floor bit of a pain as I have stuff like everywhere!! Hopefully more trans patients up there so so that&#39;s good. Just found out it&#39;s because of the queen&#39;s funeral and less staff being available they are closing this floor cause there&#39;s only 3 patients left on it.

That makes sense, doesn’t sound like it’s something that happens often!
</p>
<p>
You’re seriously doubling down on my TR choice though :)
