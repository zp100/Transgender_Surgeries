Hello all! I finally have been getting the energy to start doing some things to keep myself more occupied in the hospital. I was planning on doing a post about my journey for everything so far from honestly conception of wanting bottom surgery to currently being on day 1 of my surgery and getting ready to walk around tomorrow and see my new coochie. Some things Iâ€™ll be talking about and/or describing might be a little NSFW so warning for some people. But now to begin.
</p>
<p>
When I first conceived wanting bottom surgery:
</p>
<p>
I remember one night not too long after starting hormones when I was using the bathroom that I looked down and some strange feeling took over. I remember a slight ringing in my ear and feeling nauseous looking down at my girlcock and realizing that it might have been dysphoria. I told myself to not instantly jump on that being the reason and tried shrugging it off. That was until I started wearing more gender affirming clothes since things started popping off pretty early for me with breast growth and body fat redistribution. I remember trying on leggings or form fitting clothes and being genuinely frustrated about my bulge to the point where I would give up and just put on something baggy. I noticed that on top of using the bathroom occasionally just kept getting to me to the point where I knew for sure it had to be bottom dysphoria. Thatâ€™s when I started trying to find ways to relieve it in some form because at the time I felt like it would be hard to do bottom surgery. The one percent for trans girls. Until I started noticing the workarounds I found only gave temporary relief and that I needed to eventually find something permanent. And then the bottom surgery journey began.
</p>
<p>
The quest for getting bottom surgery:
</p>
<p>
Not too long after realizing that bottom surgery was the answer I had got my current job that had insurance that made things possible for me to start looking. After a quick peek at what my insurance does for it I started looking for surgeons. I did research on every one I could find and looked at review after review from this subreddit to online to discords with fellow trans girls who got bottom surgery. Thatâ€™s when I started to narrow down on surgeons. I knew certain ones had a BMI limit and since I am a thicker girl I knew it would be a LOT of work to even get to the LIMIT for some surgeons. I was 215 at the time and knew with my body shape I needed a surgeon who had more experience with people my shape and size. So I started narrowing things down which eventually lead to a few surgeons. So I hoped on getting my letters. The first one I was able to obtain from my NP for hormones. Then came the second one. I knew I already needed to get back into therapy because of past trauma and issues I was having currently with life. So I used my insurance and started looking. Once I found one and got in a few appointments I learned a lot more about myself, being disgnosed with BPD and ADHD hit me like a brick wall. But it made me realize how my brain worked and how to try and overcome those diagnoses. But thatâ€™s also when I was able to obtain my second letter. Then thatâ€™s when I sent in inquiries for appointments left and right finding who was the right fit. Some responded quick and some took forever but finally got to me. I booked consultations for them all and managed to only really get one relatively quick and that was Dr. Praful Remineni. I booked the consultation and had it booked for July 17th.
</p>
<p>
The consultation:
</p>
<p>
Overall his consultation and the information he gave was super informative, so much to the point where the billions of questions I felt I had for him he hit right on the nail without me even asking and that gave me full confidence. After the consultation not even an hour later I got some available dates and chose the latest one; October 25th, 2023. I remember literally dancing with my girlfriend with joy realizing how close I was to getting the right body finally.
</p>
<p>
Insurance and getting everything squared away for the surgery:
</p>
<p>
Once I got the surgery booked I started getting everything lined up for the big date. I started getting FMLA and Short Term Disability completed with my work. I printed almost three booklets worth of information for it highlighting any information I needed to make sure things went smooth. I got it all set up and finally was able to just play the waiting game. Then around September was when I was contacted by Ramineni about how insurance was going. My provider is Anthem BCBS and they were pretty straightforward. All they needed was the two letters that I sent to Ramineni and though their decision for coverage took a while (like 5 days close to the surgery day ðŸ˜“) I was able to get it all approved.

(I am getting a little sleepy with my meds so part two will be coming tomorrow!) ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ

Well done on getting through all that! I have a question: did you do hair removal down there prior to realising you&#39;d like to have surgery or after? If you did it after, what kind of hair removal did you go with? How many sessions. I&#39;m to have surgery in a few months, I did 4 laser sessions so far, and yet it doesn&#39;t seem like it helped at all. I will only have time for 2-3 more sessions and I&#39;m starting to get worried

My surgeon told me electrolysis wasnâ€™t required as he does hair follicle scrapping that removes hair follicles from the layer of skin he uses for the surgery. I would say if youâ€™re going with him electrolysis would at least still be beneficial!
