I made the mistake of going to him about 6 months ago. Worst decision of my life. He ruined my face.
</p>
<p>
Destroyed my nose - it‚Äôs harder to breathe and looks disgusting.
</p>
<p>
Took too much off my jaw- I never asked for the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù taken off, which practically cut into the roots of my teeth, where as I just wanted a minimal refinement.
</p>
<p>
He uses a straight line across the jaw to make form a ‚ÄúV‚Äù live. Well, my chin is off center. This means some of my skin and muscles are not supported. This means that my smile is now lopsided.
</p>
<p>
When I wanted a small boost with a little bit of filler he WAY overfilled me, heaving me to deal with multiple sets of injections trying to remove the stubborn filler.
</p>
<p>
His lip lift technique is outdated and compromised the movement and functions of my lips.
</p>
<p>
I would rather commit suicide, but my family wants me to keep living. So, they are going into debt to try and find someone else to fix what Chettawut did to my face.
</p>
<p>
In short: he is too arrogant and has no idea how to sculpt the face to create beauty. Please learn from my mistake and stay away from him for FFS.

Yeah, his prices pretty much what you get in Europe and USA! But I will say from some posts on Reedit, I really liked his results. Seems he is good at FFS, as well.

I have personally had FFS surgery with Dr Chettawutt and what I will say is don‚Äôt listen to people who have never had surgery in Thailand. Only take on board firsthand accounts based on facts with evidence to support the opinion of individual doctors.
</p>
<p>
I personally am in LOVE with my results!

Chettawut is not well known for FFS and Korea is risky as it‚Äôs very hard to research and there‚Äôs some bad surgeons.

You must be out of your mind to go to Thailand for FFS. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs your face; you will have to live with the result and your decision for the rest of your life. If you want the ok result, then you go to the ok surgeon; if you want a top result, you go to the top tier surgeon.

I am not, but will having ffs with Db soon. You can ask me in few months. Have been chatting with db‚Äôs patient, and they are all quite happy with the result only downside is he is vey expensive and waiting list is Long, so best to book consultation asap. He has a Ffs book you can buy online too.

Deschamps Braley in San Francisco. Went with him, and the result is super natural and feminine, after since, I am enjoying the result every single dollars I have paid.

Had my full ffs with him. The experience with him was very good. He really transformed me. I told him I want a dramatic change yet all natural looks. Showed him pics and all and he gave me exactly what I wanted. He and his team is very good. His jaw and chin work is very good. He gave me a beautiful round smooth forhead
