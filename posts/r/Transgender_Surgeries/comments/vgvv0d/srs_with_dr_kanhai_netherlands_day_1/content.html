Today i had bottom surgery with dr. Kanhai in the Netherlands. I had to be present at the clinic at around 6:45 AM which we made after a 2 hour long car trip. Upon arrival they instantly guided me to my room and went through personal information such as allergies, age, name, current medication, etc. After storing my clothes in the combination locked closet, i was ready to be taken to a big open hall where all patients wait for antibiotics, &#34;intravenous drip&#34;(?) and other preparations. One last look backwards and i noticed my mom getting emotional. Her daughter finally accomplishing what we worked so hard for. They will ask for you name and date of birth multiple times to verify they have the correct person.
</p>
<p>
I was located at the very beginning of the big hall and could see the doors where they drove people through into the hall. Eventually my surgeon walked in and went through the final questions with me and gave me an opportunity to ask questions if i had them. Everything was clear to me and i knew i just had to let it happen. They drove my bed towards the operating room and i was prepared to undergo surgery. The operating room was rather cold but they put some blankets around me to keep me warm. I had to transfer from my bed to the operating table and had to position in a specific way to have my butt on the edge of a little &#34;indent&#34;. They attached armrests to the surgery table and put an oxygen mask on me. Shortly followed by the anesthesia and i noticed i was losing consciousness. My hearing got worse after the anesthesia,  which is totally normal, but it felt as if you ascended in a ski lift and it compresses your ears. Exactly what happened after is unknown to me.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I woke up in the same hall i started in. Still feeling very slow and weak because of the anesthesia, i had trouble keeping my eyes open and registering what happened around me. I was given a pear flavored ice lolly for which i do not know the reason, not complaining though! It was delicious. Once i got brighter and woke up, they drove me to my room where i am currently writing this post. My parents stayed around for over 7 hours just wasting time in the vicinity because they wanted to see me wake up.
</p>
<p>
Once my parents left to go home, i was all alone in the room. My catheter tube disconnected and my bed was soaked. The nurses cleaned it up and renewed my bed sheets. During this time, i was asked to stand up. This went surprisingly well. However, i did get a bit light in my head and felt as if i would drop down any second, which i told them. They finished cleaning my bed and i was able to lay back down. The pressing underwear they have me were naturally also soaking wet. They had to change me. This was the first time i saw my genital area post surgery. A wave of satisfaction came over me when i saw the nuisance was gone. I was extatic! Shortly after this whole ordeal, i went to sleep. I only slept for 4 hours the night before. I will soon find out how tough the first night will be. The pain is not the issue, it&#39;s very bearable and significantly less bad than i was told and expected.
</p>
<p>
Apparently not much information is known about Kanhai, so feel free to use me as a source of information. I&#39;ll happily share my experiences with you lot. If you have questions, ask ahead!
</p>
<p>
I might write a followup for day 2. All i know is the surgeon will come to visit me to see if everything looks the way it is supposed to.
</p>
<p>
Do not hesitate to approach me if you have questions. I&#39;ll happily share what i can!

Wow, congratulations! :)
</p>
<p>
In exactly a week I will be in your position, so I&#39;m very curious to hear about your experiences. Tomorrow you already get to go home right? At least for a couple of days :)
</p>
<p>
When I saw they expected you so early in the morning I called the clinic, because they had not given me a time yet. Turns out: 6:45 as well -_- hopefully I can find someplace to sleep nearby the day before, because I don&#39;t really want to get out of bed at 3am.
</p>
<p>
Btw, the ice lolly you got (the world famous perenijsje) is to help your throat, because it can get a little bit irritated from the intubation. I&#39;ve had a couple of surgeries already, and every time that ice lolly feels so good afterwards haha

Ooohh, thanks! I didn&#39;t understand that at all. If the experience is universal, you&#39;ll be fine. Day 1 is mostly sleeping and getting your head around what happened. Day 2 so far is super boring. Just laying in bed and occasionally getting up to walk a little bit. Their also training my bladder by shutting the catheter tube off. They want to make sure i feel the need to pee which i do, albeit lightly. The pain is 2 or 3/10. It&#39;s really not that bad. It&#39;s just super uncomfortable! If you&#39;re also going to velsen chances are I&#39;ll see you next week, assuming you&#39;re also scheduled for the Monday. I wish you the best of luck, you got this! Always here if you need me!

Hey :) Hope things are well I saw this post is a year old but I still stumbled upon it today when googling about surgery places in the netherlands
</p>
<p>
Wondering if you had any updates, did you need any revisions? How happy are you with the results? I&#39;d love to know for my own consideration for srs
