Three weeks is around the time stitches are supposed to come out. They dissolve on their own. Do not yank or pull anything. Everything is still very swollen. Call your doctor with any questions.

Its likely not a concern, at 3 weeks they pulled most of mine and they are all dissolvable. My Dr told me that they pulled them as it encourages faster healing and more comfort for you. Try not to let it bother you, its not the stitches being gone or coming out that causes dehiscence anyways if you may be worried about that.

Try to relax. The stitches are supposed to come out. If they pop too early, that is usually a very common complication that will heal on its own eventually.

It’s fair that you’re anxious about a revision, but the vast vast majority of complications won’t require one. Try not to worry about that possibility until your doctor says you need one—very unlikely.

The stitches doing that is pretty normal.  You can have a doctor or someone you really trust trim them a few cm from the skin with sterile scissors to reduce the risk of them catching on things. I wouldn&#39;t recommend using a mirror to try it alone.
