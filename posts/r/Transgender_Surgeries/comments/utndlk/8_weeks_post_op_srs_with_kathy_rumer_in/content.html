Sensation? Depth? We need a bit more context before others get sent to be ‚ÄúRumered‚Äù.

Lots of people make new accounts for surgeon results, not strange at all.

I don‚Äôt have full sensation back yet since it‚Äôs only been 2 months, but I have had 2 orgasms &amp; my clitoris is very very sensitive (a little bit painful sometimes too) I also have just under 6 inches of depth! No complaints from me, I realize some people have had bad experiences with Dr. Rumer, but a majority have not including me. She did an amazing job &amp; her team has been so kind to me &amp; respond so quickly to any questions I have. However, the only reason I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going to her is because the hospital she operates out of is extremely outdated &amp; the staff is a complete mess. My hospital stay was a nightmare but I have had zero issues with Dr. Rumer herself ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Can I ask your total costs and wait time?  What procedure did you have done?
