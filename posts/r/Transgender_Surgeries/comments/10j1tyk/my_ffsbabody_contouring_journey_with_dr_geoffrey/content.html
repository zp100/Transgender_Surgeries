I&#39;m not going to post any nudity, I don&#39;t want my tits on the internet...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so happy with my results :)
</p>
<p>
I do have a small revision coming up for my chin, cheeks, and hairline. I&#39;ll update this post when I&#39;m all healed up.
</p>
<p>
I had Zero Depth Vaginoplasty followed by Colovaginoplasty with Dr. Stiller too. I&#39;ve written about that too here:

Congrats on your surgery! I’m very interested in hearing more especially about your chin and cheek and nose work. Dr. Stiller is my SRS “savior” and redid my whole surgery for me after I had a bad result from elsewhere. I just had a final revision with him including some fat grafting to my labia. After being so happy with his work on vaginoplasty I’m strongly considering him for my face work especially as he’s so close by. I don’t want a super aggressive chin reduction but I do need it narrowed and less square as well as a few other things. May I ask why you’re getting a few facial revisions?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Of course 🙂
</p>
<p>
You can only advance a hairline so much at one time, so he wasn&#39;t able to get the corners rounded out on the first go. I&#39;m totally happy with the height of my forehead though, it&#39;s just the corners that need a little more work. My cheeks are waaay better than they were before, but I think I wasn&#39;t careful enough so I lost a little more than I wanted. I&#39;m having him add just a little more because I think it will balance out my jaw a little better.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t include any profile pictures, which I should have because it would make it easier for you to see what I&#39;m talking about. Basically I originally had him shave down the bone on the front of my chin, but not the bottom, and I later decided that I made the wrong choice there. I think he did a great job and it&#39;s a massive improvement, but I&#39;m having him take off a little more to change the roundness of my chin to a more angular look that I think will suit my face better.
</p>
<p>
So I used to do woodworking with my friend as a hobby, and he used to say, you can always take more material but you can&#39;t put it back. I really like Stiller&#39;s work because I think that he&#39;s only as aggressive with his cuts as is needed. There&#39;s another style of FFS that&#39;s super aggressive. Deschamps-Braly (or however you spell it) is a good example, and while I think it&#39;s good work, it just isn&#39;t for me.
</p>
<p>
Oh and I&#39;m so happy with my nose! It took sooooo long for the swelling to go down lol but once it did I think it&#39;s super cute 🙂
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps 💛💛💛

It does indeed, thanks. I’m already mostly passable and am very settled into a life and have been for many years. If I were to go somewhere at this point and have a very aggressive surgery it would attract attention. However my chin is too long and a bit too square, my cheeks have deflated a bit, and the bridge of my nose needs a bit of work. I also need some neck tightening and maybe some lip lifting and a revision on previous forehead work. My chin needs the most aggression but the rest is more subtle improvement. I’ll see what I can do to get in for a consult just for FFS when I go back for my SRS revision exam.

I know that senseless comments aren’t very welcome however, I saw you and immediately said “That’s a pretty lady” so I hope that the reaction of an internet stranger makes your day better&lt;3

Girl I&#39;ve looked at your profile and you have nothing to be jealous of me for lol
</p>
<p>
You are so pretty! Like I totally understand only ever seeing the flaws when it comes to your own face but honestly I wish my face looked like yours does right now.
</p>
<p>
And you&#39;re so young, you get to keep your narrow shoulders! I didn&#39;t start til almost 29. I&#39;m lucky that I was born with hips but I wish I had shoulders that delicate 😭
</p>
<p>
You have so much to look forward to, don&#39;t get discouraged. I remember what it was like being in the middle of it and being so depressed I could barely move. But there&#39;s a point in your future where this time is something you barely ever think about anymore, I can promise you that from experience. Just hang on for that.
</p>
<p>
Love and hugs 💛💛💛
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;ve just realized that I missed the point. The thing you&#39;re jealous of is that moment where you don&#39;t see those flaws anymore because they&#39;ve been gotten rid of, whether anyone else can see them or not. I&#39;m sorry, I can be so dense sometimes 🙁
</p>
<p>
Your feelings about your face are valid. I hope you can get there soon and I&#39;m sorry again 💛
