In the pursuit of srs I tried to prepare myself as much as possible. Both mentally and with the supplies I would need when I when home.  What never could have imagined is how completely unprepared I was to be confined to a bed.  Told I&#39;m not allowed leave my bed.  Every few hours being poke and prodded for tests and vital checks and more medications.  I feel like while I am physically doing ok and I have minor bleeding and discharge, I am 100% dying mentally. I dont think I could have ever prepared enough for this...
</p>
<p>
I will finally get to meet her for the first time tomorrow before I&#39;m discharged from the Hospital.  This is the only thing keeping me going.

I‚Äôm one month post. It‚Äôs harder than I thought too. And it takes a long time to get back. I still can‚Äôt put my own socks on. Nobody seems to talk about how challenging this is. Just a heads up, it‚Äôs going to look scary at first. I likened it to a turkey when the packing was removed. I was devastated, but after a month in, and the swelling is reducing I look more normal. You will too. Now I know why they tell women after birth ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look at it‚Äù for a few days. ü§™ Don‚Äôt think so much about your feelings today, think about your feelings wearing your bikini this summer. ‚ô•Ô∏è

i don&#39;t have my date yet, but was told &#34;probably February&#34; so the long wait is almost over.
</p>
<p>
i had recently been thinking that i&#39;d not want to look until the point where i have to do self care stuff that required &#34;looking down&#34;
</p>
<p>
cos i just want to delay seeing things until its healed more.
</p>
<p>
but i wasn&#39;t sure how long i could hold off, or if anyone else felt that way...
</p>
<p>
so thanks for writing what you did... helps :)

I kind of feel that they didn‚Äôt warn me well enough, but perhaps didn‚Äôt want to scare me. I really wanted to see but didn‚Äôt expect that. I just want other girls to know what to expect, but know that a body does heal, and now I‚Äôm just starting to enjoy her looks. Looking at the calendar, I‚Äôm actually 5 weeks now. üôÇ

the emotional part of recovery is a lot more difficult than the physical part. Even when your mind feels ready to be active and your pain has subsided, it is very important to rest as much as possible so that you do not put strain on the incisions and open up wounds. Otherwise you could end up back in the hospital with profuse bleeding like I did last week, from trying to do &#39;too much too soon&#39;

Stay strong, sis. The first three months are harder, both physically and emotionally, than anyone can adequately describe. The most important thing is to have supportive people around you. And dilate, Dilate, DILATE! Make it your new religion.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, you‚Äôll look back and the grace to give yourself now will be a wellspring of strength in the future.
</p>
<p>
P.S. If you don‚Äôt already have one, an elevation cushion makes dilating sooooo much easier.

I got mine at Amazon. It‚Äôs similar to a wedge, but one side has a 45¬∞ angle leading to a flat top. You position your bottom on the angle with your legs across the top and lie back. It changes your pelvic tilt and makes dilator insertion ever so much easier.
</p>
<p>
This is entirely separate and distinct from your donut cushion for sitting.

Congratulations! Also, no one gets any rest in a hospital. There is always someone in the room almost every hour. Your home will feel like a palace after dicharge.

Can you say more about gabapentin? Were you taking it before or did they prescribe it in the hospital?

I know, nobody told me that it was too hard. I‚Äôm two months post op and I‚Äôm better but I still can‚Äôt doing things, like go to groceries or walking for long distance. I‚Äôm still at working from home and I can‚Äôt go to the office, I wouldn‚Äôt be able.

Sweet, so they are removing packing tomorrow and that&#39;s when you&#39;ll get to do the meet?
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s exciting, and you&#39;re right. If you don&#39;t have people there with you on a regular basis I can imagine it is mentally harsh.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping to have a digital device so I can at least be hooked to the web. Without it would be incredibly hard.

Yup, tomorrow is the day!
</p>
<p>
I do have my bestie with me so it&#39;s not necessarily the loneliness aspect, the part I&#39;ve struggled with is lying in bed 24/7 and not being able to just get up for a second and stretch, idk, I know not straining anything will be good for initial healing but also i feel like getting up and about would&#39;ve been helpful

You&#39;ll be fine üòÅ Though this is kind of the easiest part üòÖ
</p>
<p>
Eventually you need to start taking care of it. Which I say lovingly. It&#39;s such a personal experience, even with the set backs, I still appreciate this experience.

But it Eventually gets easier.

There‚Äôs a lot of info that goes out that‚Äôs incomplete, and sometimes quite wrong. Then there‚Äôs the other side, where there are things nobody mentions.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky in that my psych had me write Myself letters of encouragement, which helped.
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôre lying in bed right now to protect her. Too much blood flow to the area brings swelling and potentially damage or loss of tissue on your new kitty. Even with lying down, there may be some initial shocks. But it‚Äôs going to be ok. You‚Äôve come all this way and you‚Äôve got this. I‚Äôm still permitted up only limited amounts during the day too. So I understand.
</p>
<p>
There are other challenges ahead, such as the ride to where you‚Äôre staying (sitting is not fun at first) the new sensations with dilation, nerve reconnection, and so on.
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôre not alone.
