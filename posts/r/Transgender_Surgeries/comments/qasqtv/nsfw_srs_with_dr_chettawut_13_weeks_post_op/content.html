An update for anyone interested in my journey or in results from Dr. Chettawut-
</p>
<p>
So today makes three months since my surgery, a non-penile inversion vaginoplasty with scrotal graft by Dr. Chettawut in Bangkok, Thailand.  I gave my last update at 6 weeks here (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/pfkgv1/nsfw_srs_with_dr_chettawut_6_weeks_post_op/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/pfkgv1/nsfw_srs_with_dr_chettawut_6_weeks_post_op/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
</a>
)
</p>
<p>
The swelling has gone down significantly which is amazing.  For so long, it felt like a having a brick for genitals.  Aesthetically, I’m pleased with my vagina, especially as it settles. I didn’t realize how much it had progressed until I compared with the picture I shared around 6 weeks.  During the day-to-day, you become so accustomed that you might not gauge how far things have come along.  I have some granulation toward the top of the labia minora on the left hand side.  I honestly think that came from my walking a bit more than I should have and spreading the lips a bit too much.  There’s no blood or pain so I’m leaning toward leaving it for now.  My only other gripe, a minor one, is I guess the lack of a fourchette or how sometimes the opening can look a bit gaping?  Especially post dilation and then since my body is still getting used to green and orange, it can look a bit ‘open.’  Perhaps a revision may help with that?  Nevertheless, my vagina seems to fall within the normal variance of vaginas.  I’ve shown my vagina to my mother and cis girlfriends and family members and they all say that especially as it heals, it looks fine, like I’ve always had it.  I think that’s good.
</p>
<p>
Now that brings me to dilation.  It’s alright- very much a chore but not so bad once I get into it.  The hardest part is making sure to get the sessions done.  I’ll admit that I have missed a few but as always, I try to keep going and not stress about it.  Sometimes I may feel a bit tighter or may take a few more minutes to get to full depth before I can set the timer but nothing too calamitous to report.
</p>
<p>
As shown in the gallery, I purchased the green and orange Soul Source dilators.  I would like to be able to have comfortable penetrative sex and from what I’ve gleaned from the women here, the best way to prepare for that is by getting used to dilating with orange.  I had already been ahead of my revised dilation schedule.  The jump from 1 to 2 was not very difficult though 2 to 3 took a few days of getting to full depth.  About two weeks later, I began using Chett’s #4, which like 3 required a few days to get to full depth.  Two weeks after that, I started with green.  Going from 4 to green was like going from 1 to 2, not so bad.  Feeling cocky, the same day I started with green, I attempted orange.  That was unsuccessful and resulted in minor spotting.  So I figured I’d give myself a week or two to really get used to green and then see if I could manage orange.  I’ll also note that when I began with green, I was using 1, 3, and 4 (one day I had mistakenly lubed up 3 instead of 2 and then kept on using those).  I then used 3, 4, and green for 10, 20, and 20 mins.  That evolved into 25-25 for 4 and green.  To train the entrance and ready myself, I began using my fingers to stretch- much like sex, I figured.  A few days ago, I finally accomplished getting orange inside.  I now do 25 mins green and 25 mins orange.  With repetition, it does get easier to enter and get to full depth within 3-7 mins.  Sometimes longer if I go too long without dilating or I’m right from exercise.  Fingering is essential to taking green head-on.  Hopefully all of this work will make sex more comfortable when that moment arrives.  I may even order the 41 mm dilator from Soul Source.  We’ll see.
</p>
<p>
Sex wise- I am able to orgasm both through vaginal stimulation (clenching) and clitoral as well, as I’ve recently experienced now that the painful sensitivity has given way to more pleasurable sensation.  An orgasm from clitoral stimulation takes a bit longer and seems to be ‘deeper.’  There is moisture when I finger myself and fluid released from the urethra when I orgasm that drips into the vaginal canal.  I don’t necessarily think it’s enough for full on penetrative sex but it’s definitely not completely dry down there.
</p>
<p>
Concerning pain, I still have some swelling I think internally that I just have to wait to go down.  I also experience the occasional itching/spurts of pain as the nerves / sensation reconnect.  My energy levels are decent.  I started running again- light jogs  about 1.5 mi.  I have to build up my endurance after not running for 4 months but physically, I didn’t notice any spotting or any pressing concerns other than muscle tightness afterward so dilation post exercise is a bit tougher.  It may be advisable to stretch after exercise and wait some time to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Overall, this has been a very good experience and I’m thankful for everything Dr. Chettawut and his team did for me.  I also appreciate the hordes of advice I’ve gleaned from posts in this community.  It really helped allay my worries and  guide me on the track toward a good, functional result.

wow congratulations you’re healing so nicely!
</p>
<p>
can you do any running or core exercises yet?
</p>
<p>
also, what is granulation tissue exactly? like everything was so pink but that one area you pointed out was red, that’s granulation? does it hurt?
</p>
<p>
thank you for sharing this!!

Hi there- I just started running again last week.  Technically one week earlier than Chett advised but I started slowly.  I used to run 6 mi 6 days a week before my surgery.  Last week I did 1.5 mi 4 days.  Today and hopefully this week I’m going to attempt to do 3 and then work my way up to 4.5 and then 6.  Wish me luck! I lost a lot of my endurance.
</p>
<p>
Granulation tissue is basically what happens when there is a tear- it ‘overheals’ - the cells can overproduce a layer of flesh.  The pink you see is not granulation, that’s the vulval vestibule which contains the urethral opening.  Only the small red part is the granulation.  None of it hurts nor does it bleed.  Right now it just looks a little inflamed but again, because it doesn’t hurt or bleed, I’m inclined to leave it and maybe when I visit a gynecologist, I may have silver nitrate applied if necessary.
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much!

The Hello Kitty mirror is a right of passage for Chettawut ladies!
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much!  The swelling takes so long to go down but I think with me being active from the day the packing was removed, it helped bring my body along.  Hopefully things will only improve from here.

Hi love!! We’ve messaged a bit! With discharge- still a bit from the clitoris/around there but nothing too bad.
</p>
<p>
I HIGHLY recommend getting the green and orange.  Not only does it help expanding width which is good prep for sex but I also find it’s helping my vaginal entrance ‘open’ when I need to dilate (and hopefully during sex) as well as making getting to full depth an easier process.  Entering and then getting the final inch or so of depth was always really hard.  Now that I’ve used green for about two weeks and orange for nearly a week, it’s beginning to be a much quicker process.  The tapered edge also helps train entrance and make it easier.

Thank you! At times I worry that my outcome looks weird or strange.  But even when my worries are at a hilt, I still feel this attachment to my body that I would not trade for anything in the world.  I’m so thankful everything went as smoothly as it has.

Hi, hmmm, I’m not sure I’d necessarily orgasm solely from penetration (though I have yet to have sex or use anything other than a dilator so who knows?).  I can orgasm from clenching and squeezing my thighs and then clitoral stimulation.

I&#39;m curious, do you know why your labia majora looks all wrinkly, like the skin from the scrotum? Do you know if the wrinkly look will go away with time?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t mean to offend. I&#39;m just looking at your results and then looking at the images on Chet&#39;s website and your labia looks way different from what is on the site itself. Skin color not withstanding. It just doesn&#39;t look like what he says he&#39;s done in the past.
</p>
<p>
Also I&#39;m glad you are happy with  your results!

Which picture are you talking referring to?  I don’t see any white stuff.  If you’re referring to the pink, that is where the urethral opening is located above the vaginal orifice.

This part
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/WudU68W" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
! Sorry, I&#39;m colourblind so it might be light pink and I just see it as white. Just doesn&#39;t look quite the same colour as other pictures I&#39;ve seen.

Aha- no worries.  I was scared for a moment- ‘what white part, was there something I missed.’
</p>
<p>
Anyway- yes, what you’ve circled is the urethral opening (exactly where my urine comes from) directly above the vaginal canal.  What I think is precum / cum also comes from there with sufficient preparation.

Oh okay. That whole area? I&#39;ve seen other examples that are closer in colour to the inner labia.
