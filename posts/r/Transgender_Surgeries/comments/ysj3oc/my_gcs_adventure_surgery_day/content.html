So figured I might share some deets, or what I have anyway, from my surgery day.
</p>
<p>
We were told to be at the hospital for 7:30. Didn&#39;t get pulled into pre-op until 8:30. Didn&#39;t make me nervous, just anxious to get in.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op nurse was delightful. Transport guy literally couldn&#39;t pronounce my name. Then he forgot my paperwork and just left me in the middle of a hallway.
</p>
<p>
The OR felt like it was the farthest from the pre-op area it possibly could be. I mean, we kept going until there was a wall in front of us. That long ride honestly started hitting me with a bit of anxiety I hadn&#39;t experienced at all throughout this process.
</p>
<p>
Anesthesia technicians were delightful. I let them know I struggle with needlephobia occasionally so they typically keep my mind going by asking questions. The student helping out was obviously not good at improv, so I had to just kind of keep talking to avoid get sick. Once they had the IV in they had me sign a bunch of paperwork, then set me up for an epidural. While doing that they gave me &#34;something to relax&#34; and right before that was honestly the only time I felt queazy before going in. Once I got in the OR and settled, they had me knocked out within a matter of moments. That was around 10am based on when they had me sign the paperwork.
</p>
<p>
Next thing I knew I was waking up around 4:30pm in the post op room. My heels and my elbows hurt more than anything else on my body. Once I was fully awake I asked about when I was going to a room and they were just trying to find a place for me, saying I might need to stay in post op for the night. The stretcher they had me on fucking sucked. It was super uncomfortable. At about 5:45 they found a room and got me upstairs. I was loopy and already doing my best Don Rickles. My nurse hooked me up by grabbing my backpack instead of waiting for whoever was going to bring it at like 8pm.
</p>
<p>
They hooked me up with some crackers and Gatorade, followed by my meal like 5 minutes later. I was absolutely starving (last meal I had was Tuesday night). Starting eating, and then all of a sudden felt sick. My roommate got up and hooked me up with a pan literally in the nick of time. It was the tiniest bit of food, and I was able to go back to eating shortly.  Afterwards I was texting and messaging and thanking everyone for their thoughts and messages in my circle of friends.
</p>
<p>
Because of the epidural, I&#39;m pretty much just in bed or a chair for the next 3 days. As of right now I was told I should be released on Tuesday (post op day 5). That could push to Wednesday depending on how things go, but most likely not.

I will share more as time goes on. Dr. Winograd&#39;s team helped me through my journey.
