I think BBL is currently the best surgeon in the US. I wouldn’t recommend anybody to go to Bowers

I&#39;m very sorry you&#39;ve had that experience. Sadly even with great surgeons there are percentages of folks who don&#39;t recover/turn out well. That&#39;s why so many folks get revisions.
</p>
<p>
Edit: the following doesn&#39;t just apply to you but applies to a lot of people on this sub but I&#39;ve seen a disproportionate number of people harping on Dr. Bowers for things that she was clear going in were possible outcomes.
</p>
<p>
She is not the only doctor to have produced poor results on occasion. She is not the only doctor to produce results similar to yours on occasion. I know somebody who went with supposedly the best peritoneal pull through doctor in the country and she also has been left with chronic pain issues to the point where she needs painkillers in order to manage how bad it gets. Nobody gets on that surgeon for those outcomes.
</p>
<p>
How a lot of people on this sub will only go after a doctor if she&#39;s trans or if they&#39;re not white. I&#39;m really sorry that you had the experience that you did but you knew full well going in that this was a possible outcome. That&#39;s what we call informed consent care, and if you chose not to read through the possible outcomes and way that as a possibility then that&#39;s on you, not on the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d recommend you take a good hard long look in the mirror and examine the trans misogyny problem that you clearly have and do some self-reflection. Stop trying to blame other people for the decisions that you made before you did your research.

I can understand your frustrations with Bowers&#39;s aftercare because I&#39;ve experienced all that as well but I&#39;ve reached out to her office and always gotten a prompt response. Do you really expect a full-time surgeon to take time out of her busy schedule every single time to be able to communicate with you? If so then that is a very unrealistic and quite frankly entitled expectation of the time of a very busy person. People in positions like her have support staff like her office for a reason and it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t have the time to give a very personal in-depth response to literally every one of her patients, especially that far out. It&#39;s also quite interesting that you say she told you that her message didn&#39;t require hair removal when both her preoperative paperwork and her website very clearly state differently. In the preoperative Communications that I had with her she said that it is possible to do the procedure with no prior hair removal but that it was quite discouraged and that for the best results as much hair removal as possible should be done prior to surgery. Basically what I&#39;m saying is that either she completely and totally changed all of the information in her pockets and her paperwork and what she tells patients directly over the course of a year between when you got yours done and I got mine done, or you are misremembering what happened.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it&#39;s possible that what you&#39;re saying is 100% accurate but I find that highly unlikely when both myself and the other patient of hers whom I have spoken with have stated things contrary to your perception. I really don&#39;t want to be harsh but even the best of surgeons can&#39;t get things right 100% of the time especially if their patient doesn&#39;t do the preoperative preparation that is stated is highly recommended in the intake paperwork.
</p>
<p>
If you chose to not have any hair removal done prior to surgery then that&#39;s your responsibility and you have to take accountability for that. As for the chronic pain that you suffer, Dr. Bowers isn&#39;t the only one who has had a patient end up with chronic pain conditions post op. A good friend of mine went with BBS and she ended up with chronic pain. That&#39;s not the surgeons fault, that&#39;s just bad luck.
</p>
<p>
At a certain point you have to take personal responsibility for your part in the surgical process and while not all of your results are your fault, they&#39;re not the fault of the surgeon either.

It seems like you’ve already decided, in a way. You mention your worry with Bowers’ methods, and that risk would be less with RBL.
</p>
<p>
I think you should go with RBL, her results are better and more consistent IMO. She also is more up to date on current methods, and has an extensive background in urology which is crucial.

To add, Dr. Zhao is a urological surgeon/specialist that performs that part of the procedure with RBL which was kind of nice to have reassurance of the speciality in that area (not to saw Bowers doesn&#39;t do an equally good job, just no experience with her personally).

I had just got off the phone with RBL&#39;s office and seemingly got a consult appointment in December... then an hour later I got a call back from them saying there was a &#39;mistake&#39; and there is no appointment for Dec... and that the next available one is July of 2023... ugh. I&#39;m feeling so shitty now, just absolutely toyed with. I had my hopes up so high and everything seemed so perfect about going with RBL...

Dr. Min jun in San Francisco did a fellowship at NYU with Dr. BbL, and Zhao. He does an identical technique. I’ve heard good things about him

Seeing your edit, Dr. Min Jun was trained by BBL and uses the same technique. You might want to look into him! I got mine done with him and am V satisfied, you can see my results on my page.

I’m going with Dr. Dy who did a fellowship under Dr. Bluebond-Langner. She also does an identical approach. Dr. Blair Peters will be the surgeon doing the vulva part going forward. Tho, there is collaboration between the two for the vulva since Dr. Dy is done with the vagina before vulva is completed

Nearly 6 months post Bowers and loving it. 6in depth with only about 15% loss in sensation.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t really know of BBL till recently and by then I was 3 weeks out from surgery so I just went ahead rather than get on another wait list.
