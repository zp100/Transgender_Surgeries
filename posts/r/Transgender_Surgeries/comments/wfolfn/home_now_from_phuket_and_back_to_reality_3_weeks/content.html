Check my post history for details, Dr Sanguan at PPSI in Phuket was my surgeon. Such a skilled professional and a beautiful man.
</p>
<p>
My healing is proceeding very well, I&#39;m feeling a bit tender down there as skin and nerves come back to life but all un all it&#39;s great.

If it isn’t too personal, I was wondering what you penile length was prior to grs? I’ve been wondering how that information translates to final depth? Thank you!

Hi there
</p>
<p>
Happy to respond, my penis was of average length (can&#39;t recall measuring it but maybe 5 - 6&#34;?) but it and my scrotum had shrunk due to the effects of HRT.  None of this effected my vaginal depth as the penis was used for the vulva and the canal was made with what little scrotal skin I had plus skin from my upper thigh / groin area.  I get just on 6.5 inches now, 3 month after surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you go for PPT methods then the depth is dependent on how much intestine / colon they harvest for that.
</p>
<p>
So, small penis is OK!

Thank you. I a little over average, but circumcised so I always wondered how it all worked out. Thank you again.

I was circumcised as well, and according to the surgeon it was not a good circumcision as there was not much skin between the the scar and glans. You should be fine, just talk to the surgeon and understand what the intention and plan is.
