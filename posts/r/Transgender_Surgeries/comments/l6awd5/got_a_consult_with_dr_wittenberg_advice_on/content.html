Hi, this is my first post here, but I&#39;ve used this group a lot for info and reviews and photos. I&#39;ll be having a consult with Dr. Wittenberg, primarily because I&#39;m interested in PPT and her reputation and credentials are pretty good. I&#39;ve had one consult before with a different surgeon, but it was so rushed, I really didn&#39;t get a chance to address things with that surgeon. I was wondering if y&#39;all have some good standard questions for me to ask. I have a list of my own, but I don&#39;t want to leave any stone unturned. Thank you!

She pretty much goes through the run down with ppt during consult. I don’t know what question you could have that haven’t been answered in the groups already. Pretty standard vaginaplasty with peritoneal instead of penile tissue used.

I&#39;m sorry that happened sweetie, but Dr. Wittenberg was totally okay with discussing those things. I got a whole hour with her to discuss procedures. She&#39;s a very nice person, same with the staff that I met.

I&#39;m not sure what exactly it was I said that caused that outcome. Those are just the points I think I diverge the most from the norm about; I asked about the possibility of altering bone structure as part of the process, and I imagine that&#39;s not common.

Yeah, as far as I know, it isn&#39;t common. It could be too dangerous or something to that effect. Hang in there &lt;3

Probably is, or sets up a mechanical issue. I wasn&#39;t insistent, I just asked.
