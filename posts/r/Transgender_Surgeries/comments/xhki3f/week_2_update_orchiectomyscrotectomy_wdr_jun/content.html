It&#39;s been pretty good, I&#39;ve posted a few update posts on this sub if you&#39;re interested in specifics. My surgery was like 9 days ago and my pain has been pretty minimal and I&#39;ve been able to move around ok at this point.

Nice!! What made you decide to go with the scrotectomy too? I’m considering it but I believe most SRS surgeons require scrotal skin

I have a serious fear of surgery thb so vaginoplasty is totally out of the question for me. I had pretty extreme dysphoria about my testicles and scrotum in particular so this was the furthest I could muster to go. It took me years to justify it&#39;s reward over it&#39;s risk and even then, I was so scared when I got to the hospital. Especially lying on the surgery table and everyone realizing that the nurse put my IV in wrong because the anesthesia just sprayed out of my arm when they injected me with it, I just about had a panic attack. Luckily the anesthesiologist put it in my other arm and I was out like a light.
</p>
<p>
Tldr: Fear of getting vaginoplasty, and my dysphoria was primarily testicular.

Yeah if you want SRS absolutely do not get a scrotectomy. Orchiectomy can still be done (tell your surgeon you want srs later so they can use a technique that won&#39;t f it up) but do not get a scrotectomy.

Yeah, I mean you could technically still get vaginoplasty if you really wanted after but it would be a great deal harder and definitely more expensive. Most surgeon who are doing things like nullification and penile preservation vaginoplasty would be able to do it but anyone else you&#39;d have a hard time with them even attempting to do it.

Not all the way up, but some of the way. I have e a fairly dark line that goes up anyway so my surgeon ended the incision so it kinda blended in. The incision goes up that high because I had a decent amount of skin on my scrotum and I wanted a fairly flat results (hoping it&#39;s totally flat when the swelling subsides).

Later this week I have an appt with a surgeon for exactly the same;

I, too, want a really flat profile so I can comfortably wear a bikini at the beach, and pencil-skirts; I think they look very professional.

I kind of

I get fortunate enough to have SRS - but at my age (69) I suspect my chances for approval are rapidly diminishing.

Yeah, I mean the whole reason I got mine is to make it easier to tuck. And I mentioned in other comments that vaginoplasty is totally off the table for me regardless of getting this or not. If you wanted 0 depth down the road that&#39;s basically the only thing, other than nullification, that you could do after scrotectomy

Wow I have to say that is a visual.  I have been wondering what orchi+scrotectomy looked like.  I hadn&#39;t really considered how rough the recovery would be with such a long incision.  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing well.  I had heard it was a much more considerable recovery.
</p>
<p>
I just had my Orchi (no scrotectomy, since I may still get a zero depth GRS).  Definitely different looking haha.  I am one week out and look like a purple spotted dragon down there.  So much bruising its bonkers.  But the doctor insisted on yoinking my cords and sealing them off as high as possible.  Kind of bonkers how high he managed 😅 !

It&#39;s still very swollen, my surgeon said the swelling will be totally gone around 6 months so there will be nothing there but my penis after that. Recovery isn&#39;t too much longer, the incision will be fully closed around 6 weeks so after that it&#39;s just getting rid of the swelling, so honestly not much different than just an Orchi, you just have to be be a little more careful about not pooping stitches since things are a little tighter down there.My surgeon also took my cords as high as possible so you can&#39;t feel the cord stump.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy I got mine, a bit jarring that the swelling makes it look like I still have everything, but it&#39;ll be nice once it&#39;s all healed up.

Thanks! Would definitely recommend if you don&#39;t want vaginoplasty! You could technically do it after but it would be a good deal more difficult.

Did you have any side effects such as a seroma?
</p>
<p>
I am suffering from a fairly large seroma 2.5 weeks after surgery. I am hoping it goes away with hot and cold compresses. I go back in 4 weeks to the urologist. If it doesn&#39;t subside he&#39;ll have to remove it.

Oh interesting, possibly. I just googled it and I didn&#39;t know this was a thing. The swelling in the area where my scrotum was used to be liquid feeling and now it&#39;s solid, so possibly. My surgeon said that&#39;s very normal and it will start going away 4-6 weeks and be just about gone in 6 months. It started like day 2 though so idk if it&#39;s a thing that typically happens a while after?
</p>
<p>
Edit - after some deeper googling it looks like that is what is going on. The timeline my surgery gave me seems to check out and it hasn&#39;t been getting any bigger so I&#39;m not too worried. If it doesn&#39;t subsides by week 4 I&#39;ll probably talk to him about possibly getting it drained. Although, it looks like if you go down the draining path it could lead to further complications and will possibly just fill back up. Everything I&#39;ve seen (in my 10 minute searching frenzy lol, mostly veterinary papers) suggest not to do anything unless there is signs of irritation or infection because it&#39;s already sterile and will go away on its own eventually.

Sounds exactly like what I have. It might be wishful thinking on my part but I think the size of the seroma is starting to shrink. So fingers crossed.
</p>
<p>
Early on I had just lots of general swelling and bruising. That went away after about a week.

I just added my search findings to my earlier comment.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure it did shrink, it looks like bodies are pretty good at absorbing that stuff back into your body as long as it&#39;s sterile. I haven&#39;t really had much bruising luckily, just a little patch after my ~4hr drive back from the hospital, but that was honestly expected and I&#39;m surprised how minimal it was tbh.
</p>
<p>
So indeed fingers crossed on the last lump we&#39;ll ever have in there going away on its own!

Thanks for the update. I agree with you.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s just dysphoria inducing. It feels like a giant testicle which now is even worse to think about than before since hrt had greatly atrophied them prior to surgery.

Oh I totally agree with that! It&#39;s so disgusting looking to me considering the only dysphoria I was experiencing pre-op/post hrt was my testicles. Tbh for the first few days after I took the gauze off I couldn&#39;t look at it because I thought I was going to hurl :p

Since I got a scrotectomy the incision is significantly longer than just an Orchi since you are removing the whole scrotum not just making a hole to pull the testicles out. It&#39;s hard to see in the picture but the incision doesn&#39;t actually go all the way up my penis, it only goes up like ⅓ of the way.
