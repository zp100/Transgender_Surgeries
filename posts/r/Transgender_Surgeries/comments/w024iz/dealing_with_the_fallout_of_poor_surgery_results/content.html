Sorry you are experiencing issues, I know how it feels to be very unhappy about GRS results. My surgeon in the UK rushed and he did a very poor job.
</p>
<p>
I have a similar issue with dilation in that it is very uncomfortable getting to depth no matter how slowly I go so I just ram it it if I am upset or angry and get it over with asap. I&#39;m only at 8 months though, and still hoping for some improvement. I have managed to go up to the largest size dilator hoping that it would make it easier to use the smaller ones, it does but within a few days it tightens up again and I&#39;m back where I started but more frustrated.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hopefully having a revision with a different surgeon but the stress of waiting is driving me loopy. Similar to you I also have issues with the way it looks, the stitches were huge and didn&#39;t join the skin together so I have a huge obvious V scar in dark purple. Also very little clitoral sensation and not enough to climax.
</p>
<p>
One thing I can suggest is to speak to a therapist or doctor and maybe get something for depression. It&#39;s mostly working for me and nobody cares about just leaving me on multiple SSRI&#39;s they just want me out of the way. I found CBT worse than useless and if anything it made me worse, they have no idea of what I have been through and it just delayed my access to the SSRI&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t start about how bad it feels to not be able to climax any more. The last time I tried I just ended up making my clitoris numb very quickly and was sore on the inside for a week.
</p>
<p>
I really hope you can get it sorted and someday be able to treat it like just another part of you, that&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping as well.
</p>
<p>
Huge hug from me x

It will be fine in a few months; just wait more than 9 months. He&#39;s a skilled surgeon. üëç

It may be an idea to make a few photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe/content.md#miroslav-djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic</a>
in Europe may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website.
