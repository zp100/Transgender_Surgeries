I am into stealthy hookup culture and I would like to be able to remove several white scars that I got out of the bottom surgery to be more passable but I am not certain if there are any effective treatments cause the scars are hypopigmented.
</p>
<p>
AFAIK lasers and steroids are not effective for hypopigmentation .

I had a post-surgical plan to minimise scarring as much as possible, the first procedure I had was c02 laser which helps stimulate collagen and flatten the scar as much as possible, the second was steroid injections to thin the scar tissue which helps to create paper thin scarring since were only removing the superficial scarring. Now i’m doing PRP injections and micro needling. I have planned to get medical tattooing done but with the way things are looking I don’t think i’ll need it.

Naturally they will go away over time. I&#39;ve met girls who are 10+ years post-op and by then you can&#39;t see them anymore, even with the more antiquated 20th century techniques they got at the time.
</p>
<p>
With advancements in scar tech though, laser resurfacing has incredibly promising results and plenty of people get scars of various sorts all over their body to a point where you cannot tell via utilization of laser resurfacing.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also medical tattooing if that&#39;s not good enough, steroid creams and other prescription methods to improve scar healing, and a lot of it depends on your genetics &amp; how gentle you are on your parts during your healing process along with what you do to manage incisions early on.
</p>
<p>
If your scars are not preferable there&#39;s also scar revision surgery which can have excellent results as the scar revision surgery is solely focused on making a perfect/neat incision while primary vaginoplasty and primary surgeries in general are more focused on the bigger picture which can make incisions sloppier in the primary surgery. I&#39;m guessing there are also ways in a scar revision where they could excise the previous scar in order to move it more towards your thigh crease to hide it better.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also the better &amp; easier option of them all too: pubes. They can definitely mask the area and make any scarring less noticeable.

Retinol cream used VERY carefully oughta help a bit if you use it for a while, I noticed after using it on my face for a while that scars on my fingers since childhood had noticeably faded just from using them to apply it.

I looked at your results and your scars can certainly be diminished with laser and steroids.

Thanks but I don&#39;t notice mine very much and neither did anyone else irl. I&#39;m fine with them. If they would be sensitive enough to pick those up they would pick up a ton of other things too.

Look into scar camouflage. Might be worth it till they fade. Stealthy here too. Mine were like not noticeable at all but I had a revision on the left labia and the scar is SO visible and ugly I hope it will fade to white. But using scar gel for now

My sister had really nasty scars from getting slammed by a car, and she used this &#34;bio oil&#34; lotion stuff and they disappeared over a year and a bit?

Bio oil isn&#39;t effective for old scars.

Its questionable all for anything. Silicon is the proven treatment.

Silicon hasn&#39;t been proven treatment for old depigmented scars either. It&#39;s mainly used on fresh scars after surgery.

Looking into silicone gels or pads and also Contractubex and Mederma may be an option.
</p>
<p>
And some people use medical tatooing,
<a href="https://drchristinemcginn.com/services/tattoo.php" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
was an example (NSFW). Asking at local clinics who do reconstructive surgery may be an idea, they could point to affiliated people.
