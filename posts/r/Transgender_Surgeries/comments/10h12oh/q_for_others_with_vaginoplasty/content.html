I had my surgery in October so I’m just over three months postop.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t have labiaplasty, just vaginoplasty. Specifically peritoneal pull through, penile-preserving vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Around my introitus (hate that word but that’s what it’s called) there’s this white-ish skin in parts.   My surgeon says it’s likely scar tissue where my skin and the peritoneal lining have grown together. She said it should pinken up over time (my wording).  It’s usually initially painful to dilate.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the sides and tops of my opening are sort of firm. Is anyone else like that?  Was it ever?  Did it change at all?
</p>
<p>
The only vaginas I’ve had hands on time with other than my own were cisgender gals’. The parts I would initially touch were labia, which are soft. I just don’t know if the opening to the V itself is a little firm. Inside there is muscles and pressure and all that.  I never really thought (or knew) that the initial part I was touching wasn’t her vagina. And I don’t know anyone who’s going to let me clinically examine theirs.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been told I’m healing well aside from granulation popping up repeatedly. I’m just trying to get a sense if things will get softer around the opening down there.

I got the exact same thing as you. The scar tissue softens a lot over the first year, and probably after that too (I&#39;m only about 13 months post-op myself).

I&#39;m about 3 months post, full peritoneal pull through.  The area above the entroitus, around my urethra is very firm.  The rest I think feels pretty similar to my cis wife&#39;s.  I can&#39;t think of anywhere else that feels firm except at the very deepest point in the canal, there&#39;s some pain and stiffness for the first few minutes during dilation.

How can you tell the back is firm?  (I only ask cause my fingers aren’t long enough to hit the back in myself - and the angle would be wrong anyway.)
</p>
<p>
I’m starting to think some of the pain I feel at first might be more related to granulation and sore muscles being pressed on. I was told by my surgeon that granulation tissue itself has no nerve endings. Maybe that’s true, but certainly whatever is around or under it has nerve endings. I can usually tell from the pain when I’m going to pull out the wand and it’ll be streaked in blood. Granted it’s not a lot of blood, few drops, but still more than there ought to be.
</p>
<p>
The reason I’ve thought it might be more muscles still adjusting/healing is that some of the discomfort I feel when I insert a dilator feels like inserting anally a toy that’s a little too big.

Firm might be the wrong word, but the muscles at the back of my canal feel stiff with the dilator,  rather than supple.  Massage with the tip of the dilator seems to help relax the muscles enough to get the last inch or so inserted.
</p>
<p>
A little blood especially early on is normal, the sutures can weep slightly, especially under the tension from dilation.
</p>
<p>
I do feel some muscle tenderness especially on the left/right sides just inside the canal.  Feels just like your calfs might after some time on a stair climber.  It is slowly improving so I suspect it&#39;s just part of healing.

I&#39;m sorry for your issues but could you consider a revision?

I’m only at 3 months. I’m not planning on one, generally.
</p>
<p>
I’m trying to see if people post op have the same level of firmness (or lack thereof) all around the opening of their vagina.
