Do you know what caused the dehiscence ? How come they don&#39;t do anything to repair it once it&#39;s happened?

Dunno just swelling and tightness probably. I was very careful to move super slow and avoid dehiscence but when I started dilating it seemed to make it worse (or maybe that&#39;s when it started, I don&#39;t remember tbh). I&#39;d definitely recommend people try and avoid it if possible lol because it heals a lot faster the normal way. Honestly I wish someone had just told me to stick with the smallest dilator until it&#39;s properly healed because as long as you maintain depth that&#39;s fine to do and it definitely reduces the risk of early fourchette dehisence.
</p>
<p>
They don&#39;t repair it because there&#39;s no sterile way to do it I think and there would be risks of e.g. infection by stitching it back up at that point (it was about 5 days after surgery after all). It&#39;s also fine to let it heal by second intention healing too so that&#39;s normally the way they go I think, it&#39;s just a bit slow.

what will the outcome be like in terms of scarring around the dehiscence area?

Dunno, there&#39;s only a tiny bit tbh because it mostly just contracted inwards and joined the existing skin back up. From reading about second intention wound healing though it seems like once it&#39;s fully closed up the final stage is actually a reconstitution stage where all the temporary tissue gets replaced over time with normal tissue so it&#39;ll probably just be normal skin eventually, maybe with a little discoloration. It probably won&#39;t be that noticeable compared to my main stars (which&#39;ll hopefully fade over time + I&#39;m using silicone and massaging them etc to help them along.)

Hi there, your results look really great and I hope you‚Äôre healing up well since this post!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been referred to St George‚Äôs as well and I‚Äôm wondering if you know what the BMI limit there is and if it‚Äôs higher than at Parkside? I‚Äôm curious as I‚Äôm on the higher end of the bmi scale.

Hey there üôÇ I dunno about Parkside but it&#39;s 31 at St George&#39;s. I had a lot of weight to lose lol but I managed to get just under it for my consultation and then a bit further still before my actual surgery. It&#39;s worth it if you can but I know it&#39;s hard since I&#39;m struggling with my last few kgs now @_@

You‚Äôre a life saver!!! Thanks for letting me know, it‚Äôs been really difficult finding out the specifications prior to consult which they said would be in 2 months. I‚Äôm currently 30.9 on the BMI calculator so I think I‚Äôll just try to shift a few KG in time for my consult.
</p>
<p>
Thank you :)

My you have healed up well, and your scars don&#39;t look bad.  As for being asymmetric that&#39;s called character. All Vulva&#39;s need a bit of character and most are slightly asymetic in one way or another natal and trans.
