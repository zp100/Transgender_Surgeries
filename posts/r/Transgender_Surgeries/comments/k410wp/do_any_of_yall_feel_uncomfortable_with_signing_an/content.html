Do any of y’all feel uncomfortable with signing an arbitration agreement for SRS (Wittenberg/MoZaic) even before consultation?

I hope nothing goes wrong, of course, but arbitration
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.amp.html">tends to favor the professional</a>
so it’s a lot of risk I’m getting into. Just trying to gauge your opinions.

Given that it seems no ones ever successfully sued a trans surgeon in the USA it’s not like you had any recourse anyway, but this is taking it to the next level. It’s unethical.

They refuse to schedule my consultation until I sign the arbitration agreement. Never seen something like this before.

I mean, I did my best to post my consults and even take questions for follow-ups with the surgeon&#39;s staff.  But yeah, I did that partially because I didn&#39;t see much in the way of consults being posted.

All the surgeons in SF does that. I signed it because its just a consultation. If you dont like them the  dont use them. I loved Dr W and her office from the moment I met her so I had no doubt about her abilities.

She seems like a decent person and from the results I’ve seen she is also a damn-good surgeon. I figured I would sign one of these before the surgery, and I’m okay with that. Just seems a lil extra to ask for a signed arbitration agreement before I’ve even had a chance to speak to a doctor.

My thoughts is that they do that so they don’t go through the whole process of setting up dates and insurance just to have someone NOT want to sign right before, separates the serious patients out

It could be a requirement for malpractice insurance. Even the best surgeon can be sued and this is a way for the professional to protect themselves. It doesn’t mean she doesn’t trust her work, just like drafting your will doesn’t mean you think you will die soon.

That&#39;s unlikely, because other surgeons don&#39;t require it. Sounds like she was sued by a former patient.

“Sounds like?” Please forgive my directness, but a statement like this should always be backed with a link to the evidence.

In this case it is a guess based on teleological evidence (deriving origins from function). An arbitration agreement is worse for the patient and better for the provider in the case of a dispute over care, and therefore an indication the provider is worried about a dispute over care - presumably because such disputes have happened in the past.

I understand where your guess comes from—yet it’s still just that, a guess. No different than thinking someone gets good car insurance in order to drive wrecklessly. What I am saying is that if you are going to speculate on something like this, something that can potentially tarnish a surgeon’s reputation, I’d have some kind of evidence up my sleeve. Otherwise it just seems unfair. Listen, in the end it’s anyone’s prerogative whether they want to sign an arbitration agreement. If you think it gives a surgeon an advantage in potential litigation and you are uncomfortable with it, don’t sign it and find a different provider.

All I can say is I started a Malpractice case against A top Beverly Hills Surgeon In May of this year for a SRS surgery that turned me into a butchered  up mess. I am in litigation now and will win I am pretty sure  He doesn&#39;t want his picture on the inter net I posted my case on this  here in reddit under  user 11com69. It names the surgeon and the place of  the court as well.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t sign any consent forms till having a nice Q&amp;A meeting.?

Thanks for being this up.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been reporting lots of practices that someone could classified as dishonest towards the trans community from the clinic in Montreal.
</p>
<p>
I do not think you should sign this as this is like buying a new car or house and taking all responsibility from there get go.
</p>
<p>
But I know how you probably feel, if you don’t sign it you won’t get the surgery so I’m a way you are kind of forced signing it for your own mental health.
</p>
<p>
This proves to me that, these surgeons have no understanding of the reality of what we are going thru.
</p>
<p>
How many patient had to sign those prior to their surgery? I personally don’t know. It’s the first time I hear about such a thing.
</p>
<p>
I would probably have ended up signing it just because I needed the surgery which makes it dishonest in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
At a point in time, our community will have to start standing together and demand that we are being treated with respect.
</p>
<p>
Im not from USA but I see multiple post of people being amazed by Biden nominating some transwomen I think ok his team. Maybe next time he smiles and says he love trans people. Maybe bring things like that to his attention and see how really interested he actually is.
</p>
<p>
I know in Canada, it looks good ok paper and on TV but things are not pink and rainbows for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Wish you all the best with your decision. I know it when you are forced into signing something.

It&#39;s a private contract between you and a service provider that basically says you both promise not to sue each other in court for anything that happens as a result of your business transaction. Instead you agree to have any disputes settled privately by an &#34;arbiter&#34; (usually a retired judge somewhere), the arbiter&#39;s decision is final, and there&#39;s no way to appeal.
</p>
<p>
Most big companies nowadays hide arbitration agreements in their Terms of Service to protect themselves from getting sued by unhappy customers. This is the first time I&#39;ve heard of a medical provider demanding one though...

She&#39;s at the forefront of the ppv technique and that comes with a lot of risk on her end.

is this nina :0 i just  had mine and it feels good but honestly it&#39;s starting to separate and i don&#39;t know WHt to expect but apparently it&#39;s normal and it will just heal but i thought it looked pretty but apparently i was looking at swelling and incisions?? and the way it heals is like different from the way it looks all stitched up but for some reason i didn&#39;t expect that AT ALL my brain was just like: this is how it&#39;s supposed to look forever minus the tiny stitch marks. but apparently it changes as it heals like. one side of it kinda separated from the other so idk how it&#39;s even gonna look lmao but i&#39;m not too worried now? it felt so good and tight but now it&#39;s not :c but apparently that&#39;s supposed to happen i&#39;m just so sad that it couldn&#39;t heal all tight how it was. but apparently this happens with over 60% of patients.

Damn, I was planning on going to her. Guess I&#39;ll have to find someone else :(

I don&#39;t like the idea of possibly getting butchered and having no legal recourse.

FWIW, I&#39;ve lived in CA my whole life, and arbitration agreements are standard before getting seen. It&#39;s not something unique to her practice.
