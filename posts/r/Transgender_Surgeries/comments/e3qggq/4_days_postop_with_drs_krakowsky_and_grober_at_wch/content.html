Dear diary... (This is a much more stream of consciousness entry than previous)
</p>
<p>
Despite being on my feet and sitting down today, I&#39;m far less exhausted and worn than yesterday. I got my first large blocks of sleep since surgery (a pair of 3 hour blocks with a short gap in the middle), so I woke up feeling like I&#39;d actually slept. I also met one of the other women recovering from bottom surgery here over breakfast, and she helped me with what almost feels like a cheat code for sitting down without significant pain! I&#39;d been trying to face forwards on the chair, and using a doughnut cushion to try to offload the perineum. Her suggestion was to sit almost completely sideways on the chair, only one cheek in contact, and to roll up on to that hip and lean against the back of the chair. Holy shit, I can eat and chat without tensing up in pain. Meds after breakfast then and back to my room to rest, chat with my wife, and surf. I had some leakage onto the pad I kept over my vulva last night, mostly from the vestibule with a little from one of the primary incisions, I messaged Emery a photo, and they weren&#39;t worried about that level of bleed overnight, also no signs of separation. Rested in my room and brushed out my hair for the first time since surgery, it feels nice to have my hair down again, the french braids did the job and I only had one moderately knotted section to work through. I had lunch and met the other woman recovering from bottom surgery, we chatted for a while until I discovered that even without the pulling at the incisions, I still have a limit to how long I can be upright before the pressure starts to hurt. Back to my room to rest and cold pack and keep waiting for my body to be ready to poop. Dinner was uneventful, I didn&#39;t meet up with anyone and I ate blissfully pain free. I discovered at some point this afternoon that my tail has grown, some of the packing has started to work its way out and I now have a sizable ~7 inch tail of packing. I was warned that this could happen and that I shouldn&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;ll let Emery know in the morning, and I got one of the nurses to trim it so I can sit on the toilet without it dangling in the water. Still no bowel movement, but I think I&#39;m more feeling mentally ready to poop than physically in need of pooping. I accomplished a lot of relatively mundane things, but the big accomplishment today was that I managed to do pretty much all of them without acute pain or feeling wiped out. My wife and daughter will be visiting tomorrow since I&#39;m feeling up to going down to see them and to sit for a while to visit. :)

By tail do you mean of packing? Were you pushing your packing out or something?
</p>
<p>
Also that’s wonderful that your wife and child are there to support you :)

Yes, that&#39;s exactly what I mean. The packing consists of a long strip of gauze soaked in antibiotic gel and packed inside of me with a short tail hanging out for removal. As I move around and contract/relax my pelvic floor muscles (ie, trying gently to poop), a few inches worked free.
</p>
<p>
The support I&#39;ve been getting from the team at WCH and at arc has been fantastic, but it is absolutely amazing that my wife and daughter are able to be around to visit. They&#39;re staying with her parents, so she&#39;s got support too while I focus on recovery.

Ah ok thanks for clarifying!
</p>
<p>
I’m glad your recovery is so supported, I hope mine goes like that.

You&#39;re welcome.
</p>
<p>
Not all surgeons use a strip of gauze, some use a condom stuffed with gauze or foam which doesn&#39;t have a risk of unraveling, but generally has to be held in place with sutures so it doesn&#39;t shoot out on its own in a similar situation. (I&#39;ve heard the sutures kind of suck given where they&#39;re placed and the way they pull as you move.)
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s, frankly, amazing. Though I may not feel it all the time, I am very limited in how much I can do (both from pain and fatigue) and simple things (like putting on socks or underwear) are actually a challenge. Having people who care that I&#39;m doing well and that are invested in my recovery helps me feel very much not alone and left to struggle, and that lets me be much more relaxed, less stressed out about whether or not anything is going wrong, and much more able to spare some effort to do fun things (like visit with my wife and daughter.)
</p>
<p>
I hope you have a similarly supportive environment for your recovery too. 10/10, would recommend. :)
