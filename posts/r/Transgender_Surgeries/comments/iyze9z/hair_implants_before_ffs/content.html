Hi all, I have a question about hair implants &amp; ffs... I&#39;m interested in getting hair implants to fill out my M-shaped hairline. I&#39;m not sure if ffs is part of my longer-term transition goals or not, but I want to know how this decision would affect it. I know often with forehead work, surgeons will lower patients&#39; hairline as part of the surgery process. I&#39;m wondering if getting hair implants would cause any problems or complications with ffs down the road. Does anyone have any insight?
</p>
<p>
Thank you~

...its usually not a good idea as there can be shock fallout after FFS near the forehead incision site...some Dr.s will do it a week or so after FFS but in the end it is best to speak to any potential surgeons you may be considering for FFS for their best advice...

Does it matter how long it&#39;s been since the transplanting? I&#39;ll be having FFS a full 3 years after my hair transplant, which went awesome.

...i would think that sort of time gap would be fine but only your surgeon will know all the possibilites...

It&#39;s also about hiding the forehead scar. you can get the transplanted hair at and below the scar to hide the leftover scar even more. (Though the scar tends to be &#39;barely there.&#39;)
<br>
I have also had a convo with a surgeon that said if the hair transplant &#39;holes&#39; were poked deep enough, the pinpoint scars left over makes it sightly more difficult to &#39;peel the scalp.&#39;
<br>
O.O  &lt;- my expression at that news.
</p>
<p>
So, definitely talk to the surgeon on this.

My ffs surgeon ( deschamps-braly ) strongly urges to not get hair grafts prior to ffs as there is risk to forehead vascularization which can impact ffs procedures involving the forehead down the line.
</p>
<p>
I do not have any reviewed papers unfortunately validating this - he does expound on his viewpoint on his site however
<a href="https://deschamps-braly.com/facial-feminization-surgery/hair-transplants/" rel="nofollow">https://deschamps-braly.com/facial-feminization-surgery/hair-transplants/
</a>
wherein all the usual caveats regarding non peer reviewed opinion pieces reside.

FFS is basically always recommended first to prevent loss of the transplanted hair
