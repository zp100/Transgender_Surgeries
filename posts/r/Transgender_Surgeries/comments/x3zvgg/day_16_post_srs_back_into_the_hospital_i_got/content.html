I’m so sorry. I was very worried about this but did not want to contradict what your doctor was telling you. I’ve had SRS and a few revisions but have never, ever seen that amount of black tissue on myself or any other post-op. It just wasn’t normal, nor was the long catheter use. I really hope they can fix you up and please keep us posted. Get well soon and please reach out to your emotional support team.

Hugs and good thoughts.  I know that feeling well, having the things you anticipated would be good turn to bad things.  I hope your recovery is smooth as can be and they can get you back out and living your life.

I&#39;ve felt just like this many times in my life. My heart breaks for you. I cant imagine what you&#39;re going through. Im hopeful that modern medicine will work its magic and everything&#39;s OK. 💚💚💚
</p>
<p>
I once hit a drastic low in my life and the only reason I got through it was because I ended up running into someone who picked up on my mental state at the time. That person ended up becoming a friend and they listened to my feelings. I was fortunate that the first support group I ever had found me because I was not looking for them.
</p>
<p>
I know the sadness you must feel is sapping your motivation... but please, push yourself to reach out to others for help and compassion if things get too dark mentally. You will find what you need to get through this by help from our brothers, sisters, and NB siblings all over the world. There are lots of trans support groups out there. It could turn everything around for you. It has for me many times. Talk to your closest friends about how you feel... no matter how scary it can be.
</p>
<p>
&#34;If you&#39;re going through hell, keep going.&#34; I love this quote because it subtly reminds us that you will eventually get on the other side of hell as long as you don&#39;t stop. Time heals all wounds.
</p>
<p>
My thoughts are with you. Stay safe. You&#39;re loved.

Thank you but... I can just cry on the shoulder of my mother. All my friends from my city left me alone and even blocked me. They got mad cause I got mad because no one asked how the surgery went and they said that&#39;s how they are and with my Instagram histories they though oh okay she is fine no need to ask. So now I only have friends from other cities, I can&#39;t cry and except from my mother I can&#39;t express myself and hug someone...

Maybe make your righteous moral stand in a different thread. This one is for comforting OP while they recover.

Thank you... Yeah, I thought that the words of the surgeon who did the surgery where the real ones and my head was on a mental state that told me: nothing can&#39;t go wrong... It&#39;s normal... And I didn&#39;t have pain just uncomfortable and I thought it was the normal thing and that I was recovering fast cause I could sit for a long time without being uncomfortable. But the day that they would remove my catheter they sent me to urgencies... And then they told me that I have necrosis.... I was crying because I thought that for one time in my life things could be better... But no, now I&#39;m again in the hospital and need a new surgery and more days at the hospital... I&#39;m just hanging on a little rope...

I&#39;m so sorry this is happening to you. I wish I could offer more than support from a stranger. I know you&#39;re hanging on by just a little rope but I believe in you. You&#39;re hanging on and that&#39;s something to be proud of.

Stay strong, sister. You&#39;re absolutely not alone in dealing with this, and you won&#39;t be along healing from it either. I dealt with necrosis too. Recovery isn&#39;t a straight line and sometimes there&#39;s setbacks like this. It&#39;s painful and gross and embarrassing but more importantly than that, it is temporary. You will see the other side of this and be better for it. Sending you love

I had necrosis as well, it&#39;s a fairly common complication. It was a bit yuck, but in the end wasn&#39;t a big problem. You&#39;ll pull through, it will be ok.

I saw the earlier posts and was concerned.   Now the best thing to do is rest, let the doctors do their thing.  Sending a big hug from the Pocono mountains in Pennsylvania.♥️

I&#39;m really sorry this happened to you! It must feel really devastating
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, necrosis is not a new thing under the sun. Some people get it, it is treated and they get better.

What is everything?

<p>
That you&#39;ll need to be back in the hospital while they treat the necrosis? Do you have a treatment plan?

You’re gonna make it. Hang in there sweetie. This will pass. You will recover. You’ll look back in two years and be sooooo grateful you went through it. Keep reaching out for support. Keep crying. Keep doing what the doctor says. You can do this ❤️

It seems completely unnecessary to me that if I am asking a question to someone who lives in my country, I have to ask it in a language that is not spoken in my country. If I use the translator you can use it too, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s not that complicated.
</p>
<p>
All this without taking into account that the questions I am going to ask to she, you will not be able to understand them because our health system is completely different from yours, but if you don&#39;t know how to use the translator, I will translate it for you.

Yeah, the problem is that you are deleting my comment for being in another language or in other words, you are discriminating against me and all Spanish community because of the language I speak and that is not allowed on Reddit.

Ale, ready, I have already written to her by private message and thanks to you instead of promoting diversity and bringing clear benefits to the community, it is something that is lost by limiting it to a single language.

You have no idea the amount of hate this community attracts everyday, not to mention all the chasers. There&#39;s 57 accounts that have been banned in the last week, and that&#39;s on top of the thousands before that. As I explained in the prior post it is necessary. If you don&#39;t like it you can make your own sub with whatever rules you think best - its the reddit way.

It costs nothing to put more moderators who can speak more than one language and not force a lot of people to use a translator that, from experience, does not work. More than anything because for example in Spanish, we distinguish perfectly the feminine from the masculine and there are many words and expressions that the translator takes them as masculine. A person who has a good level of English will be able to correct it, but a person who barely knows English will be constantly misgendering all the girls. Something that could be solved with moderators who know how to speak more languages.

I had similar issues with my surgery, the skin graft failed and died inside the vagina. It was a long recovery, but it worked out in the end. Stay positive, it may seem like a lot now, but it will work out.

As everyone else already said, the doctor/surgeon will fix you, this is not an insurmountable obstacle to get over even though it may feel like that right now. Also keep in mind surgeries like this are very taxing on the body and will usually cause post op depression. I had FTM top surgery a few months ago and the post op depression was so insane I wanted to kill myself, but now that it’s passed it’s weird to looked back and think wow how did that happen?! Day 16 after SRS is not long at all since surgery, so you have a lot of time to heal back after they fix the necrosis. Necrosis is really scary on any part of the body but you will more than likely be fine. Just keep reminding yourself that post op depression is a thing and try to distract yourself with something you like as much as possible. ❤️❤️

Things happen and you will get stronger.  What do they say they have to do?   I thought your surgeon had seen it and said ok.  Guess I was mistaken.  You are a tough independent woman, all of us your sisters are pulling for you .  Charlie

You’ll get through this, I know you will, complications happen and that’s okay, I’m sure that they’ll save the remaining tissue as much as they can. As long as it works, there’s nothing to worry about. Appearance isn’t everything btw, all vaginas look weird already lol

Huge hugs!  As scary as it is, its not the end of the world.  You will loose some tissue down there.  But some tissue loss post GRS is common.  The big thing is they get the necrosis under control and remove the damaged tissue so you&#39;re back to just healthy tissue.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately your pictures looked like they left you with quiet a bit of extra tissue.  Worst case they get it all cleaned up and you have to get a revision for a slightly more dainty but still beautiful vagina.  Reguardless all hope is not lost, you will be okay.  You just are going to have a bit longer recovery than others!
</p>
<p>
Huge huggles!  You will get through this!

I&#39;m so sorry. It will get better. You will at the very least heal. A lot of people need revisions so you are not alone there if you end up needing revision surgeries. Hang in there, stay hydrated and eat well.

You&#39;re going to be okay honey. We all believe in you. I&#39;m very sad that you have to go through this. Having to get another surgery and having necrosis fucking sucks. I know the post-op depression and suicidal thoughts are extremely tough to deal with, but I promise you, after you start healing up physically, you will learn to heal up mentally aswell and I am convinced that you will recover from this. You&#39;re so strong. Even if you don&#39;t feel like it right now, you truly are. Hang in there❤️

Girl your story brings me to tears as I have been thru some hard crap before.
</p>
<p>
I know in this time there isn’t much that I can say that can help.
</p>
<p>
But the strength that you had bringing you to this point is not something to discard. Meaning that it is who you are and if you focus on it and believe it. You will be up again. New techniques and advances are put in place and discovered even faster now.
</p>
<p>
Have faith that this is not the end but simply a bump. I get it’s unwanted and undeserved. But you live in a time where soon there will probably be things that will be able to fix it.

So the task ahead will be hard to focus on all the positive in your lives rather than on this. But there is a good story at the end. I am sure of it.

Mate so sorry this happened to ya. Who is your doctor?

Previous comment on a separate post claimed you had a scab, 14 days with catheter is normal….all liars!!

Sorry to rrport but whatever is affected by necrosis will not comeback. The surrounding tissue around your urethra is affected. Try hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Only known thing to stop its progression.

Your resuult looks very much a Dr Rumer result. Sue.

Hang in there. We’re all wanting the best for you. You’re in the safest place possible and make sure the doctors are doing what’s best for you - even if you have to fight for it.

Girl, quicker than you know it you&#39;re gonna heal and one day not long I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be enjoying yourself, maybe even with someone else.  We&#39;ve got hard lives and maybe even crazy shit like this to deal with but we&#39;re fucking changing the world for the better just by existing. We&#39;re powerful. You&#39;re part of this ❤️

It&#39;s dangerous, irreversible and should be treated ASAP.
