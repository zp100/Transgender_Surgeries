After months of work and decades of knowing I don’t want children, I had an orchiectomy last week.
</p>
<p>
At first I felt a peace and was glad it was done. Now, 6 days in, I feel bad about it. I have this anxious bad feeling when I think of what’s happened, even though I still don’t want children. My mind is making up scenarios like “what if in the future they can resurrect you from your descendants dna” and “what if you unexpectedly want bio kids after this hormone shift” and “what if my eternal salvation is gone?” and “why did you do this, what dysphoria?” These are strange thoughts but they feel very important right now. Plus I’m not religious.
</p>
<p>
I also have a weird sad and anxious feeling when I notice they are gone. This is what distresses me most, I had such a peace about it early on and pre surgery. They caused so much pain and anguish in my life, why do I feel conflicted now that it’s done?
</p>
<p>
Would anyone share how their post op depression felt? I’m afraid I made a mistake. This feeling completely blindsided me after years of transition, I don’t understand it. I’m hoping it’s just post op depression, but I can’t tell from where I’m at now.

I had an orchi years ago and I&#39;ve had multiple surgeries since then and I get depressed following anesthesia and surgeries in general. I&#39;m not sure that is what you&#39;re going through but I&#39;d definitely give it more time. After FFS I was a mess but I&#39;d do it all over again if I had to. Take care of yourself in the short term and wait a bit.

Thank you for this advice. I will try to wait it out, and focus on recovery.

This is really familiar to me, especially the reasons for not wanting biochildren, and the thoughts on adoption. Hopefully I will settle down soon and find the positives you are experiencing. I do have reduced genital dysphoria too, so much so that I am already forgetting the frustrations and pains. Maybe it’ll be better too once I am healed enough to do normal things again, and really see the practical impact.
</p>
<p>
Edit: they did not have me stop HRT. My t level were at top range, though, so I’m hoping that hormone shift has a lot to do with this and will correct over time.

I know it&#39;s not the same, but my experience as a trans masc person after top surgery was pretty similar emotionally. I felt relieved the first few days, and was absolutely sure I wanted surgery beforehand. Sometime during recovery though, I think a week or two in, I definitely had a reaction of feeling a lot of confusion, depression, and not quite regret but anxiety and fear. I remember distinctly having a crying breakdown in my backyard, and honestly it helped to let myself get hysterical and feel all those feelings. They&#39;re just emotions, emotions come and go like clouds sometimes, and my emotional weather shifted back to it&#39;s norms after I let myself experience those moments. It doesn&#39;t make you less trans, and it isn&#39;t abnormal. You lived parts of your body for years and now they&#39;re gone, it&#39;s okay to have any amount of mixed feelings about that. Sometimes the immense strain the body is under during recovery, or how some bodies react to anesthesia or pain medications, can definitely intensify those feelings. Trust you knew yourself well enough when you made the decision for this surgery, and it&#39;s okay to have some spikes in your emotional weather as you&#39;re in the vulnerable recovery phase.

This was extremely helpful to hear that it is okay to feel this way and to trust myself. I had a good cry session after reading it. :)

I haven’t got my surgery yet but maybe you are so used to dysphoria that now as it’s gone you have problems justifying this procedure to yourself.
</p>
<p>
I think that it’s okay to feel a loss over a body part that you had for your whole life. It was always there with you and now that it’s gone I can understand that you feel… sad. I have really bad dysphoria but I know that after surgery I will be melancholic about this.
</p>
<p>
Let yourself be sad about this. While it totally reliefs your dysphoria it’s not coming without drawbacks. Now that you know with certainty that you will never have biological children it makes sense to feel the way you feel. And that’s okay. It will get better I’m sure. :)

Thank you, I will try to let the time pass and focus on recovery. I never thought I’d feel any negative about losing that organ so this has been quite a wild ride.

That’s great to hear. My surgery date is in March and one of my bigger fears is post op depression and some kind of regret during recovery.
</p>
<p>
Was there anything special that helped you to maintain a good mental health the weeks after surgery?

Hey I’m a trans man who had a full hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (everything “female” gone) about 8 months ago.
</p>
<p>
I always knew I NEVER wanted to carry a biological child. Mostly for dysphoria reasons. I always told myself if I got preg I would off myself. Luckily I never had to deal with that (surprisingly). I know one day it would be nice to adopt an older child to get them out of the system and into a safe, loving home. Since older children/teens are usually just stuck until they’re old enough to leave on their own. But anyways, directly after my hysto, I immediately felt all this weight lifted off my shoulders. To this day, my bipolar and PTSD are more manageable due to hormones no longer clashing in my body. However, for a month or two after the initial month post op.. I found myself saddened and afraid that one day, I might have wanted to use my eggs, even if not to carry a child myself, someone else could for me. I feel like it’s honestly just the brains way of recognizing that having biological children is something you can’t do anymore. It’s hard wired into our brains to WANT to have kids, and some cis people never have thoughts of wanting kids until they learn they can’t. It just fucks with your brain.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, it would make me very happy to have a bio kid or two with my partner (MtF).. but it’s not something we can ever do. She doesn’t want kids because she has a genetic disorder that is very debilitating as well as skeletal issues.. it’s not something either of us would feel good passing onto someone who has no choice of being born into this world. Along with that, I have multiple serious mental health issues, along with type one diabetes that both my brother and my half brother also have. It just doesn’t feel right putting that all onto a kid who didn’t ask to be born.

Then do some soul searching and figure out why your dna being passed on matters. There is nothing wrong with adoption... to quote Mewtwo

I think that for a lot of us (myself included) adoption isn&#39;t really an option due to history of mental disorders (and no, I don&#39;t include being transgender there, I think more about depression and so on). There are sperm banks though.

You just rocked your endocrine system. You&#39;ll have some lethargy for sure. It can feel depressing during this time, but you&#39;ll bounce back.

I&#39;m curious to know your age? I&#39;m 55 and have never had children and gave up on that decades ago plus I never wanted any other than for selfish reasons for someone to put flowers on my grave but I&#39;ve come to terms with that now also and am speeding right along on HRT right behind you and can not wait until srs and to me this is the most correct thing I feel I have ever done in my life and haven&#39;t looked back. And my T=0 zero which I need to bring up a few points so I know having absolutely zero T hasn&#39;t changed a thing with how I feel other than all good stuff and maybe to you you reached the point of no return and that&#39;s mind fkg you a little bit and for me I feel like I had better hurry up and get on with this before I reached an age to achieve transition and now that&#39;s all I strive for. I have heard no matter how prepared you are for GSR of any kind you will have a degree of post op depression and this has been from DR&#39;s saying to expect this because it will happen to some degree and some people will have it more than others but to hang in there and report it to the Dr. And you will get past it.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there girl, talk to your Dr. If need be they expect this and are prepared to help you get through this don&#39;t be the tuff girl on your own.  Praying for you. Thanks for sharing that shows strength in itself.
