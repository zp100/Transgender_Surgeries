They look like tiny scars from your sutures to me. Been there. ðŸ˜Š By the way, your surgeon did a masterpiece. She&#39;s beautiful.

I apologize for the late reply! Thank you! The surgeon is very pleased with the results, and so am I.
</p>
<p>
With that said, I&#39;m still having various diffuse symptoms around the pelvic girdle, and no one has been able to figure out why. The surgeon couldn&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary, and told me that my problems were unlikely a direct complication from the surgery, as far as he could tell.
</p>
<p>
Truthfully, there might not be a singular cause to my problem, but rather a bunch of convergent symptoms, like muscle imbalances and pelvic floor weakness. But I can probably say now that a cutaneous fistula isn&#39;t one of them.

Look like suture scars, or possibly old ingrown hair scars. Definitely not something I would worry about, and look nothing like a fistula, no are they in a place you could reasonably have a fistula exit.

As someone who gets many ingrown hairs it is definitely looking more like that.

My thought was something along the lines as pilonidal sinus, with a dilated follicle acting as a fistula opening. But yeah, I can now probably safely say it is just a pair of dimpled follicles.

Definitely not. Could be suture marks or ingrowns. I have these same things  on my Arm ( ftm rff phallo)  and they are like little indents and when I squeeze them, a tiny bit of pus comes out. Either way, not a fistula.
