A relatively minor operation in the scale of operations. I would estimate 4 to 6 weeks before things are back to normal pain wise however there maybe the odd lingering stab now and then. Firm compression bandage and dissolveable sutures. 24 hrs resting and then slow mobilisation. Should be up and walking with some discomfort after 1 day.

As I mentioned whilst everyone is different, providing you are healthy, 4 to six weeks for the incision to heal. Sex after that should be fine, just take it easy and &#34;If pain persists, see your doctor&#34;.

I had one about a month ago. Honestly, there wasnt any issues... It was easy. Didnt even take the narcotics, just alternate tylenol/motrin for 24 hours. Got up the next day and took a 2 hour plane flight.
