Hi,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trans nonbinary and born as a male. I recently had an orchiectomy and what&#39;s called a cavernosal artery dilation/destruction (basically, I can&#39;t get hard anymore). Anyway, I have plans this summer to get a full vaginoplasty, but I will be honest....I am a bit unattracted to the end result. I keep seeing all these pics of surgeries, but I find the vagina strange looking in most cases. I want it to look clean and not have any scaring..but 95% of the photos I find all have pretty pronounced scaring and lots of asymetries. Am I being unrealistic? Does anyone end up with little pronounced scaring? Also, does anyone have what&#39;s called a &#34;barbie vagina?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Also, I wanted to kind of bring up the fact that in the end I can honestly see myself being nullified, but I wanted to give myself the opportunity to try something new. Being enby, I know more about how I don&#39;t identify than with what I do...and I don&#39;t really see vaginas and penises as &#34;male&#34; or &#34;female.&#34; I see them as more expressions of our energies...and I am definitely a receiving energy. I want the opportunity to have unrestricted and impulsive romantic engagements where I am not hindered by the trip to a shower to &#34;clean out&#34; which often can kill the mood. I also want to feel a ying/yang type connection during sex where we become one and our pleasure is mutual and fully from the same place and actions. Has anyone else felt this way?
</p>

Regarding scaring, yes you&#39;re being unrealistic. They can fade over time and with some treatments but there will almost certainly be scaring.

There’s lots of info and photos on vaginoplasty in the wiki here.
</p>
<p>

The quality of the end result is in large part dependant on the skill of the surgeon.  Asymmetry can be difficult to achieve in the primary surgery, but can be fixed in a revision, assuming there’s enough material available. Most surgeons have difficulty with labia, so getting a barbie look with small/no labia should be easier.

Over the years I’ve seen a number of people ask if a procedure exists to stop erections, but this is the first I’ve ever heard of one. Could you elaborate on this more as I’d like to add this post to the wiki. It may help others in the future.
</p>
<p>
i.e. who was your surgeon, what was recovery like, do you have any links to resources on this procedure, how did you find out about it?

Since OP has not responded yet, Ive reached out to a urologist to ask if this is possible. This seems like a promising lead though:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673808/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673808/
</a>
</p>
<p>
In this study, they treat ED by restricting bloodflow to a pseudoaneurysm (caused by blunt force trauma) . Maybe you could use something like a microcoil, stent, or gelfoam to restrict bloodflow to the carvernosal arteries making erections impossible. It also seems like these sort of interventions are relatively routine, and priapism has its own set of interventions that might be applicable as well.
</p>
<p>
Even if this isnt how OP achieved their outcome, I&#39;m now convinced that this is extremely possible.

That urologist...here lol!
</p>
<p>
I left a reply to OP but will reply here.  I also had not seen transcutaneous bilateral ablation of the cavernosal artery used as an option before but it make ALOT OF SENSE.  Minimally invasive and effective for those that desire it.  This is generally done by &#34;interventional radiologists&#34;, who generally have lots of experience in ablating arteries. The biggest barrier will be if any individual center is trans-friendly enough to get it done for you.  Centers anywhere who will not be fussed by using an artery ablation in a new way (for them at least) should be able to to it.

I tried searching and didn&#39;t find anything, but there was lots on the opposite. It definitely seems feasible.

Thank you for sharing!
</p>
<p>
Am a urologist and full time transgender surgeon. I had not heard of (bilateral) cavernosal artery ablation but it seems like an elegant plan to eliminate penile blood flow that causes erections. I know it can be done by interventional radiologists through a small catheter placed into your artery through the skin, in what might be very low impact for the patient.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think that ASYMMETRY should be a big part of your proposed vaginoplasty. Most patients in my experience do not have noted asymmetry. As has been stated before, scars ARE a part of this and every operation but they seem to flatten and fade to barely noticeable in most patients.
</p>
<p>
You can talk to your surgeon about what exact surgery you want. If you want full vaginoplasty (make a vulva and vagina) or just a &#34;vulvoplasty&#34; (zero depth vaginoplasty), or a &#34;nullo&#34; type operation where the penis and scrotum is removed, or even a mix of those.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in your journey.....

I can definitely relate to feeling anxious about aesthetics and scarring, it is my biggest hang up in moving forward with srs. This resource,
<a href="http://gynodiversity.com/uploads/Classification_of_the_anatomical_variation_in_female_external_genitalia.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://gynodiversity.com/uploads/Classification_of_the_anatomical_variation_in_female_external_genitalia.pdf
</a>
, has really helped me in my process. Spending hours on end looking at srs results has really trained my eyes to search for &#34;imperfections&#34;, and often leaves me feeling really discouraged about srs. Its been helpful remind myself that cis vulvas rarely look &#34;aesthetically perfect&#34; either.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in your decision making :)
