Oh wow, I think this is the most healed SRS picture shared on this sub! I hope those 10 years have been worthwhile and there hasn’t been too much trouble. You and Dr. Chettawut did a great job!

Thank you, no troubles at all. Not that I really care too much but shouldn&#39;t the labia connect at the bottom?

In my opinion, it&#39;s kind of complex. In the picture you posted, I didn&#39;t really notice the lack of a fourchette, and I have seen vaginas on cis women that do not have a fourchette so I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s not automatically an out of place thing. That being said, the lack of a fourchette is a &#34;distinctive&#34; trait of trans vaginas, I think it&#39;s related to dilation (I&#39;d imagine that with some techniques it could be hard to stretch your vaginal opening and your labia when you&#39;re newly post-op) as well as the fact that surgeons probably have more pressing things to do in one stage vaginoplasty. It can be revised if you want though, [here](
<a href="https://www.mozaiccare.net/dr-adam-bonnington">https://www.mozaiccare.net/dr-adam-bonnington</a>
) is a doctor who I think is pretty good at revisions, he had a really good before and after on this site but it looks like he removed it, regardless it can give you an idea of what can be done. This was kind of a non-answer, but I hope it was still helpful!

Yet another deleted wiki link. Want to pull my hair out.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m close to a point where I just wanna walk somewhere random and say fuck me up. It seems to be luck based. And there&#39;s no info. And I&#39;m just unlucky anyways.

I often see post-op results posted here which bear little resemblance to a cis vagina.  THIS one is not such a vagina.  This is one of the best, most visually correct results I&#39;ve ever seen.  Truly a visual masterpiece.

I agree. Actually looks a lot like a vulva/vagina of a woman who has had a baby or two (I’m a nurse).

Thank you for posting this! I had surgery with Dr. Chettawut almost 10 weeks ago.  I’m hoping my results look as great as yours.
</p>
<p>
If you don’t mind sharing, how was your healing process? What’s your dilation regimen as of now?  Have there been things you’ve noticed over the years?  What has your experience been like in terms of self-lubrication and penetrative sex?  Any advice to offer newcomers?
</p>
<p>
Thank you again for sharing your results!

The healing process was tough. I think I didn&#39;t have full strength back until 6 months post-op and you just feel a slave to the dilation regimen. Definitely one of the hardest things I&#39;ve been through.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t dilate at all anymore, maybe once in a blue moon just to confirm that it&#39;s still possible. But one of the main reasons is that I&#39;ve never really been able to have satisfying penetrative sex due to only starting out with 3.5&#34; of depth. I tried my best to keep that depth for the first few years but later the effort just didn&#39;t seem worth it anymore. It&#39;s not completely gone and I could probably regain it with a bit of effort but I don&#39;t see the point. It&#39;s not like vaginal penetration is very satisfying either, to me it just feels like needing to pee.
</p>
<p>
The lack of depth was not the surgeon&#39;s fault, it was dangerous to try and go deeper due to bad scarring on my urethra which made it very brittle and difficult to separate from the surrounding tissue as he explained. He tried, I was in surgery for 9 hours. The urethral issue was due to an anatomical issue I had since my teenage years, called vesicoureteral reflux, which led to frequent UTI and kidney infections. Post-op I never had those problems again. But it does mean that I need to have sex in other ways. Sensation and lubrication is excellent. I was able to orgasm like a week or two after surgery already and I need to put on clean underwear after arousal because it gets really wet.

Week or two!! 🙉 I hoped that was possible. I wanna go to (more) med school or intern  wherevever you doc(s) trained on that technique, if you happen to know. STELLAR! Of course it may have just been you and your body knowing what it was doing from the escape-from-[vesicoreflux+cisdysgenderism] get-go...
</p>
<p>
The last sentence (and that whole paragraph) was exactly what i wanted to know. since the pic is gone, may i ask what procedure type and details, given the lubrication contentment, and two last questions: did the  (1) AMOUNT of sexorgasm-times per average week, say, you wantedgave yourselves noticeably change between pre-op and post 1-2 weeks post op (before slavery to dialation or other factors may have interfered?) ; and (2) if or if not the arousal to orgasm geographic focussedness and lube characteristics are different (i.e. did you lube a lot before, precumwise, and did the amount of pleasure further away from the main main frenulumclit-like spot or spots vs when focussing just ontop of itthem, making the rythm or pattern of a masterbative session differen in any easy to explain way(s)?
</p>
<p>
Before med, was in a sexology and surrogacy career, and still train counselors... so I ask for us all. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
any thing you&#39;d like to add* is also appreciated, even if it woul just be more icing on the cake-i-mean-pie,🙂
