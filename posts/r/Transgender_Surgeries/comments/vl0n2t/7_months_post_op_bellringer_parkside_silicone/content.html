The granulation at the base was only treated once and has healed tight causing pain dilating and issues cleaning and urinating.
</p>
<p>
I have been using silicone scar strips for months and while it looks better for several hours after removing them it just returns looking crap afterwards. I have been massaging the scars but couldn&#39;t for the first two months as thew were too painful. They now have hard bits that feel like bumps under the skin.
</p>
<p>
I have very little clitoral sensation and not enough to climax, g-spot stimulation just winds me up and pain all the way up the vaginal vault when dilating. Takes 10 minutes to get to depth each time, doesn&#39;t matter what size dilator. I can&#39;t even get my finger in it unless I&#39;m wearing latex gloves and use a lot of lube.
</p>
<p>
Non existent pain management while in hospital has left me with serious mental health issues.
</p>
<p>
Yes I have complained and seeing a different surgeon to hopefully fix at least some of my problems. If it was up to me I would rip the whole lot out and start again.
</p>
<p>
Bellringer said I was in surgery for two hours. That was a lie, on my records is clearly stated I was only in the OR for 75 minutes.
</p>
<p>
If you want to take the risk that he just can&#39;t be bothered on the day you are in go ahead.
</p>
<p>
Oh and please don&#39;t hug-box me or point out &#39;but the labia look great&#39; I&#39;m not blind. I hate the scarring.

Oh dear, we had same issues dilating. Those seem like keloid scarring?
</p>
<p>
NO matter what dilator, it tooks me 10 or sometimes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. Lots of lube.
</p>
<p>
8 months post-op still struggling Dilating 2x day. I had to star treatment with Psychiatrist due to my mind being unstable all the time and now hoping the drugs help me to recover half of what I was.
</p>
<p>
I must say that my anxiety (gad) came in childhood, depression when I was a teenager, now both increased and the SRS boosted both to dangerous extreme. I was just great, fully happy with my bills, vagina and all, but 2 months ago, lost sensation in saddle area and my spine it&#39;s weird, weak legs and having diarrhea. Exactly how I g felt the first 2 weeks post surgery.
</p>
<p>
But i can&#39;t believe I was SO GREAT, and then so bad. Maybe my personality disorder is the component that complicated it all.
</p>
<p>
A long hug for ya...hope the best for you to happen!

My aesthetician is adamant scars can be pretty much erased with laser, might be worth a try??
