Did you have loose skin  after your weight loss? Did you get full depth or minimal? If full, did you have any complications?
</p>
<p>
It seems I&#39;m in the minority looking at the age and weight of most of the transitioners here. I&#39;ll be 45 in August and I started estrogen when I was 36. I believe when I started hormones I was about 395 lbs, down from my highest weight ever of 435. I had to twist my Doctor&#39;s arm to get her to prescribe them. Recently I found a medication that finally allows me control my diabetes very well and lose much of my excess weight. Since July, I&#39;ve gone from a starting weight of 365 down to 237.
</p>
<p>
I recently determined that SRS was a covered benefit on my insurance and I&#39;m currently planning on having full depth PIV SRS in early December with the understanding that I would reach at least the weight the surgeon requires which is 210. Doctor keeps subtly pushing me towards minimal depth because of the increased complications of full depth, but I want what I want. That is if I can get it minimal complications.
</p>
<p>
If you were obese before your surgery please DM me I&#39;d love to get your experiences regarding any complications, healing issues, etc that you experienced.

Also, at risk of lacking reddiquette, why are people downvoting this? Fatphobic? I&#39;m bettering myself. I&#39;ve lost almost 130 lbs.

I&#39;ve had more requests for my tale, so rather than copy paste in everyone&#39;s DMs I&#39;ll just paste it here, top level. I&#39;m okay after all the traumas, but there are some things us larger ladies need to know. You are valid, and the surgeries you need to put you right are tricky and fraught with peril. But the surgeons we vet are trusted and have experience, and they expect a measure of work on your part to help yourself heal.
</p>
<p>
I know how hard weight loss is, and maintaining the new weight is literally a life altering experience.
</p>
<p>
I had SRS at age 60, I weighed about 270 with a BMI of 34, and I had complications. I went minimal depth because of unrelated reasons, and I have not regretted any step or decision.
</p>
<p>
My complication was this: I had serious wound separation after two weeks, which led to an artery separating and hemorrhagic shock. Luckily I was close to the ER and the original surgeon was on call, and I&#39;m healing fine. A few weeks later my urethra closed and they gave me a supra-pubic catheter; I wore this for two months, until I had urethroplasty to repair it. Again,I&#39;m healing fine.
</p>
<p>
The impressions are hey, I&#39;m old and fat, the surgeon didn&#39;t do it right, I didn&#39;t follow recovery instructions, but none of these made sense. My groin tissues had seen a LOT of punishment in my life, and it&#39;s more than likely the surgeon could not anticipate that severity, in spite of their experience and training; In short, I still trust them to work on me and others. I did follow instructions, I even had a carer experienced with recovering trans women.
</p>
<p>
Another decision you have is full or minimal depth (0-D). In some cases, 0-D can be extended into full depth, but the initial loss of tissue makes that difficult. The benefit of 0-D though, is I never have to dilate, and healing time is way shorter.

My doctor informed me that being overweight for your surgery actually causes better results and healing. Being morbidly obese can cause it’s own issues of course, however I am 250lbs, 5’10, considered morbidly obese by BMI standards at around 34-35. I just posted my results. I’m day 7 post op and my bandages and all came off today. My doctor says my healing is going perfectly so far, no complications whatsoever, textbook results.

Did you get full or minimal depth? Looks great btw! My doctor is more concerned about my lose skin from rapid weight loss than anything else.

I went for full depth, the first time dilating was only 3.5 or so inches, but my doctor wants me to take the depth training nice and slow for now. Thank you very much (:

First time I heard that, and I don’t believe it’s true. A bit worrying he said that actually.

He informed me that being over a 35 BMI is when the issues occur, the way he initially explained it made a lot of sense. He said if I were to be over a 35, then I would’ve had to lose weight for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
While I appreciate the comment, my surgeon has multiple awards including a best surgeon 2021, and I think I will take my advice from an entire team with Medical degrees.

Let’s please normalize not giving people unsolicited medical advice. I came here to offer support, I already had my surgery and I’m currently healing. I’ve seen nothing but incredible results and amazing stories from my doctor and his team, I already stated I did not want any medical advice, yet you still seem to be trying to push an agenda. Yes being obese and morbidly obese have many issues, and can cause many issues with any medical problems, just as being underweight can, however with all of the misinformation, bias, and fatphobes on here, and in the medical field, I am comfortable with the medical advice I have received. Once again unless you have a medical degree, I am all good.

Dr. John Whitehead of Miami Florida, they have an in-house surgical suite and everything which was very convenient, and way less invasive and expensive. Also guaranteed trusted and specifically picked medical staff. The medical center is Restore Medical Center.

What are your thoughts on loose skin? Have you heard of anyone that has dealt with that after a large weight loss and prior to their bottom surgery? I&#39;m planning to be down to 200 lbs, hopefully 195 by my surgery date but the loose skin is what has me the most worried.

Yes, someone posted about having a problem due to tummy tuck procedure and srs, but I don’t recall what it was or what order the surgeries were in. Maybe it’s in the wiki.

I got really lucky. Metformin had stopped working and was making me sick so my Doctor tried me on Ozempic and it not only helped my sugar but I started eating MUCH LESS effortlessly. When Ozempic became in short supply she switched me to Mounjaro which is a little bit better and I&#39;ve been eating ~1450 calories a day without feeling deprived at all.

I know a few people have already asked, but if you have any information about this, I&#39;d like to request a DM too 🙂. I actually have GRS booked in about 10 days so it&#39;s too late to do anything about it, but I&#39;ve lost almost 100lbs in the last 6 months, and I have a significant amount of loose skin down below, and a frustratingly fatty upper pubic area (grr, it&#39;s a lot better, but it&#39;s so stubborn!). I couldn&#39;t find much information from people in the same position but if there&#39;s anything I need to look out for or anything I can do to help my recovery I&#39;d appreciate it. Cheers

Currently at 210, down from a maximum of 300. I have some issues with saggy stomach skin and redundant outer labia. No complications from SRS per se, but the extra labia skin is annoying and flappy, and I&#39;m hoping to get it corrected as part of a medial thighplasty. Also scheduled for a tummy tuck in August which will hopefully take some of the flappiness out of my fupa.

I was obese for my height at 210 like 5 years ago, besides having hella thigh stretch marks and maybe a bit of extra stubborn fat around my labia majora/tummy there’s no sign of it. All the loose skin fixed itself and dudes seem to be attracted to thigh stretch marks so sure whatever it’s ok IG.

I had surgery at 135, the topic of being formerly obese when I was like 20 never even came up. I did gain back about 10 pounds post-op but I think this is mostly water weight from stopping spiro.

I started having fat redistribution to my butt and hips after surgery so I am planning to do liposuction on my tummy upper torso to get rid of the remaining stubborn fat once that quits doing its thing.
