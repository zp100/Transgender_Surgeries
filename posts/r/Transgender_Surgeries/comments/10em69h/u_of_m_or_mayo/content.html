I hope to not scare the others in here, but I was told by my doctor, one of the more popular trans providers in the Twin Cities, that the Mayo doesnt have the best record. I would avoid that to be honest.
</p>
<p>
My friend had revision surgery at the UMN and had a good experience so theres that!

I&#39;m going thru mayo, currently getting laser hair removal and trying to lose enough weight. Their team seems really friendly and the surgeon knowledgeable though he has fellows assisting. I know a couple people that had surgery there and had minor complications but amazing results.

You need to do electrolysis. Laser is not permanent.

Yep. I think the necrosis and hypergranulation is just bad luck. I hope I won&#39;t need to be put under for another electrocautery session.
</p>
<p>
Did you end up doing a vaginoplasty revision? How was your FFS at Mayo?
</p>
<p>
Sharaf/Bite will be doing mine this year. I&#39;m getting my brow bone, chin, and upper rhinoplasty done. Already doing botox into my hypertrophic masseter muscles.
</p>
<p>
Did they make you stop HRT? They want me to stop HRT because they say it increases blood clot risk. I don&#39;t understand why this would be a problem now when I have gone through orchiectomy, breast augmentation, and SRS (+ revision) with HRT.

Yea I got a revision with RBL which went great except for some granulation tissue in the canal that I&#39;ve had scraped twice so far and will need to do again. My GP said I had hair in my canal just before my revision, but I asked RBL about it and she said I didn&#39;t have any. 🤷‍♀️
</p>
<p>
FFS with mayo kinda sucked. They refused to do the upper and lower halves of my face at the same time so I went with chin, jaw, and adam&#39;s apple. It looks better, but they weren&#39;t as aggressive as I&#39;d like them to be- which may be my fault since I didn&#39;t convey that super well. I&#39;m scheduling a consult with Mardi soon though to do a type 3 and revise my chin/jaw.
</p>
<p>
RBL didn&#39;t make me stop HRT, but I think mayo did for both FFS and GRS- but it&#39;s been so long I can&#39;t honestly remember.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully things are better for you now with GRS, and best of luck with FFS 🙏

I know this is a 10 month old post, but leaving this here for anybody who comes afterwards looking for answers.
</p>
<p>
I had bottom surgery with Dr Martinez in September of 2022. And by god it&#39;s been a mess.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s start with surgical followup. I had hypergranulation tissue issues that I&#39;ve been dealing with for over a year now. Two minor OR visits and dozens of silver nitrate issues and it&#39;s still a problem.  I complained about scar tissues at the vaginal canal opening that they said would go away. It didn&#39;t. I complained about pain during dilation that they said would go away. It hasn&#39;t. Because Dr Martinez and his team suck at listening and don&#39;t believe you or just don&#39;t care when you tell them things.
</p>
<p>
Aestheticly, my labia looks like a joke. It looks OK with my legs closed (other than lacking a clitoral hood) but when my legs are open, it looks nothing like Cis anatomy. My vaginal canal opening isn&#39;t even totally inside my labia. And my urethra was left right under my clitoris. On top of all that, there are highly visible scars running along both sides.
</p>
<p>
There is so much erectile tissue left (they didn&#39;t believe me about that either. They said it was bad swelling). It causes my physical and emotional pain. Arousal is highly dysphoric.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also hair inside my vaginal canal. Dr Martinez personally told me that hair wouldn&#39;t be a problem, so I stopped taking care of it. That was a mistake.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to see Dr Pariser at the U of M in April. I hope he can help me. Because dealing Dr Martinez and his team has left me feeling tossed aside and hopeless.
</p>
<p>
If my scalding review wasn&#39;t Obvious, don&#39;t go to Mayo clinic for bottom surgery. I have had good experiences with their facial fem team (Dr Sharaf and Dr Bite). But don&#39;t go with Dr Martinez. Please.

Hey - I had my first vaginoplasty with Martinez. All of these issues are revisable. The anatomical choices are to maximize healing and available tissue for the second stage where they reposition your urethra, remove excess tissue, and etcetera. Mine was with Dr Warner at Mayo. You&#39;ve had the first of two stages. A year after the first stage you go in for a consultation and mention the urethra, labia, etc issues and they refer you to Warner&#39;s team. They&#39;re very experienced and did a great job with mine. They just want to give you plenty of time to heal up in between.
</p>
<p>
Bite and Sharaf are doing my FFS next month. What did you have done?

Listen, it sounds like you had a good experience with him, and I don&#39;t mean to invalidate that, but most of the things that I have a problem with are not revisable.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: The fact that this should have been two surgeries, has has turned into five is ridiculous. And it&#39;s because they didn&#39;t listen to me when I had complaints, didn&#39;t communicate important information to me, and didn&#39;t do a good job taking care of my problems during followups are not something that can be revised.  At this point, both me and my girlfriend have had a consult with Dr Paiser. And just from the initial consult that my girlfriend got, The team at the U of M is MUCH better at communicating their plan, their expectations after surgery, major problems that other patients have had, timeliness for surgery. I was very impressed compared to the teams at Mayo.
</p>
<p>
OK, full post.
</p>
<p>
One of the things I failed to mention, because I get emotional talking about this, is that my vaginal canal is less than a quarter of an inch away from my anus. During the healing process, I had to be extremely careful whenever I pooped to be very clean, because there was healing tissue right next to my anus. Less than a quarter of an inch away. Even now that everything is healed, I always have to wipe in my canal to make sure that there isnt&#39; poop in the canal. They can&#39;t move your vaginal canal without a major revision surgery and basically making you a brand new canal.
</p>
<p>
There is also hair in my canal. Which is not something that can be easily revised either. It&#39;s not a large amount of hair. But during penetration the hairs have gotten pulled out, which is painful. There&#39;s also a chance they get ingrown, which hasn&#39;t happened yet, but Idk how I&#39;d deal with it if it ever happens....
</p>
<p>
Communication with Dr Martinez and his team was a huge problem me. Although they did tell me that aestheticly I would probably need a revision surgery, they didn&#39;t mention that they didn&#39;t move the urethra. It&#39;s fine if it&#39;s needs a revision, but the fact they knew I would need one and didn&#39;t mention it is what I have a problem with.  They also didn&#39;t ever believe me when I would bring up problems. Like I mentioned above, the pain during dilation and the erectile tissue. If I hadn&#39;t said the words &#34;granulation tissue&#34; they wouldn&#39;t have done shit. I know because I went up a couple of times for planned followup appointments complaining about the pain, and they said &#34;things looked fine&#34; until I brought it up. Then they mentioned and said &#34;oh yes, you have a lot&#34;. That is ridiculous. It took over twenty treatments and two minor surgeries to finally deal with the problem. And those surgeries happened later than Dr Martinez and I had planned. I had to bring up the surgery again for them to even remember.

Also, I have had a revision surgery with Marintiz and Warner together. Part of the point of this revision was to remove the damage that the to slowly treated granulation tissue had done. I was told during pre op by Martinez that he could fix both the granulation tissue issues and do the aesthetic revision. Well then, during the pre op visit two weeks before the appointment he changed his mind and said he couldn&#39;t do it. Which is fine, but then neither he nor his team mentioned that surgery would have to be scheduled a year and a half later! All they told me is somebody would call me and get the appointment scheduled. This would have been fine if they had just told me that....

The revision went well for the most part. Mostly thanks to Dr Warner&#39;s team. They were much better about communicating, and have been better about followup issues than Dr Martinez and his team. However, I still had issues with granulation tissue, but on my issistance (again, not their idea, I had to bring it up and ask for it), we increased treatment amounts. They however once again failed to remove a large portion of erectile tissue. It&#39;s still a problem, which requires another surgery.

Luckily for me, Dr Paiser seems to be able to fix most of my problems. So hopefully it goes well.

I&#39;ve had two operations and a countless silver nitrate treatments to deal with hypergranulation too. Hopefully it&#39;ll be resolved soon. It seems some of us are especially prone. I have a few internal hairs too. I&#39;m going to ask about getting rid of them once the hypergranulation is resolved. I&#39;ve heard of other people having success with electrolysis and I assume that would be an option for people like you and I. They should require hair removal prior to surgery, and inform patients that their procedure has two stages. Knowing the anatomy is not final would save patients a lot of distress.

I&#39;m not sure if this is considered normal, but I have about 1.5 cm (half inch) anogenital (AGD) distance. Depends on the position I&#39;m in. Sometimes a little over two cm, sometimes about one. I haven&#39;t had issues with defecation but I can&#39;t recommend baby wipes and wiping front to back enough. There isn&#39;t a lot of data about this, but from what I have gathered the average AGD for people assigned female is 3-4 centimeters. I don&#39;t think a smaller AGD is problematic unless you&#39;re giving birth, because childbirth can cause a tear.

I&#39;m sorry you had to deal with so many scheduling problems. Mayo normally requires a ton of appointments and I get the feeling that they are super busy. Many of the surrounding states making our healthcare illegal has led to an influx of patients. On top of that, many people that delayed other procedures during the COVID emergency are getting them done now. My FFS was delayed for more than a year because of this.

I hope your revision goes well and you have a speedy recovery 🩷

I&#39;m going through mayo. Haven&#39;t had the surgery yet but the care team has been super helpful and really nice. The only hiccup I&#39;ve had is that they took me off the waiting list after I had a mental health episode and ended up in the psych hospital back in September. They said i needed six months of &#34;mental stability to be put back on&#34; IDK if that&#39;s a standard thing or not so it might have happened at fairview as well had I gone there.
