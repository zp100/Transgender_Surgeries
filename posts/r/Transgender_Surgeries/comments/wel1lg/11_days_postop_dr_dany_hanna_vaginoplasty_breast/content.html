<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/t21rd2/vaginoplasty_consultation_with_dr_dany_hanna/">My last post about my consultation with Dr Hanna
</a>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Dany Hanna performed a breast augmentation with implant (gummy bear, round, 460cc, below-breast incisions) and a penile inversion vaginoplasty with scrotal skin graft.  The total time in surgery was about 5 hours.
</p>
<p>
tl;dr I&#39;ve had complications with excessive swelling and bleeding in my bottom surgery area, but as my recovery progresses I am becoming more confident that I will maintain an excellent aesthetic and functional outcome.  I am incredibly pleased with my top surgery results, and wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Hanna as a skilled, knowledgeable, and empathetic surgeon who has thus far set me up for an ideal outcome, truly cares, and has gone above and beyond for me (dude has called me like 10 times since I was discharged, he&#39;s good y&#39;all I swear).
</p>
<p>
Why 11 days?  Since that&#39;s how long it took me to get parked in front of my laptop since surgery, and I think it&#39;s given me time to reflect on my complications and look back at my surgery somewhat objectively.

The actual day of surgery had a funny moment.  The anesthesiologist gave me fentanyl and something he said &#34;would keep me from forming memories&#34; in the prep room, I&#39;m still totally lucid in the OR and he calls me &#34;he&#34; and &#34;him&#34; a couple of times (really weird, the first time I&#39;d been misgendered by a stranger in probably a year) and I ask him to please call me &#34;she.&#34;  I then see Dr. Hanna standing over me with the most exasperated expression I can imagine on a human being&#39;s face, then I got the mask and went under.  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m in a place where I can look back on it as hilarious, that image of Dr. Hanna is permanently burned into my memory
</p>
<p>
I had a lot of issues with pain and my catheter in the first few days post op.  I eventually had to call Dr. Hanna while crying hysterically from it to beg him to prescribe something stronger than the morphine and Tylenol they were giving me, which he resolved really quickly from what I remember was kinda late at night.  Even after that my catheter bothered me the whole time in the hospital and I had to get IV dilaudid basically whenever I wanted to fall asleep, or else my pain level would sit at a steady 5/10 (rising to an 8-9 depending on how long ago I took dilaudid or percocet).  I&#39;ve since weaned off the painkillers with no issues.  As a lifelong athlete in a fairly risk-prone sport, I&#39;ve hurt myself in some pretty gnarly ways, and the pain post-op still blew me away (but, like, in a bad way).  I have not had any kind of severe or honestly even noticeable pain from my top surgery incisions and area.  Basically all of my pain subsided with the removal of the catheter, I haven&#39;t experienced more than a 4/10 since.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Hanna always visited multiple times daily.  I have never felt distant, disconnected, or like I shouldn&#39;t bother him with questions.  I really feel like I can have complete confidence in him and that I can trust his judgement and recommendations implicitly, and my condition has always improved by following his advice post op.  I got this vibe really strong from him from my consultations and pre-op appointments and it has stayed true throughout, he really puts me at ease and has made me feel well cared for.  As someone with really debilitating anxiety Dr. Hanna&#39;s disposition and character really helped me through everything.  When he brought my post op instructions to take home he put it in a little goody bag with candy and sweets!  I&#39;m glad I chose him :)
</p>
<p>
I started experiencing really bad swelling and bruising basically as soon as the compression dressing came off.  I&#39;ll have to ask Dr. Hanna again what area specifically the worst bleeding has occurred in, but he told me multiple times it was more severe than average.  It&#39;s been really frustrating for me, I went into this surgery the healthiest I&#39;ve been in my adult life (months of walking, eating plant-based and gluten free w/lots of high antioxidant fruits and healthy fats, no alcohol, super strict sleep schedule, tons of stretching and yoga...ugh) -- Dr. Hanna originally told me the bleeding could be as a result of being
<em>
too healthy
</em>
and that I had too much healthy blood flow to the area, since then he&#39;s recommended I see a hematologist to see if I have a subclinical bleeding disorder.  The bloating and swelling have really been messing with my body image, despite the overwhelming euphoria from finally getting the surgery done.  It&#39;s hard not to feel disfigured or ask myself if this would have happened if I had gone to another surgeon, but as time passes and I heal more I see that the swelling is subsiding and it makes me feel better and returns my confidence in the outcome we expected.
</p>
<p>
The worst swelling is in my lower abdomen in a straight line directly above my vagina.  I have virtually no sensation in the area (vs. little to full sensation in other parts of the surgical area).  The swelling in my thighs, butt (god I hate the butt flaps), around my incisions, and in my perineum are all going down quickly not even two weeks post op.
</p>
<p>
After some issues peeing for the first time (issues getting started, plus a sudden spike to the worst swelling I&#39;ve experienced post op), I can say with confidence my urethra is positioned anatomically correctly and functions great, even with the scab still partially covering it.  I have no issues with peeing anymore and get a nice, clean stream.  I&#39;m glad I went to a urologist :)
</p>
<p>
Depth and dilating -- I love Dr. Hanna to death, he said in my preop the day before &#34;you&#39;ll be able to stick whatever you want up there&#34; (how did he know I&#39;m lowkey freaky asdfghjk).  As far as I know I have above average depth and girth immediately post op.  As soon as the packing came out he was able to insert the purple dilator just past the fifth dot, and then the blue dilator up to the fifth dot (I made a lot of faces with the blue one).  My initial dilating regimen is 4x daily for 20 minutes, 10 mins with the purple and 10 mins with the blue to the same depths as the first time.  My only issue I&#39;ve had dilating is having kind of difficult insertion at times, I think this is because of my &#34;rock hard pelvic floor&#34; as Dr. Hanna described me.  The blue dilator especially really feels like I have to push it in against a lot of pressure, but it keeps going to the full depth and I never feel any pain and there&#39;s been no bleeding so I&#39;m kinda just rolling with it??  It&#39;s still getting easier and better over time, he says I&#39;ll probably start introducing the green dilator around 3 weeks post op with some estrogen cream.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s not much to say about my top surgery results and recovery besides that I am so thrilled with it and happy I elected to get both at the same time.  Getting up and out of bed was really difficult because of it initially, but by now I have most of the range of motion with my arms and can even get up from laying down flat with no issues.  Just like my bottom surgery, I&#39;m experiencing above average bruising and swelling in my breasts post op, but I&#39;ve been looking at them (a lot lmao, I love them) when I undress to shower and everything is going down and healing really quickly.  I gave Dr. Hanna some aesthetic freedom to pick the size of my implants during surgery to help make my chest look the most natural and he ended up using 460cc gummy bear implants.  I don&#39;t have any abnormal hardness, pain, stretching, or tenderness so far.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll post another update at 1 month. I&#39;m taking pictures almost every day and going back and looking through  them really helps my perspective on how much and how well I&#39;m healing.  And I&#39;m also happy to answer any questions anyone has about my experience if I forgot to include stuff in the text here.  Good luck to everyone else pushing for SRS -- even with my complications it&#39;s still the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit:
</strong>
I added my day 12 top surgery pics and I can&#39;t believe I forgot such a huge detail to include.  My initial hospital stay was supposed to be 3 nights, but they kept me an extra 3 nights.  On my discharge date my hemoglobin was 3.3, compared to the reference range of around 12-15 for women.  They gave me an iron infusion the first night with no change the following day, a blood transfusion the second night that bumped me up to 7.8, then a blood transfusion the third night that bumped me up to 8.6 at which point they determined they wouldn&#39;t do anything different if they discharged me or not.  I never at any point felt dizzy or weak when standing.  Dr. Hanna informed me I lost very little blood during the surgery itself, about 100cc&#39;s.  When he removed the compression bandage, I apparently bled a lot around my urethra (hence all the blood in my Day 2 picture).  He had to use a clotting aid to get the bleeding to stop.  I was on some good shit pain meds, idk how much blood I lost but I&#39;m not sure if it was enough to drop my hemoglobin that much.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at day 18 post-op and the swelling in my lower abdomen above my vagina has not lowered noticeably.  I&#39;ll have to include a side-on picture in my next post, it&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a cantaloupe embedded in my abdomen.  Given that I have no history of major or lasting swelling after numerous injuries I&#39;m genuinely very confused and upset about it.  While my vaginal canal is fine and pointing the right direction, now that the scab has fallen off, the other parts of my vagina are mildly everted due to the swelling and aren&#39;t hidden at all by my labia.  As long as things return to how they looked in my Day 2 picture as the swelling eventually goes down I&#39;ll be happy, I just have a hard time wrapping my mind around the idea that the swelling has somehow originated from me as a reaction to the surgery and not to an external stimuli during or after surgery that specifically caused it.
</p>
<p>
I also wanted to add that the staff at Carrollton Regional Medical Center were generally amazing and excellent to me, outside of the nighttime nurses being slow with pain meds a couple of times, and they brought me normal bread instead of gluten free bread once (I could tell before taking a bite but heck it reminded me how much better normal bread looks/feels).  One of the nurses even told my bf and I that we looked alike, which meant god had made us to be together, which was cute :)  Apparently I had a bit of a meltdown one of the nights over being misgendered but I was told I had it after the fact and have no memory of it (painkillers :D), so take that with however many grains of salt you deem appropriate; I remember no issues with pronouns besides the anesthesiologist.  My name could not be messed up because I legally changed it long before this surgery.

That’s very understandable, it takes a lot to make it through the whole process. I prepared for 10+ years and it still broke me at times. You don’t want to rush it or take a risk you aren’t comfortable with.

For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve found it super helpful to focus on all the things I can control in my personal journey towards srs. I&#39;m an incredibly anxiety-ridden person. I was terrified of general anesthesia going in. My therapist was really helpful with helping me come to terms with the risks and my anxiety and really take hold of my own life
</p>
<p>
You can&#39;t take the risk out of life and what may be the best thing for you, but there will always be parts in your control that you can use to improve your life and outcome. That, my loving and supportive boyfriend, and Dr Hanna&#39;s demeanor and assurances really got me through surgery to the other side :)

Oh my God... I&#39;m not a doctor but have urological issues and must self cath 6 or 7 times a day and have had Foleys in enough times to say I&#39;m not in the least bit surprised that is why you mentioned the catheter and pain together.  For one thing they haven&#39;t anchored it???  That is batshit level crazy because it will be certain to cause you significant pain at the point it goes into you because its allowed to freely go anywhere and unless you remain perfectly still all the time it will move versus your urethera&#39;s direction and where its at an angle?  Ouch....  At least for sure in the last pix I looked at you can see where it &#34;Y&#34;s off and its not taped or attached to one of those new fangled attachment gizmos.  Its that moving around where it enters your urethera that hurt I bet.  Right?  In one of the photos there is a disturbing amount of gunk going down an inch or two from where it goes in your urethera.  I&#39;m pretty sure its documented that a foley should be cleaned daily!  Last I&#39;m just guessing and maybe it me with a small urethera but that one you had looks huge!  As in a very wide diameter foley.  Oh one extra comment. This Foley appears to be vinyl (Ouch ouch ouch - TOO STIFF!!) or red rubber (Horrors) like the old old school BARDs that people were supposed to reuse.  Uncomfortable to say the least unless they really go to town with lubricant and in none of the pictures does it look like there was any.  I&#39;m not sure its kosher to put lube onto the Cath after insertion but I certainly did that when I had to wear a foley.  it looks like it might have helped.  In either event they don&#39;t need to use Vinyl because they make silicone or silicone over vinyl Foleys and these are the norm not the exception.  And if there was significant pain I&#39;m wondering why someone didn&#39;t try to refit yours with something smaller (Tape it down for God&#39;s sake) and not use stiff Vinyl.  I&#39;m not suggesting that having a foley in a urethera thats just been cut and sewn should be pain free but there ARE things they could have done to make it so it didn&#39;t turn into a 9/10 &#34;Give me all the narcotics you&#39;ve got&#34; level.  I say this last part not to be mean but I really honestly think everyone who puts catheters into patients should know what it feels like first hand. I asked a relative who is in nursing if they ever do that and she acted like I was nuts. Then I asked if they practiced putting in IVs by IVing each other in nursing school thinking &#34;They must... Right?&#34; Nope...  And seriously,  How do they learn?  And why not? its not like putting a cath or IV into yourself is dangerous.  Ok  I&#39;m kind of ranting but I swear I&#39;m going to write a Foley / Cath guide if for no other reason to get it off my chest. Q: When you were in pain did you specifically mention it being where the catheter was (or went in) and if so what did they do?  Did they try a different sized or type of one?  Did they give it a gentle tug to see if the ballon had broken?  It sounds like they just knocked you out with narcotics.  I could write another guide on how those drugs  Ok - enough ranting from me.  I&#39;m glad your through this and congrats on what looks like excellent results.

I did mention that the catheter was the source of pain, and no they did not anchor it until finally the day before I left the hospital. I didn&#39;t come into surgery knowing anything about catheters so I didn&#39;t know to ask. Once it was anchored to my thigh the pain got a little better but it felt like a lot of damage had already been done, the hose would just fall off my bed and pull on me all night and it was at my feet so I couldn&#39;t always reach it to bring some slack back onto my hospital bed.  It was rough, but Dr Hanna insisted that the lack of anchoring somehow helped after. Peeing works okay for me so I guess I&#39;ll take his word for it??? Idk
</p>
<p>
From my understanding they use a pretty decent diameter cath to put pressure on the walls of the urethra to help it heal fully, so urine doesn&#39;t leak anywhere it shouldn&#39;t once healed. Because of that they never would have changed it out for any reason, it needed to stay in place to facilitate proper healing

This really stinks...  I really am going to write a foley . catheter guide,  I don&#39;t know how to get anyone in the medical world to read it but omg did they do a horrible job.  Just having had surgery and its hanging loose at all (That is plenty bad enough) but pulling on all night!!!  For the love of God that had to hurt I mean...  because the connection is hanging over the bed so the weight is pulling open your urethera over the side of the bed?   I am so sorry to hear about your experience.  Oh - wanted to say yes I understand they want to size it so urine is not leaking out around the edges but that one?  I think they opted for extra huge to avoid urine spills but OMG if they ever put one of those in themselves I bet you they would dial down that desire to cram a garden hose sized cath in you.
</p>
<p>
I think... I would suggest to anyone reading this in the future (For real) to request they put the foley in before they knock you out so you can say something like &#34;Could we go with something smaller?&#34; And if they don&#39;t anchor it so its not pulling down or sideways?  Ask for the medical tape and do it yourself if you have to.  That must have been total agony.
</p>
<p>
If a cath is the right size it feels a little odd (The first times you cath - go slow and if it feels stuck coughing usually works) but the important point is its not supposed to hurt.  In the Videos of GRS that I&#39;ve seen they always seem to wait until the patient is out and while I don&#39;t remember this specifically I don&#39;t recall them using a lot of lube. Trust me when you do them to yourself you don&#39;t order huge ones or shove un-lubricated caths in yourself if you can help it. They make a product that numbs the urethera before they do that procedure to look into the bladder and I&#39;ve used an injectable gel to get everything super slippery.  Actually after having a hospital installed Foley for a couple weeks.  I think that is when I learned about daily washing the part of the cath where it goes in (Simple soap and water) and for sure anchoring it in two places.  One near the entrance to it doesn&#39;t pull on you sideways and a second time down your thigh so its not pulling on you.  And if one pulls loose you have the other.  I actually don&#39;t thing the gizmos are that great.  Most allow some sideways motion and the goal should be for it not to move.  If you have a Vagina that simplifies things.  If you have a penis I think you need to have that firmly taped against the body.
</p>
<p>
Well anyway welcome home. Glad your surgery came out good just... not the best care at least as far as that foley.  Argh!
