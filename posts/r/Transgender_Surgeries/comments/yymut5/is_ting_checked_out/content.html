I&#39;ve read a bunch of mixed reviews of Ting - mostly that his bedside manner is terrible, but his results seem good these days.
<a href="https://youtu.be/0QKv6fEtTtk?t=2136">In this interview from 2020, he talks about he&#39;s looking to exit the industry in five years.</a>
I worry that he&#39;s on his way out and doesn&#39;t care so much about patient experience / quality of work. I&#39;ve seen his work in-person, and heard good things about the experience from 2019, but not sure how it is these days?
</p>
<p>
Does anyone else have a perspective on this?

Ting is still very much operating. He has a current fellow, and his last fellow (Elan Horesh), whose results are next-level, just completed training and was hired on with the Ting/Avanessian Sinai CTMS group
</p>
<p>
I do not get the impression that he would sacrifice quality, especially not while training a fellow

Yeah.. that’s my read. Which led to the question…
</p>
<p>
I get the sense he’s just kind of doing it as a job, which I totally get. But if he’s at the end of his career and looking to retire, I could see him being checked out from the work and doing it on autopilot.

Well, I’ve seen his work, and it’s great.. and heard amazing things about it. So he’s still my choice so far… but yeah it doesn’t instill confidence

Agreed just had my srs and yes his bedside manner did not inspire confidence, my only concern really was function and his answer was literally that&#39;s the goal. That being said so far I am very pleased with the results, and even as early as it is I have alot of feeling already.
