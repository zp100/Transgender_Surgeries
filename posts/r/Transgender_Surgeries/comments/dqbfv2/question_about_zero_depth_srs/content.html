My surgeon says “yes”. With all the risks/issues that come with it should you go that route. You would need the tissue for canal to come from elsewhere, so that would mean colon, a graft, etc. I don’t know about aesthetics when doing it later.
</p>

I do not know if zero-depth increases your visual outcome for the vulvoplasty over the full thing. I’m going back for a labiaplasty, but this was planned from the start (two-stage surgery).
</p>
<p>
I have zero regrets on getting mine, but my recovery has not been easy, so don’t expect it to necessarily be a walk in the park either.

Peritoneal pull through is a technique modeled after what they do for cis women born without a canal. I&#39;d assume it&#39;s theoretically possible, but finding a surgeon tomorrow would be hard. Maybe in a year or two, peritoneal tissue is still new to the scene. Edit: misspelled peritoneal

Thank you, would you mind saying who you’re having your second stage with?

I had this about a month ago. I&#39;m glad that I chose this given how hard the recovery has been in general. I feel like I have about 1.5 inches of depth, which is enough for me, plus I&#39;m happy with the aesthetics overall. My surgeon told me that I can add depth later if I want to, but the graft has to come from somewhere.
