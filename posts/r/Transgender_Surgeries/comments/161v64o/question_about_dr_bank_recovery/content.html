I am working from home(I am a coder with remote work), I am worrying about lengthy recovery with Dr Bank, so I want to ask you some questions. FYI I heard that recovery for Asian people is far worse, so I want you to know that I am not Asian.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Will I be able to work full time from home after 1 month post op?
</li>
<li>
If I will not dilate, will it shorten or make easier a recovery time?
</li>
<li>
I don&#39;t want very deep vaginal canal, my goal is only about 13-14 cm, I think this would be enough, since I don&#39;t want to have sex with big dildo/penises, so should I dilate at the same effort, as if I wanted deeper vaginal canal? Should I still dilate to maintain that depth?
</li>
<li>
I have very long and saggy skin on my scrotum (I don&#39;t know why but it stretches very very well, it looks like excessive skin), it has a lot of folds, would it affect aesthetics of labia majora? Can it be fixed with revision? Will my stretchy skin help with dilation?
</li>
</ol>

Hi, I had surgery with Dr. Bank three months ago.  From reading online and talking with some asian patients at the clinic I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true that they have a more difficult recovery, rather east-asian people are more likely to end up with very visible scars.
</p>

<p>
Almost certainly yes, I restarted my university classes around 3 weeks post op.

<p>
DO NOT DO THIS.  The reason the Suporn method has a more difficult recovery than PI is that the vagina is made from a skin graft, rather than a flap, with a ring of scar tissue near the entrance which contracts as it heals, making dilation more difficult.  Not dilating during the recovery would technically make the recovery easier, however it will also cause your vagina to permanently contract to be almost sealed, which might require it to be surgically removed later on to avoid infection.  If you do not want to dilate at all you can maybe talk to Dr. Bank about doing zero-depth, I have never heard of him doing this though.

<p>
13-14 cm is on the slightly lower end of Dr. Banks average depth, I have 15cm.  You should dilate to full depth and will probably lose a centimeter or two during the recovery.  Since you&#39;re okay with less depth that will probably make dilation easier.

<p>
Dr. Bank uses the technique pioneered by his predecessor, Dr. Suporn.  They use a graft of scrotum skin to create the vaginal canal and form the labiae from a flap of penis skin.  Your scrotum will not affect aesthetics and will probably not affect depth either since that&#39;s usually limited by the amount of internal space your body has rather than the amount of scrotal skin.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any more questions, I&#39;m happy to answer them.

thank you for that detailed reply, especially about dilation, didn&#39;t know that! That was very useful! I want to clarify one thing. I don&#39;t have so called &#39;micropenis&#39; but my &#39;penis&#39; is relatively small (around 9-10 cm long when erected, not circumcised), so I don&#39;t think I have that much material from it, I think he will have to use some skin from scrotum and some skin from penis to form outer and inner labia, that&#39;s why I worried about my scrotum skin. Btw some photos of post-op Dr Bank look like some amounts of skin were taken from scrotum to form outer labia (because of wrinkled surface of outer labia on some photos I suppose). Maybe that was happen because of swelling, I don&#39;t know. Could wrinkling of outer labia be fixed?

Sorry for the late reply, I don&#39;t check Reddit very often.  I had quite a lot of material before surgery and there is a little bit of scrotal skin on my labia majora, I think that&#39;s normal.  As for it being &#34;fixed&#34;, that sounds like something Dr. Bank could do in the free revision pretty easily, though I can&#39;t say for certain.

Do you have any source for East Asian girls getting more visible scars that I can look at?

Hi!!
</p>
<p>
I didn’t go to bank, I went to Chett, but I work from home full time as well. I was back online after 2 weeks! Just working from my hospital bed.
</p>
<p>
Go at your own pace though and definitely take it easy !

Thank you! I heard that Chett has similar technique and long recovery.

I’ve heard of people working from hospital so I expect a month later it should be feasible. But you’re going to spend a fair lot of time dilating.
</p>
<p>
You probably won’t be able to sit in a chair for long either, so be prepared to work from bed.
</p>
<p>
Pick if different surgeon if you don’t want to dilate.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think I’ve heard any opinion on wether dilation to a lower depth is easier or not. It will be for a very short time, but you’ll quickly lose the previous depth and it may just go back to normal difficulty.
</p>
<p>
Excess skin should be a very easy revision. But are you sure you don’t have Ehlers–Danlos syndromes? That would be bad.

I am picking it for aesthetics of external genitalia and that he doesn&#39;t require much material for it. I heard that he performs minimal depth surgery

I don&#39;t think that I have that syndrome, I think my gonads was lowered before HRT and scrotum just stretched. Any other skin from other areas is normal. I don&#39;t have back problems or very flexible joints. But why it is bad for that surgery?

You can request to have a specific depth, specially if you want a smaller size. The labia is also done with the penis skin.

I looked at some results and it looks like labia majora at least partially done from scrotum skin. I know that labia minora is done from penile skin, but I meant labia majora
