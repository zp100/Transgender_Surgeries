Has anyone had SRS with Dr Christine McGinn and if so did you have to pay out of pocket and later on your insurance provider reimburse you your money?

I did, and yes, I paid out of pocket and billed my insurance company afterward.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGin over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in Pennsylvania? How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Yes. However you have to file your claim with your insurance company yourself. And depending on the carrier, even if you are covered for GCS, be prepared for them to try to stonewall you. It can be a real PITA.
</p>
<p>
However, that  being said, I just had my 6 month follow up w/ McGinn yesterday and would definitely 10/10 recommend her. The whole staff is lovely. Good luck! âœŒ
</p>
<p>
Edit - also because McGinn doesn&#39;t accept insurance, the insurance company considers her to be out of network, so you will need to confirm what the out of network coverage rate is with them.
</p>
<p>
For me, BC/BS was all but worthless. Mcginn&#39;s fee is $17k but insurance only covers what they deem the allowable rate  to be - which is less than $3k
