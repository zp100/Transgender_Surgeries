So I just stubbed across this. Basically the surgery does everything except for the vaginal canal so you can‚Äôt have penetrative sex with you neo vagina. The reason I‚Äôm curious about this is bc I don‚Äôt want to go through the process of dilation for the rest of my life and have been researching various work arounds on the subject. I was wondering is anyone has had a Zero Depth Vaginoplasty and what it looks like?

Maybe I shouldn&#39;t reply because I&#39;d not even
<em>
consider
</em>
zero depth for myself, since it would preclude having sex‚Äîbut from what I&#39;ve seen it looks pretty much like a normal vulva.

I haven&#39;t had the op yet, but if dilation is your worry you could also look into minimal depth vaginoplasty, no need to dilate and you can get a couple inches or so of depth for at least fingers or a bullet vibe or something.

I had zero depth surgery and it looks exactly as I wanted and expected.  I do sometimes wonder if I should have had the full surgery, but then I remind myself why I chose this option, and those reasons still stand, so no regrets :)

Oh cool, thank you!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m considering Vulvoplasty, and my main concern is sexual stimulation after the surgery. I have had a significant amount of atrophy to my parts, and they stay up inside of me all the time. Would this have any impact on the outcome?
</p>
<p>
Currently, my pe*is works just a clit. Where I get wet when I&#39;m aroused, I can be fingered to an orgasm, and I can have multiple orgasms.
</p>
<p>
I am terrified of losing this functionality that I currently have.
</p>
<p>
Can you share your experience when it comes to sexual stimulation? Can you be fingered to an orgasm, and do you get wet when you&#39;re aroused? And can you orgasm through oral stimulation? And visually speaking, are you pleased?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for taking the time! üé†E

Wow, thank you so much for the information!
</p>
<p>
I should have been more specific, when I said fingered I meant clitoral stimulation.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you&#39;re doing well and I wish you continued progress. üé†E

Just make sure that it is your decision and not the surgeon&#39;s who just not confident enough to perform penile inversion, trying to push patients to ZDV scaring them with associated risks of dilation =)

I&#39;ve had one- looks &#34;normal&#34; or well within the range of normal.  Partner says it looks amazing so I&#39;m happy:)
</p>
<p>
I had mine with Christine McGinn.  Recovery was fine, usual hospital stay and recovery- took about two weeks before I was &#34;back to normal&#34; and about two months before I was doing some basic exercise again. It&#39;s been coming up on two years recovery and all is great- no scars or complications.
</p>
<p>
I liked it especially as no electrolysis leading up to it, much shorter and less complicated recovery and I&#39;m a lesbian so I didn&#39;t care about the penetration bit which just grosses me out thinking about.
</p>
<p>
If you are in a similar situation with similar desired outcomes, I really recommend it. Glad to PM with my personal experience or any questions. I also did a thread here at the time.

It is very difficult to answer when I also wanted zero depth, but at the last moment I changed my mind.
</p>
<p>
Who knows what could happen in the future.

Think carefully before making your decision.  I say this because depending on your age you do restrict options that you may regret.  Sadly I think my sexuality has flipped, which is common within the trans community........ I‚Äôm now straight rather than lesbian I thought I wasüôà. Xx
