This surgeon sounds highly suspicious.  ALL (good) surgeons who perform PI require you to dilate.  It will remain that way until further advances are made.

Dilators not provided? Dilation not required? What surgeon is this? Probably someone new that doesn’t know what they’re doing?

Would you mind naming the surgeon? I&#39;d like to add this post to the wiki.

<p>
Personally I think this sounds very bad and I&#39;d be looking overseas if you can afford it.

This is not much info, but
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/c5wghs/anyone_had_srs_in_finland/es8njzr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app">here’s a link to an earlier comment of mine on the topic
</a>
, I don’t know if you’ve seen it yet. Basically you can’t expect to get passing vulva. The skill level between the five public surgeons varies too, and I’ve only seen a result from one of them. But then again you can’t choose which of the five you get, so it’s best to expect to be operated by the least skilled if you are going to get the surgery done here in Finland.
</p>
<p>
E: The surgeons have made some stupid claims. When I had a consultation with them, they said that ”there is no hair at the penile shaft” when I mentioned that I had hair there. When I continued the topic, she said that ”the hair in the genital area is not usually an issue”, despite the fact that it’s going to be inside the canal if it’s not removed. They also told me that no dilation is needed and that they won’t provide a set for dilation (”dildos” is the word they used). They also gave me a form to fill that said ”a form for men”, which was full of transphobic bullshit. I told them that they gave me incorrect form to fill, that the form was for men, not me, but they replied that it’s the correct form.

I wouldn&#39;t trust them on the hair removal. Have a look here

I agree its a risk anywhere, but some dice are better/worse than others. The problem is working out which one&#39;s which.

True, after 2-3 years dilation becomes unnecessary except maybe once in a blue moon (every quarter year) for depth management.  The reason that it is require for the first 1-2 is so that the muscles around the vagina don’t stiffen and close up the vagina as they are healing.  After that it doesn’t matter too much.  The skin doesn’t shrink or heal together after it is healed 3 months post-op.  Complete myth.

If you&#39;re gonna say something that goes against the medical advice of almost every practicing GRS surgeon you really should bring a source. Kinda irresponsible otherwise.

It’s info that I’ve received from at least four of the newer surgeons trained by Dr. Bowers as well as several of their patients.  The idea that a neovagina is a permanent open wound is rather primitive and transphobic.  Skin doesn’t magically weld together when pressed together.  There has to be an open wound for it to do that.  Once the major muscle groups in the area heal and relax, dilation becomes almost unnecessary except to maintain depth maybe once quarterly.  The reason we dilate, is because when muscles become severely injured they tense and if left like that they can become fibrous and stiff.  It’s why we stretch and do physical therapy after leg injuries or back injuries.  Leaving the injury unmanaged is a spell for getting a bad back or leg.  Same goes for the pelvic floor muscles.

Where did you get the information from? Have you been post-op for longer than 3 years? How many people do you know, who have been post-op for longer than 3 years, have stopped regular dilation and have been completely fine?

6 people.  It’s basic medical logic.  Skin doesn’t grow together unless it is an open wound so skin on the inside of a neovagina won’t do that either.  It’ll get slimy over time, but it’s not like it fuses together.  The surgeon I’m scheduled with next year as well as her colleagues that she works with explained it to me that the main concern is muscle fibration and that we want the pelvic floor muscles to remain flexible so we have to stretch them until the area is healed much as one would do physical therapy for any major muscle group wound.  There is a small chance for atrophy over time and depth loss, but it depends on how it heals and when it is officially done healing.  It can take up to three years.  To insinuate that a neovagina is like an open wound that will fuse together and close without rigorous care is not only irrational and objectively false, but somewhat transphobic as well.
</p>
<p>
Now don’t get me wrong.  I’m NOT saying that a neovagina doesn’t need care.  I’m saying that people tend to blow the amount it needs out of the water.

I wonder how many SRS procedures this surgeon has actually done and it&#39;d interesting to know what the aftercare will be like especially showing you how to dilate safely.

I think some time ago, someone use to mention that Dr Oliver Fenton in the UK somehow rearranged her muscles, and she only started dilation after a couple of weeks of her SRS. But from what you describe, it doesn&#39;t sound any similar. But you can always dilate yourself. Anyway, from what you describe, it doesn&#39;t sound like that those surgeons are up to the par.
