Not a whole lot going on today, I did manage to sleep for 5 uninterrupted hours last night which was glorious (plus a few 1 hour chunks). I&#39;m no longer waking up due to abdominal cramping, it&#39;s very definitely something painful to do with my clit. Yay, it has sensation. Boo, something hurts at night. I&#39;m going to try not going to sleep with ice packs on to see if I&#39;ve been overheating the area.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, a pretty low energy day, watched Youtube videos, hung out, chatted, dilated, I think the high point of my day was showering, feeling the water flowing over me feels so right without a penis in the way.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is simultaneously uncomfortable and boring, trying to keep my pelvic muscles fully relaxed at the same time as I&#39;m pressing a hard plastic dilator against the apex of my vagina (which is kind of sore, and I feel it on the inside of my lower back) is not fun. And then lie there for ~25 minutes after it&#39;s in. (My schedule calls for 15 minutes at depth. It takes me about 5 minute to get almost to depth, then over the next 5-10 minutes I relax a bit more and get a bit deeper, then I stay there for 15 minutes. It&#39;s self maintenance, and kind of pulls at the separation, s oit&#39;s kind of ouchie at the same time.

Anyways, bed time.
