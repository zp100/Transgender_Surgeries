I realize that this isn&#39;t a pretty result at the moment, I wanted to post it anyways since it&#39;s a more realistic representation of week 3.5 instead of a Best Case photo. It&#39;s definitely healing though, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how it finally looks after a few months. Anatomically, everything is in the right place, even if some of the stitches and skin still looks pretty rough.

tbh i was very surprised how good it looked after i first read in the title that it wasnt even a month.. i&#39;m quite sensitive considering operations (any really) and all that stuff, its normally difficult for me to look at but i think this looks really good for such a short time! Bet itll look awesome in the end!

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Wittenberg over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. Wittenberg? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in San Francisco? How was Dr. Wittenberg aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

<p>
how was your recovery so far?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&#39;s been hard but not disastrous - everything is going to plan but GRS recovery is just rough.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wanted peritoneal pull-through so there weren&#39;t many options. I also went to her in the past for an orchi and I really liked her work and how she treats her patients. She&#39;s a
<em>
really
</em>
talented surgeon and does great work.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I can&#39;t really speak to that because it hasn&#39;t finished healing yet, but if it keeps on-track the way it is now, I think it&#39;ll be great. Vaginal depth started off at 15cm but I think I&#39;ve gone down to 13cm or so - it&#39;s hard to say because the way I measure is via where the labia lines up with the dot, and since the swelling is going down, it&#39;s going to
<em>
appear
</em>
like I&#39;m losing depth.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How was the stay in San Francisco?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I live here so not quite the same as people visiting. SF is a great city but staying here is probably
<em>
really
</em>
expensive. Everything is orderable online though (Prime Now / Caviar etc) which means that when you&#39;re really feeling like garbage, you won&#39;t have to go out shopping or anything.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How was Dr. Wittenberg aftercare?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Aftercare is imho the only weak part of Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s office - her normal follow-up is fine, but her on-call &#34;Shit is Bad and it&#39;s 9pm&#34; phone service absolutely sucks. You call them, you get a generic person who just takes down your info, then says &#34;We&#39;ll call you back&#34;. Then, a nurse calls you back, takes down your same info,
<em>
also
</em>
knows nothing about GRS, then says, &#34;We&#39;ll call you back&#34;.
<em>
Then finally
</em>
, Dr. Wittenberg or some other person who can actually help, will
<em>
finally
</em>
call you back, hours after you initiated the first call.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, at the end of the day, Dr. Wittenberg
<em>
will
</em>
help you out, but in the short term when you&#39;re scared or in pain and need help, you&#39;re kind of up a creek for a bit. She could really improve this system.

I mean your body went through a pretty major change, it’ll take time to heal and stop swelling!

Can’t figure it out either.  Elsewhere in this thread I got ups though so I’m looking at it like a wash.
</p>
<p>
It may also be people looking through my post history and downvoting everything I have posted.  I riled up some angry white guys yesterday.

My dilation schedule is 10 minutes, 3 times a day - way shorter than what I&#39;ve seen from some other surgeons. After 3 months it goes down to....2x/day? Not sure. Using the purple Soulsource dilator atm, I can get the blue one in but it&#39;s difficult
