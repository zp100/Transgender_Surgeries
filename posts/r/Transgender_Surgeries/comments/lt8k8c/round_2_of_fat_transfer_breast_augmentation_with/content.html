I had a second round of fat transfer with
<a href="http://www.zeidlerplasticsurgery.com/">Dr Zeidler
</a>
yesterday. In addition I had lipo contouring of my hip dips as well as facial fat transfer to my temples, cheeks, and lips.
</p>
<p>
First taking a look at my first round (in conjunction with an abdominoplasty - which I have also made posts on )
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Now my current breasts are still very swollen as they were stabbed repeatedly, as these were taken the day after surgery. They will subsequently get smaller as the swelling goes down and some amount of fat will likely be lost. A good amount of retainment is around 70-80%.
</p>
<p>
I had 840cc of fat in total harvested from me and had 40cc into my face, 250cc into each breast, 150 into each hip. I had previously had 200(l)/250(r)cc of fat placed into my breasts.  I had also had facial fat grafting done in my FFS.

</a>
</p>
<p>
anyway I thought people may find it interesting to see this point of the process in fat transfer. I currently have very little pain, haven&#39;t taken any opioids today on day 2, walking regularly and trying to eat lots of protein rich food to feed the boobs.
</p>
<p>
happy to answer any questions of course

Thanks for all that!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for a BA/Abdominoplasty/Lipo later this year.
</p>
<p>
I have questions.. :)
</p>
<p>
How do you feel about the abdomino scar? I&#39;ve seen some that are just kind of horrifying, like I would never want it to be seen.
</p>
<p>
How satisfied are you with the hip dip transfer? I&#39;m thinking about asking my surgeon to do this as an add on and also using any extra fat to &#39;fill out&#39; the implants if needed.

I am really happy with my abdominoplasty scar. You can see a lot more of it here -
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ldjcg5/3_months_post_op_fat_grafting_breast_augmentation/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ldjcg5/3_months_post_op_fat_grafting_breast_augmentation/
</a>
I don&#39;t have any dog earring and basically no keloiding. I&#39;m also really happy with my belly button  - i think it looks cute and great.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
regarding hip dips, it&#39;s only been a day so I can&#39;t really say how the final result will be but so far I really like it.

Thanks for posting all of this! Pls feel free to ignore any questions if they are too personal.
</p>
<p>
Did you have fat transferred to your breasts and hips at the same time?
</p>
<p>
How is it sleeping? I&#39;m assuming it has to be on your back. My ex did fat grafts and she was in a ton of pain trying to sleep with the harvest sites on her back.
</p>
<p>
What was your BMI to do this? You looked fairly skinny in your before pics

oh yeah happy to answer

<p>
my initial fat transfer was just to the breasts when i had my abdominoplasty. This time I had it to both the hips and breasts.
</p>

<p>
Sleeping is annoying. It&#39;s on my back and elevated as it is with many surgeries. This is the third aesthetic surgery in a year though so I&#39;m somewhat used to the process and have streamlined it pretty well. It&#39;s complicated by I also try to not move my head in my sleep because I also got facial fat grafting. Surprisingly I haven&#39;t had a lot of pain from this surgery relative to other ones. I haven&#39;t actually taken any oxy today on my second day for instance, just gabapentin.

Hey! Fist off you look awesome, I&#39;m very jealous!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, can I ask how happy you are with the breast procedure overall? Would you recommend it over a traditional BA if you made the choice again, knowing what you know now?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m thinking about getting a breast fat transfer procedure myself as I mainly just want to even out my boobs and gain a little shape and volume

Aww thank you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m Soo pleased with the procedure. Before my second round I was still really thrilled with my boobs and right now I&#39;m still in the early phase of healing from my second round but I&#39;m totally stoked on it so far. I would definitely still do this over implants if I had to do it over.
</p>
<p>
Yeah if your goals are to improve shape and increase size by some but not a very specific amount and you have enough fat to transfer then I think that makes you a good potential candidate.
