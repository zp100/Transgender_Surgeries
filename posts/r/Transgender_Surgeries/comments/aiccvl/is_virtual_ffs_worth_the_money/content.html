So I’m going to contact Facial Team soon to try and get a quote for type 4 forehead reconstruction.  But I’m also looking for an experts advice on anything else that stands out.  The only thing that really does to me is my jawline, but only from certain angles.
<br>
So is it worth it to pay Virtual FFS to give me some advice/renderings? Or should I just send pictures to the surgeon?

I paid for the written consult and I think that it was worth it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d really be worth it to pay for photos, which aren&#39;t likely to be an accurate representation of your post-FFS face anyway.

Thanks, I hadn’t looked into it that closely, didn’t know you could just get the written consult.

So.  I did virtual.  The thing with virtual is that she will only remove as little as possible.  As in if there was a scale of 1 to a 100.  It will only get you to 25.  Where there is still far more that can be done
