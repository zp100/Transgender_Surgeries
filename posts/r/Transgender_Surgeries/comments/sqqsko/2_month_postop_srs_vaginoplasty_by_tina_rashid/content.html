Update: Since my last post I went to the doctors &amp; found out I got an infection (yay lucky me) I was in so much pain I was stuck in bed for days I couldn’t even use purple anymore and spent weeks with the small P2 dilator only recently (last week) I used purple again and now today I started blue for the first time no problems with that
</p>
<p>
Bleeding stopped around week 5 and came back when I got the infection I was bleeding ALOT and i’m suprised I managed to keep dilating because I was so close to giving up
</p>
<p>
(I’ve been taking antibiotics and its still not fully gone I need better ones)
</p>
<p>
I moved down to dilating 2 times a day (40 minutes in the morning 40 at night) a few days ago I didnt get cleared by my surgeon to do it but I really dont care anymore post-op depression has been killing me for weeks I can’t do 3 anymore I need to do something other than dilating all day and now I feel so much better
</p>
<p>
My mental health has been so horrible &amp; the only person i’ve had to support me/make me feel better is my gf &amp; because i’m in recovery were long distance so yeah :( it’s been really hard I feel so sorry for anyone going through the same I wouldn’t wish this suffering on anyone
</p>
<p>
For some reason the stitch site on the top left side of my labia does not want to heal it keeps going back to the way it was everytime it heals and it’s getting frustrating cause there’s nothing I want more than to put hair removal cream on my vagina (hair is annoying lmao) the swelling has gone down alot though i’m happy about that atleast
</p>
<p>
I haven’t seen my surgeon yet cause I can’t travel &amp; just how expensive it is hopefully I can next month but thats all for now

ofc! 🤍🤍 thats the main reason why I post about it when I was pre-op I barely found anything posting here has its downsides from creeps messaging but it’s worth it to help others in the same situation

I love the results.  Where could I see more results with this doctor?  How much is the price of your surgery?

i’m an NHS patient so I never paid for the surgery just the travel costs I have no idea sorry :( I could barely find results from Tina when I was deciding there might be other girls here on this subreddit who’ve had surgery from her maybe?

Congratulations and Thank you so much for posting these !
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a month further along than you, had mine with Bellringer in November. Your issues with post op depression sound very familiar but they do get better. Take a look at my previous posts if you think it will help or just message me for a chat if you want.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very envious of your stitch marks, they are healing very very well. Do you have a pic of what they were like while the stitches were still in ? I only ask as mine are awful, Its a huge dark red V with dots either side and it&#39;s really worrying me that it will be like it forever :( from what I have seen it looks like Tina took a lot more care over the stitches than my surgeon did / mine look rushed and they are huge / done to be functional not pretty :(

hi! sorry i didn’t reply i had a rough day yesterday &amp; thank you 🤍
</p>
<p>
i never saw my stitches to be honest after surgery it was just like skin all round the stich area? i dont know how to explain it but it was like a bumpy skin
</p>
<p>
yep :/ post op depression is the worst and no one cares or tries to understand us
