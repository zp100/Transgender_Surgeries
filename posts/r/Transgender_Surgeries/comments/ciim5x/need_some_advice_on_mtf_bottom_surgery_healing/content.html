Hi :)
</p>
<p>
I had surgery bottom surgery (penile inversion with Dr Rasheed in the UK) exactly 2 months ago and was hoping I could find some peeps who&#39;ve had the same surgery and who can give me some advice as to what I can expect from healing :)
</p>
<p>
My surgery went well, and although I had an absolute fuck tonne of complications in the month after surgery, things have calmed down recently. Everything seems to be working well down there, I&#39;m pretty sensitive and was able to cum after only one month post op (although probably wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it that soon).
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically everything&#39;s looking pretty good, however I still have a lot of swelling in my labia majora - and by &#39;a lot of swelling&#39; I mean that I&#39;ve got one ridiculously serious case of camel toe going on. Can any ladies (and non-binary peeps) who have had this surgery give me a rough idea of how long before their swelling around the labia and the pubic mons region went down and / or roughly how many months was it before their junk mostly resembled the healed version ??Xx
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance Xxxx
</p>
<p>

Heya, thanks for the reply :) Are you saying that it took six to eight months for it to mostly resemble what it would when its healed, or 6/8 months just for the swelling in the labia to go down ?xxx

6-8 months for it to mostly resemble what it would when its healed.  But most of the swelling was in the labia, so it&#39;s kind of the same thing.  At 6 months it was very close to what it looks like now (2 years post-op).  The continued healing for 12 months was mostly the surgical scars continuing to fade away.

Probably not helpful, but I am one month and a week post OP, and one of my labia looks massive, while the other looks so sad and disappointed. It is weird :p Can&#39;t wait to know how it will look after this whole swelling business is done.

Sorry to ask but Iâ€™m possibly going to her. How much depth did she achieve?

I haven&#39;t properly measured but I think it&#39;s like 5.5 inches or a bit deeper. Dr Rasheed is  great, she&#39;s really nice and the team at Charring cross are all lovely. Obviously it&#39;s way too early to say for definite but so far I&#39;m really happy with the results xx

Swelling can take a while to subside. I had quite a bit for the first 6 weeks or so, after which it started subsiding enough to notice. I&#39;m coming up on 4 months post-op, and there is still some swelling, but it&#39;s
<em>
far
</em>
less than before. As someone else mentioned, it can easily take several months for all of the swelling to subside, and it takes a solid year for everything to fully heal and settle into place. At two months post-op, you&#39;ll probably start noticing the swelling going down over the coming weeks.

Awesome, thank you for the info :) xx Did you find anything that helped reduce the swelling, or did you just have to be patient ?xx

Wearing tight underwear will help keep the swelling down. I wore my regular underwear, but always had a pad to prevent blood stains (I only ever spotted in one little area on two pairs. There shouldn&#39;t be so much blood that it&#39;s getting all over your underwear.) Tight underwear prevents hematomas, and keeps swelling down really well. I was wearing a lot of boyshorts prior to GRS, so those worked perfect (they don&#39;t have edges right along the suture lines in your leg creases!)
</p>
<p>
Otherwise I was pretty religious with the ice pack. My hospital let me take home the one I&#39;d been using there. They&#39;re sort of a soft fabric-y outside, and hold a tray&#39;s worth of ice cubes perfectly. I used that a
<em>
lot
</em>
during the first week or two. You&#39;re not supposed to ice for more than 20-30 minutes at a time, but those particular ice packs don&#39;t seem to get cold enough for it to be a problem -- I&#39;d often just stick it between my crotch and let it stay there for an hour or two, or until the ice started to melt a little. If you&#39;re using something that&#39;s super-cold though, only do it for 20-30 minutes and then give it a rest for an hour or so before you ice again.
</p>
<p>
I also stayed on top of my pain meds, both opioid and non-narcotic (they sent me home with a bunch of prescription ibuprofen too.) NSAIDs like ibuprofen help with swelling, so I would take one as directed on the bottle, religiously. Sometimes I&#39;d switch it up and use Tylenol instead, but keep in mind that Tylenol doesn&#39;t affect swelling much. Also try to stick to the schedule with your opioids (assuming they sent you home with some), because if you let it go too long and things start hurting, you can end up in a fair bit of pain before the next one kicks in. IIRC I took an oxycodone every 4 or 6 hours (whatever the bottle said), without fail, for that first 10 days. After that my script ran out, but by then my pain was low enough that ibuprofen on its own took care of it.
</p>
<p>
After the first couple weeks this stuff becomes less of an issue and things get easier. But especially for the first 2-3 weeks, try to stay on top of this stuff as best you can, and you&#39;ll avoid excessive swelling or pain and feel better for it.
