based on everything I read, the only difference between peritoneum and colon is the composition of the liquid (electrolytes only =&gt; no smell) and the amount ( slightly less)
</p>
<p>
however, it is still constantly producing a transsudate.
</p>
<p>
personally I got Suporn meshed graft as it seemed the most conservative option (with fewer unknowns and variance), even if Chett could produce better visual results, and peritoneum was more promising (self lubrication, smooth visuals). I figured it could always be fixed later.
</p>
<p>
at this time, the best approach may be a mixed approach to have a small part of peritoneum to produce some lubrication only. Ideally, we will learn one day how to control the composition of the liquid to make it be lactic to support a natural flora, by doing some genetic manipulation of the grafted skin.

<p>
arousal might increase it, due to vasodilaton which seems to be why even some ppl with meshed graft report lubrication (I can confirm for my own personal case)
</p>
<p>
however, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to reduce it, except if you want to play with vasoconstrictive drugs, which I wouldn&#39;t recommend
</p>
<p>
but if you are game and can get your hand on daytime cold/cough syrup with ingredients that ends with &#34;ephrine&#34;, try to take that and report back here. take it as often as you would during a real cold.

<p>
it might contribute, especially if you feel aroused or have sexy thoughts during the day.
</p>
<p>
if you want to help orgasm,
<strong>
separately
</strong>
(don&#39;t mix drugs unless you know what you&#39;re doing!), take a few benadryl - like 3 to get started. when you get restless legs (like, socks or wide pants feel uncomfortable) that&#39;s when you should start bedroom activities :)  then, uh, report on the amount of lubrication you got! you should see how arousal and orgasm can create vasodilation, and help the transsudation.
</p>
<p>
it usually takes 1 to 2 hours to get that restless leg step. if you don&#39;t feel anything special in your legs, you didn&#39;t take enough. you can try to go for orgasm as is. but next time, take one more benadryl. don&#39;t go beyond 6 unless you know what you are doing. that should remove the arousal part from the equation and help you get a wonderfully strong orgasm. if you want to do multiple orgasm, I can recommend a few funny drugs (the same used to treat prolactinoma, you can get them from indian pharmacies)
</p>
<p>
now for that leakage, with the arousal problem removed, anything that cause vasoconstriction should work the same. problem is finding the right dose for a systemwide effect.. you should try simple stuff first so oral syrup that also acts on a &#34;stuck nose&#34; is as good as it gets especially if it doesn&#39;t contain acetaminophen (that&#39;s the most dangerous stuff. be super careful with that. if you absolutely can&#39;t find anything without it, add a 600 mg n acetyl cystein you can get from any vitamin shoppe or amazon, it will neutralize the acetaminophen and let you dose on the syrup)
</p>
<p>
sorry if it&#39;s a big long, I just want you to be able to experiment safely.
</p>
<p>
let me know how it worked, and I can suggest something else if it didn&#39;t. the goal is just to find something cheap you could easily access OTC/without a prescription in indian pharmas, to control the leak. so let&#39;s try safe and simple first
</p>
<p>
btw if by ampules you mean things that you inject or inhale, I wouldn&#39;t recommend that even topically bc it may be too efficient to the point of causing tachycardia

It may be an idea to make a post in
<a href="/r/DrWillPowers" rel="nofollow">this
</a>
sub. There might be a few people there that could help. He might also be interested because a number of other people may have similar issues, for example people with colon methods. Making a summary and sending a message might also be an option because a solution could improve treatment methods.
</p>
<p>
And asking at MTFHRT might also be an idea, there may be a few biochemists there.
</p>
<p>
Local application of t cream could be an option. it could help both with the t issue and it could also make for less lubrication. It may be necessary to try out, and it may be an idea to discuss various possible creams that could make for some change with the least side effects.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise you could try to concentrate on the healing process. You could try to do a few things that could help with healing, and it may be an idea to discuss options with a surgeon experienced with revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
might be one for example. It may be possible to discuss various possibilities to restore some nerve endings. There might be a number of techniques that could help. Many years ago surgeons did not create a clit and there may be some techniques that could work with existing tissue, I heard of people who tried to do that. Not getting hopes too high, just saying there may be techniques, and some people said they had some results.
</p>
<p>
And usually the prostate is left in place and can make for a pleasurable g/pspot. It is made of similar tissue as the gspot in cis people. The angle can play a role in this, it can be a few inches in, towards the belly. There are bent dildos that may help locate it so it may be possible to guide a partner later. Slow and deep strokes at an angle might be pleasurable for example. And it may be necessary to really be aroused beforehand. It may only be pleasurable if the spot is engorged.
</p>
<p>
And for scars a number of people use contractubex or cicaplast.
</p>
<p>
In general try to concentrate on positive things. Try to concentrate on some progess, try to find a few things you like. Otherwise it can be a feeling like getting sucked down. It may be possible to do the opposite and to try to look for positive things, and from there step by step work on resolving issue, one after the other.
</p>
<p>
A supportive therapist might also be helpful. They should know a number of coping strategies. As said trying to work out some kind of base with trying to concentrate on pos. things, and then resolving possible issues step by step might lead to a number of solutions.
</p>
<p>
Hope you find a few ways that work for you.

FYI plenty of cis women and trans men have constant discharge. I’m ftm and Ive had regular discharge since puberty. I mentioned it to a gyn when I was 16 and she said it was nothing to be concerned about. I always leave a wet spot on my underwear from it, it scared me during my teen years bcuz I often thought I had started my period but it was just discharge.
</p>
<p>
I never liked it, I’m looking forward to getting my vaginectomy so I don’t have to deal with it anymore, but it’s a normal thing. As far as I know there is no solution. Testosterone normally causes vaginal atrophy but two years on I’m still super soaker :/
</p>
<p>
If it doesn’t bother you too much I wouldn’t worry about it!

I&#39;m two months out from PPT and I have a similar issue. You can get panty liners which are a thinner version of pads that will at least be a little less obtrusive. Remember that many cis vaginas do the same thing, don&#39;t be discouraged!

About 5 months post-op PPV. I needed to wear pads for a little over 3 months, but now I don&#39;t leak at all unless I&#39;m getting turned on.
</p>
<p>
On the dysphoria bit, try to ride it out. You&#39;re at the point where post-op depression can start hitting really hard. I doubt you&#39;ll be stuck in pads for the rest of your life.

Most people I see talking about PPV either haven&#39;t had it themselves and are repeating things they read, or are fairly early on post-op. My girlfriend and I both had PPV. I don&#39;t leak currently, and she&#39;s almost past leaking herself. Most of the stuff coming out appears to be healing related.
</p>
<p>
Also worth noting many vagina having people have discharge, natal or otherwise. That&#39;s part of why panties have gussets. I do get a little bit of that, but nothing that&#39;s soaking or discoloring my underwear.

I think that depends on the clothes themselves more than anything else. Some dresses are see-through if the light hits them right. They make slips to wear under dresses like that.

Like blessing as far as self lubrication goes . My older sister has the same problem . She is cis but has a very wet vagina she always has panty liners on ... so blessing as far as you don’t need lube . Or do you ? I’m looking to go to Ting or BBL . I’d honestly prefer the overly wet vagina than a dry bat cave one honestly speaking . So is the post op vagina smoother because of hair removal or because it’s just smooth skin that’s used to construct it ? Either way congrats and hope this kinda helped .

I met a girl who had Dr. Ting&#39;s PPV technique. Yeah, she is self-lubricating ALL THE TIME!
</p>
<p>
She told me it never stops. She has to wear pads everyday and expects to have to for life.
</p>
<p>
Her words to me were, don&#39;t do it!
</p>

Saw this in another post from 340 days ago

Oh so it’s gotta be more common then we think! I wonder ... if only someone else with 100% ppv could shed some light . Have you reached out to Ting? Also do you feel comfortable sending pics at all ? Just like to see the aesthetic from ting . Only if comfortable of course no pressure

I&#39;ve dated several ciswomen who&#39;ve experienced varying amounts of &#34;leakage&#34; at all ages. It&#39;s far more prominent in women who&#39;ve given birth, but not exclusively. I find it so common that once I reach a certain stage in a relationship I&#39;ll suggest keeping a change of her clothes in my car when we go out in case she has an accident. I also get the most hilarious reactions when a ciswoman finds out that not only does it not gross me out, I&#39;m willing to plan on it happening.

Unexpected vaginal leakage, not necessarily bladder-related. I don&#39;t really ask for details but some blame it on arousal and some blame it on a sudden urge to urinate that can&#39;t be held for even a moment.

I have a question on this if the method of srs has given you leakage and constantly using pads does not agree with you could you use a menstrual cup instead? I&#39;ve.heard cis women talking of these just a thought Phylis💞
