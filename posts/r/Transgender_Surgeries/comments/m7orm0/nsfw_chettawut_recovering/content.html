Hello everyone, I make my surgery with Chettawut in february and now i&#39;m with 35 days post op. My question is about the region of the clitoris, i feel some sensibility under the skin like if my clitoris or the skin was moving around, and like its a little swells, sometimes there&#39;s a liquid on that area....with a smell that i dont know how to explain really....i&#39;m on the number 2 of the dilations, no weird smell inside of the vagina, just this part of my clitoris that seems to be i dont know, turn on all the time and wet...i talked with the chettawut team, but they said its normal...its healing well....anyway, i would like an information that someone that had some similar experience?
</p>

People say it takes quite some times to heal (months). Maybe dont touch it yet?

Hi, I&#39;m sorry to hijack, I saw your older post about going alone to Thailand and I was wondering how it went for you?

well....it was 80% ok....i think if it was my only option again, i was able to do the same, be alone etc...the aftercare of the nurse Sri, dr Chettawut it was very great...i said 80% ok because i had a lot of pain after they remove my packing and some blood that was because of pooped stitches and lonely seeing this things I was very afraid...and you add the missing of your family the things seems to be more hard....now i&#39;m in switzerland and the things start to be normal...i have some granulation tissue that the doctor told me that will disappear with time, i&#39;m now on 39 days post op and i have one side more swells than the other....i still have some yellow discharge and for sit its not 100% yet....but i really love my pussy :)

Thank you for answering
<br>
Would the nurse be taking care of you for the whole duration of stay in Thailand or would be just for the first week?
<br>
I hope you will have a speedy recovery.

She comes to the hotel everyday, just on the sunday that she dont come...unless you have your packing or catheter remove on the sunday, or one of the dilation supervised for her, she will visit you on the sunday...she comes untill the day you return home...i stay 24 days post op in thailand and she comes into the last day...it was very great....my recovering its going little more slowly i think....i saw others girls with the same time of me, 100% up for walk and sit....i&#39;m still walk little slowly and for sit it unconfortable after some time...but its going ok i can say....

Clits naturally produce smegma, so that&#39;s most likely what it is. Not sure why it would smell, but might just need to heal more before it&#39;s totally normal. Also clits still grow and shrink when you&#39;re aroused, could be that&#39;s what feels swollen
