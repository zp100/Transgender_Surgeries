I&#39;m keeping a diary of my time at GRS Montreal and sharing it here for you lovely folks to read. I&#39;ll answer any comments or questions I get. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.
</p>
<h1>

<p>
Before I let my emotions get the better of me, I&#39;ll keep things factual. Nothing much happened today. They organize a gathering every Friday so all the patients can meet up and talk about recovery and being trans etc. I had a minor scare from blood dripping while I was crapping, which turned out to just be leaking piss dripping through my blood-stained bandage. And they finally served a meal I didn&#39;t eat.
</p>
<p>
Today was probably a fine day, but right now I&#39;m in a foul mood so I&#39;m going to tell you how shitty this all is.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s shitty.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a whole heap of shittiness that someone pushed down a hill and set on fire.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m terrified to go to the bathroom. The nurses love that my piss is clear and I&#39;m shitting twice a day but I fucking don&#39;t. Because it hurts. Everything except lying down fucking hurts. And even lying down is a gamble.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t worry, they have pain meds, so long as you like nightmares üôÉ
</p>
<p>
And yes, I know I signed up for this. Yes, I know it&#39;s only temporary. No pain no glory. One day at a time. Blah blah blah. I don&#39;t give a shit. Right now, in this moment, my life sucks and I want to yell about it.
</p>
<p>
You want to know what the worst part is? Do you know how I usually cheer myself up after a bad day? MASTURBATE! I would just jerk my lil weiner that I don&#39;t have anymore! Satan is real and she is laughing at me.
</p>
<p>
Well fuck, you wanted honest, there it is. And I can&#39;t tell my friends or family or even my wife this; I&#39;ll just say &#34;Today was rough but tomorrow&#39;s another day&#34;. But thanks to breakthrough technology, I can now broadcast my mental breakdown straight into the hands of thousands of strangers I&#39;ll never meet. That&#39;s what you get for following me just for the titty pics. Now be a good little slut and hit the upvote button. Mommy need the dopamine.
</p>
<p>
Tantrum over.
</p>
<p>
Well probably not, but tune in tomorrow to find out.
</p>

Recover Day 4 (Spoiler: it got better):

You‚Äôre in it girl!  Yep you‚Äôre gonna have all sorts of feelings, all sorts of days.  I‚Äôm 2.5 months post op and I remember having a similar day post‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs not too much material available on the challenges to our mental health following surgery.  Thankfully pre surgery preparation and previous time and care spent on mental health during social transition - paid off during this period.  You‚Äôll be relying on your strength and fortitude through the healing process, and your new friend - dilation.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll raise a toast to dopamine this afternoon. ü•Çüçæ

The days from now until the bandages come off suck. It hurt to pee, and it hurt to poop. The only relief was ice, but I had to walk to get it. Which also sucked as everything hurt because I&#39;d just been to pee/poop. (I quickly learned to check I had enough ice before peeing!)
</p>
<p>
Once they remove the bandages and the stitch right next to your butthole you will feel so much better. (You might not be able to see it, but it is there!)
</p>
<p>
If you are having nightmares from the painkillers make sure the nurses know so they can try something else.
</p>
<p>
Just as a quick tip, the water from the machine downstairs is much nicer than the one upstairs.

Yeah no kidding, those first couple weeks suck shit. There were moments I asked myself how the fuck I could ever do it. But then some time around week four things cleared up and fuck did the colours ever get brighter. One day at a time, you got this shit!

I will be there in two months. I&#39;ve been thinking of scheduling an appointment with my therapist (online, obviously) for sometime on day 3 or maybe day 4 so that I have someone to vent to. Is that something that you considered? Any idea if the other girls there have done that? Thanks and hang in there, girl!
