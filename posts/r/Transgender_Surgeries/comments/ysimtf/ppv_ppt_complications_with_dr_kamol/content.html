If you ever get a revision i recommend Dr Theerapong he did my sigmoid colon i have a post on my account im 9 months post op now and pretty happy also he does revisions i do recommend going via Siam Transformative to dr Theerapong though because there is a language barrier with his stuff and you are gonna have to go to appointments , hospital by your self which is not the case if you go with Siam plus it works out to be about the same price.
</p>
<p>
Im sorry you had that experience Kamol is pretty much getting more bad reviews lately its scary.

Thanks, I&#39;ve emailed them. Why did you need a revision? I couldn&#39;t quite see on your posts. Did you have depth loss? Thanks üôè

Yep this has been my observation as well I have also visited Thailand last month and met another who had awful experience at same place. However it is completely wrong to tar all of Thailand with that reputation  In fact there are several well known surgeons who repair botch ups from all over world  PAI have been doing SRS for nearly 50 years and they must be doing things right as people keep going there  I ve seen several results from Sutin Burin etc and all very happy with results

There‚Äôs a large number of Thai surgeon reviews and photos in the wiki here, including Kamol.

You can probably remove hair at 4 cm, if you can find someone willing to work there. It‚Äôs near the limit though.
</p>
<p>
Granulation is a common complication and can often be treated non surgically. Have you tried?

<blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Theerapong does one serious surgery on his surgery day and goes home post op to relax
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I have heard from nurses that sometimes he does a short or minor operation on SRS days, but nothing more than that. Only does one SRS or revision a day (well, night, he likes to work when the hospital is quiet).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Theerapong is not running an entire private hospital with his wife like Kamol and dealing with the costs associated to keep it open - I haven&#39;t seen Dr. Theerapongs clinic , images look good not unlike Kamol&#39;s images but he does the serious surgeries in a Large normal hospital and smaller less complex surgeries in his clinic
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dr. T and I talked for hours in our consult as I was his last patient for the night and he was full of energy. I asked him why he doesn&#39;t set up his own place like some surgeons have, he says it&#39;s not worth the investment because it&#39;s cheaper to rent out an operating theater in hospitals and use their equipment and staff. His clinics are nice, but  cramped, the pictures give a false sense of how big the place is, everything is packed in very tight.
</p>
<p>
I think you&#39;ve made a good choice for a revision. One of the nurses at the hospital said that there were more people there getting a revision because of issues from other surgeons than cases like me doing it for the first time with Dr. T from the start. He does a lot of revisions and seems to have fun with the challenge of revisions as well as challenges himself to develop better surgical techniques - he&#39;s not stuck in a rut.

Hello, I am sorry to hear your SRS Kamol‚Äôs review. This is at least the third one with these negative complications and poor results. Here on reddit you can check other similar reviews. I hope you could find a solution to fix it.

Kamols approach to vaginoplasty is questionable at best‚Ä¶..his peritoneal approach doesnt compare to dr. Jun, dr. Bbl, dr. Zhao, dr. Djordjevic‚Ä¶..sorry yours didnt turn out as you want‚Ä¶,..

while ymmv somewhat, as a rule you can&#39;t regain depth that you&#39;ve lost. in most cases you can keep sizing up the width, but that can become difficult based on the amount of scar tissue. there are potentially revisions that could increase the size of the introitus.
</p>
<p>
usually the only way to increase depth is to basically have another vaginoplasty

My experience is different: Have 7 inches lengh and 4,2 cm diameter now, surgery April this year by Dr. Kamol. I started dilation with Nr 1, so pretty slim, but have widened it over the months as recommended. I now use other dildos cause the biggest dilator is not sufficient for european sizes. I will go up to 4,5cm in 8 weeks and this is perfect. Did slso had some granulom issues and bleeding, but this was normal according to my german urologist and often observed as there are many scares which have to heal.  I did the remove at Lubos Klinic in Germany. Not due to a lag of trust but just as i had no time to travel to Bangkok and this clinik is specialized on transgenders in Germany.  Results were perfect. By the way, did also my FFS and adams apple surgery at Kamol Hospital at the same time with perfect results. Will be there again in April to May 23 for my breast augmentation, facelift after FFS, eyes and lips. I think opinions here can mislead somewhat: Risks of surgeries are a reality, lets face it,  but people with negative experience often write much more than people who are happy. So dont be biased. If I would have to decide again, I would decide for Dr.. Kamol again. One short recommendation: the Kamols dilators are hard plastic. Its better to use flexible dildos as it is much smarter for your body, causes less harm and feels much better. Happy weekend to all. Emilia

About ten weeks, however it started rapidly when I went up dialator sizes. Likely because the tunnel he made wasn&#39;t wide enough from the start
