As promised here‚Äôs part 3 of my journey so far with bottom surgery. If you haven‚Äôt seen part 2
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/s/LRZcSYELCY">here‚Äôs the link to it</a>
where you can check out what‚Äôs happened so far. But without further ado, here we go!
</p>
<p>
Waking up from surgery:
</p>
<p>
I remember waking up from the anesthesia in what looked like another holding room but for after the surgery, everything was blurry and I just remembered the sharpest pain down there and I was crying out from the pain and shivering from the anesthesia. My exact memories after that was scrambled but they assured me that the pain would fade in a moment. And that‚Äôs when I remember the pain somehow going from all over down there with stinging pain to what felt like a dull-ish pain that was still strong. They finished what I guess was my paperwork since they were on a computer putting in some last bits of stuff and then started wheeling me into my recovery room. They got me hooked up to my IVs and what felt like my epidural again as I felt a cool sensation starting from the lower part of my back that spread down to my lower half and instantly the pain went away. I passed out from exhaustion of what just happened and went to sleep after they got all my vitals and everything.
</p>
<p>
I remember waking up not too long after with the small hum of something in the recovery room and the lights on. I looked out the window of the room and saw a building next to me and started to get a feel of the room I was in finally. Not too long after that a nurse came in and asked about my pain levels and checked my vitals again and once that was all done I laid there for a handful of minutes until I pulled off the blankets slightly and looked down at my groin area to notice I had the dresssing on and instantly started crying a little with joy. That‚Äôs when I knew it wasn‚Äôt a dream. I was finally on the other side of the surgery. I had done it.
</p>
<p>
My sister and my girlfriend came back to visit not long after and checked in on me. I broke down crying with joy seeing them and I hugged them both to the best of my ability while in bed and told them about things after they were left behind. I called everyone and said I did it and then hung out with my sister and my girlfriend for a couple of hours until they headed back to the AirBnB for the night. I went back to sleep and slept pretty much through the rest of the day and night with nurses coming in to check my vitals every few hours.
</p>
<p>
Recovery Day 1:
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm calling this day 1 as the day of surgery on the nurses terms was day 0. At this point I woke up to moderate pain which was taken care of pretty quick with some oxy. After that they ran vitals and got me acquainted to the timeline after the surgery and what to expect. They told me about the epidural and the catheter and after making sure I got all my questions answered told me to get some rest as it would be just a day of rest. Katie came in and checked in on me as well and again asked if I had any questions that I had and then headed back out. I am NOT the kind of girl to just lay in bed all day so I tossed and turned a lot and tried to occupy myself on my phone while being in and out of my pain meds. My sister and my girlfriend came to visit again and caught me up with things on their end and we hung out for a few more hours and I ordered food with room service. I‚Äôve never had hospital food but I will say it‚Äôs GOOD! At least here it was. I had my first bowel movement and since I was still ordered to stay in bed for the day my nurse helped me with getting the bed pan set and I used it which I felt really embarrassed about but everyone told me it was okay. After they left I felt a huge rush of exhaustion and called it for the day when it came to trying to stay up for anything after that. I slept again on and off every few hours as they had to come in and check my vitals and then finally woke up fully around 3 or 4 in the morning after tossing and turning again. I had to use the bathroom again as I was having another bowel movement and refused to use the bedpan again. So since I knew the next day was going to be me waking I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and started to see what I needed to do to get walking so I could just use the bathroom in the recovery room without having to use a bedpan as I REFUSED to do that again. After seeing how to unhook my IV to move it around and getting the leg straps to help with blood clots taken off I got ready to hop off the bed. I slowly and carefully inched off the bed and made contact with the ground. It felt SO relieving touching a floor for the first time in a couple of days. I waddled with my IV and catheter bag to the bathroom and did my business and came out of that bathroom feeling like I could take on anything! But that was going to be for tomorrow because I instantly felt tired again! I crawled back into bed after getting everything situated again and got wrapped back up in my blankets and went back to sleep.
</p>
<p>
Recovery Day 2:
</p>
<p>
So this leads up to what happens yesterday technically since it‚Äôs 3 am again! I just emptied my catheter bag since found out how to do that and cleaned up a little. It was mostly just me getting used to walking again with my packing in. Ramineni came in that morning and came in to tell me I have great depth and that everything went well. Then he helped me get the dressing off of my coochie and then helped me put on pads and medical panties. Getting to see my new coochie gave me another rush of joy that I ended up crying again from and then got ready for the rest of the day. A nurse came by to remove my epidural and she was very surprised as it was already out and asked if I had any pain from it and I said no and she was really surprised and said I was a tough one since it looked like it was off for a while and I didn‚Äôt even need that much pain meds the day before except for around nighttime. I met with my Physical Therapist and finally started walking. If was a little odd at first since the packing is pretty noticeable when walking but I got used to it and made laps around the floor of my recovery room and then went up my first set of a few stairs and made it up no problem! I met with my sister and girlfriend and proposed to my girlfriend and she was bawling her eyes out and said yes! After that the day went like yesterday. Once everyone left again and I ate I went back to sleep.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm still sleeping on and off so for right now but tomorow will be discharge day! I‚Äôll update everyone on that tomorrow!

Such a beautiful story.  Congratulations on both big events.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery the day before yours.  They should really put all the Ramineni patients together.  It would have been nice to talk to others instead of the mind numbing laying in bed.  Great to hear your recovery is going well.

Surgery was on the 24th, I was discharged on the 27th.  I was on the 5th floor as well.  They had me walking on the 26th.  If you noticed a tall blond walking the halls with my IV cart, that was me.  I kept doing loops around the halls until they encouraged me to rest in bed.
</p>
<p>
I had the packing and catheter out yesterday morning.  Dilation is a interesting thing.  I&#39;m happy to talk over DM if you would like.

OMG THAT WAS YOU! I saw someone walking around and I assumed it was another girl who got surgery but didn‚Äôt want to just go off of suspicion! Did you notice a girl with locs that were purple at the ends?
