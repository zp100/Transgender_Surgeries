There&#39;s Christopher Inglefield in London. Consistent results and no botched patients.

Consistently unspectacular results for twice the price of Facial Team.  He&#39;s a generalist, not a specialist.

They had a very good reason for rejecting you.  They think your expectations are unreasonable (and that you&#39;ll therefore be unsatisfied), so they won&#39;t put themselves in that position.
</p>
<p>
You clearly asked for results that they aren&#39;t prepared to attempt, so move along to a different surgical team.

I would just say that I’ve done four Skype consultations with Facialteam (including three different surgeons) and asked all manner of questions of their technique and my concerns, etc..  All of the surgeons answered my questions patiently and seemed very open about their reasoning for doing the surgery the way they do it.  I’ve also consulted with three other FFS surgeons who do things differently and don’t agree with Facialteam’s approach.
</p>
<p>
Maybe consult with some US surgeons?   Toby Mayer is similar in price to Facialteam and has more experience than anyone doing FFS.  I’ve decided to go with Facialteam, but Mayer was my second choice.  He doesn’t perform type III forehead reconstruction,  but claims he can do type I on most women and achieve the same results?  I’m not sure I buy that, but shop around.  I hope you can find someone who will help you get the results you want.  For me, I want the more subtle approach of Facialteam, over the dramatic results that some are looking for.

Mayer is in Los Angeles, CA, and I think you already know Facialteam is in Spain.   That said, I think reports of violence in the US probably give us a more worrisome reputation than is really warranted. Granted, we had another mass shooting yesterday, but when you consider the overall size of the US and its population, and put the violence in proportion to population, it isn’t all that likely you will run into it.  And even in my little mountain town, I have been treated very well by law enforcement and the legal system.  That said, I’m in California, not the Deep South (which could be a very different story).  But most of the FFS surgeons in the US are on the West Coast or East Coast, where police and people in general are “relatively” accepting of LGBTQ people, but more importantly where laws are very good at protecting trans rights (even in rural Nevada, state law protects my right to employment, housing, and trans related health care).
</p>
<p>
So it varies based on state, but if you go to San Francisco, it’s a relatively peaceful city with the common problems of major urban areas (poverty, etc.).  That said, I walked around the city for hours with my ten year old and thirteen year old sons without any really worry for our safety.

On the other hand, everyone who is an honest American knows that they are originally a foreigner, so there is something about that Statue of Liberty (gifted by France) that still speaks to me of a country that I am proud of (see Emma Lazurus’s poem, The New Colossus).  And still we need to do so much better by our indigenous population and the historical displacement and eradication of their ancestors.  And we need to do better to address a lot of the inequality still woven into our social fabric.
</p>
<p>
But overall, I still value this country.  And many places in Europe are doing worse in pursuing equal rights for trans people (thanks in part to JK Rowling and the other terfs like her).
