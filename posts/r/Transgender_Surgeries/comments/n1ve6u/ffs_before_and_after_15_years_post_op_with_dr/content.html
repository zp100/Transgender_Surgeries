I&#39;ve been reading this sub to death lately before my GRS with Dr. Bluebond-Langner, but have been hesitant to post something so personal. But I&#39;m over it, so here it is.
</p>
<p>
I had hairline advancement, brow ridge reduction, brow lift, rhinoplasty, T genioplasty, and jaw reduction/countouring in NYC with Dr. Harrison Lee. I went with exactly what Dr. Lee suggested in our consult.
</p>
<p>
It was one of two surgeries I&#39;m having (GRS very soon!) and easily the most life changing milestone in my transition so far. A friend of mine had amazing results and recommended Dr. Lee, and I couldn&#39;t be happier with his work.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer questions too!

If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how old were you when you started your transition? How old are you now? I ask because even before the surgery you were softer than cotton as relates to your appearance.

One of the reasons I was confident going with him is because he is willing to be a bit more aggressive. I was worried with other surgeons I had looked into that I would get more mild results, especially with my chin and jaw. I&#39;m very happy I went with Lee. I think he has a vision when he sees your face in the consult, and I was totally on board so I let him work his magic. He described exactly why he thought I should do each procedure and what his goal was. It was like watching him paint a picture, and, having seen his work in person and in pictures, I was sold.
</p>
<p>
Brow ridge is one of the more expensive procedures. Any time they&#39;re removing and contouring bone, it&#39;s expensive. I can&#39;t recall the exact price for brow ridge specifically.

I&#39;d like to ask you about your hairline advancement. It&#39;s been recommended against for me because it puts &#34;stress on the scar.&#34; I have a much higher, much more M-shaped hairline than you did in your before pictures, though.
</p>
<p>
Any chance you could speak to that specific procedure or whether or not you experienced anything like that?

I didn&#39;t feel any pressure on the scar personally. My scar healed normally with the help of silicone gel and didn&#39;t move or reopen. Also Dr. Lee makes the incision at an angle so that hair will grow through the scar afterwards, totally covering it up.

Thank you! I will be sure to ask about this possibility when I speak with my surgeon next month, and see if it&#39;s right for me.

<p>
Your results are fantastic, thank you so much for sharing, it helps everyone so much. Good luck on your upcoming surgery!!

You look gorgeous girl! After seeing your results definitely makes me want to have him do my FFS. How long were you on HRT before having surgery and how long did you have to wait after your consult?

I was on HRT full time for about 2 years before surgery. I had my consult and was ready to pay that day, so he was able to schedule me only a month out.

Very subtle actually and I had to have a close look, not a dramatic change like I see in many.   It looks really good and happy you are very pleased with the end result.  I’ve personally done small things that no one would ever notice but I was really pleased with myself.   Note : I’ve never had FFS.

Thanks girl! It&#39;s totally invisible and behind the hairline. He did the incision at an angle so hair would grow through the scar. I used the silicone scar gel he provided 2x a day for about 4 months, and it worked like a charm. Good luck with surgery!

Thank you! I don&#39;t want to share the exact cost, but the numbers I usually see on here for similar procedures are about right. The best way to find out cost for your surgery is to have a consult and he will give you an itemized quote! I didn&#39;t have a model of what I might look like. Just my imagination while Dr. Lee described it to me :)

Ugh! I can’t wait to see him. He does the best work on all scales. My gfs look amazing. Some look like show girls , some look cis, “It’s amazing what paint and a Surgeon could do” - Crystal Connors 🖤 would you mind giving us a procedure list? I want to go for forehead and jaw.

There&#39;s a difference between constructive criticism and then just being downright mean. This comment was totally uncalled for, and her brows honestly look lovely.

I think my brows were too low and flat before. Especially obvious in the third picture. I&#39;m very satisfied with my brows, but to each their own.

Thank you! Lol I&#39;m more of an elliptical, booty, and abs girl. I used to run 5 miles a day early in transition, and before transition I did weight training and/or ran 6 days a week.

I was wondering if you&#39;d consider sharing some of your post operative recovery experiences? How long did it take for things to really &#34;settle&#34; for you and when you felt sensations return to parts of your scalp and face? This is a phenomenal result! Very happy for you!

So after about 3 months it felt like it was about 80% of the way there. Even before that, after about 2 weeks I was already looking better than before surgery imo. The rest finished up slowly up to about 1-1.5 years to be fully settled. My scalp took at least 1 year to really feel normal (with some random, occasional itchiness continuing for awhile). It feels totally normal at this point. On one side of my chin, I felt a pressure/tightness for a full year and a half at least. It wasn&#39;t painful or uncomfortable, but it was noticeable when I focused on it. I think this was the side that had the most bone removed due to asymmetry before surgery. I eventually started icing it again and massaging the area and the swelling or whatever it was went away.
</p>
<p>
My only scars are in my mouth and my hairline. The hairline scar became effectively invisible by about 4-5 months. I used the silicone scar gel he provided every day. Also his method with the hairline advancement makes it so hair grows through the scar, covering it up completely. The scar in my mouth is just around the bottom in front of my teeth. I can&#39;t see it, but I can feel the scar line with my tongue.

Looks extremely good. Your surgeon is gifted. My hairline scar was so much worse and I had to get it covered with a hair transplant.

I know this might be a stupid question, but you didn&#39;t turn up with literal cash did you? One of the things that I never see talked about is how payment is dealt with when my currency differs from the surgeons currency.

No stupid questions! There are multiple ways to pay. Credit/debit cards and bank checks come to mind. Personal checks likely wouldn’t be accepted. I don’t think he would have accepted a stack of $100 bills for safety reasons :). I’m not sure what country you are from, but see what options your bank has for forex

The first night was painful, and it took forever to get to sleep. I had nausea from the rhinoplasty, but it passed and I got some sleep. The first 4-5 days after that were uncomfortable, but pain medication made it manageable. By around a week the discomfort was pretty mild, and around 10 days I stopped taking tylenol/advil. I could only drink smoothies and had to avoid salt. As a vegan who really loves fruits and veggies, I got super sick of smoothies. As soon as I started taking Spironolactone again I had major salt cravings. It was also frustrating to have limited movement. I had a few times where I got overwhelmed and frustrated with the discomfort and limited movement and cried for awhile.
</p>
<p>
It was really hard, but it was over before I knew it. I would do it all again without a second thought. I was lucky to have my Mom with me for the first week at least, and she made it a lot easier.

Hey, I got a few questions for you. First question is when did you start hrt? Second question is if you used puberty blockers and if you have at which age did you start? Third question is if your sexual orientation changed with the use of hrt? And the fourth question is what is your height and shoe size? I am currently thinking about transitioning but I don&#39;t know if it is too late for me to transition and I also want to pass but I am too tall and my shoe size is so big, because of those reasons I am afraid that I might not be able to pass.

Thank you so much! I am having bottom surgery with Dr. Bluebond-Langner in September, and I think that will be it. At some point I might get a tracheal shave from Dr. Lee. I’m not too concerned about it since my Adam’s apple isn’t prominent, but it might be a good final touch :)
