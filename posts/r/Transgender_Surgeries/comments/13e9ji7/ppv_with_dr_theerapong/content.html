I had PPV surgery with Dr. Theerapong on Friday.  It has been a very long and hard week during the recovery, especially with not being allowed to leave the bed at all during that time but this morning the reveal finally happened!!! I will get photos on another post, lots of clean up to do first. But so far so good. Lots of swelling right now and my labia is a little short because I was circumcised. He put the dilator in after removing everything and it looks like I have 8 inches of depth! Definitely more than I expected so that&#39;s exciting! I will provide another post in the coming weeks with further information. Right now I just am getting ready for my second pee so that I can be discharged.

Feel free to pm me for questions!

He is who I&#39;m going with! I have heard ppv fail fairly often. What is his success rate with it?

I can&#39;t speak for certain about his success rate but I did ask how many times revisions were needed for his clients. The answer was only 1, and that one didn&#39;t really need revision but wanted it because the aftercare wasn&#39;t done correctly and there was a problem with a stitch coming out early that caused a small undesirable look for the client. Dr Thee is often the one during revisions from other surgeons because he does such a good job. It&#39;s still too early to give a final assessment of my results but I&#39;m optimistic that he did the best possible work for me based on what was available to start with. In my opinion at this time, the most important thing if you have a good surgeon is to make sure you also have a really good aftercare nurse to help with all stitches and scarring. That is huge for a truly successful result.

Amazing! Thank you for this thorough reply. Did you all discuss what lubrication his ppt patients have experienced.

It was not discussed before the surgery. But everyone is different. Some PPV have lots of lubrication while others not so much. Even penile inversion can have lubrication. It varies so much among people, how their bodies are configured, their lifestyle, even what you eat can probably impact it.
