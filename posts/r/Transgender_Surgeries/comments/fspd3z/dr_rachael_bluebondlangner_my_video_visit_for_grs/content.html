</p>
<p>
Today, (Edit: 03/31/2020) I had my GRS consult with Dr. Bluebond-Langner and members of her team via video visit. She and her team members are consummate professionals and are so easy to talk with. I prepared ahead by making a list of my questions and had answers to every single one by the time the appointment ended.
</p>
<p>
The appointment started with a member of the Urology team, Dr. Jun, who touched base with the usual questions, age, medical history, prior surgeries, allergies, sexual partners/history, etc. He asked what my plan was for support and after-care following the surgery. Dr. Jun specifically asked about my endocrinologist, my primary and therapist Dr&#39;s. and their letters. Even though I sent copies of my letters in my package, they had not been scanned into the system and he did not have access.
</p>
<p>
Next, he took some time to describe the GRS surgery in general, the urology portion specifically and how they work in unison with Dr. RBb-L during the procedure. He spoke of what makes up the clitoris, and construction of the vaginal canal, labia, and detailed the robotic portion of the surgery. Turns out the urology team performs the bulk of the internal surgery. To be honest, he answered most of the questions on my list without me even having to ask. He explained what to expect post-surgery in the hospital, dilation, catheter, urinating, etc. He explained that because I&#39;m from out of state, I would be required to stay a minimum of two weeks post discharge within a 100 mile radius of the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Then it was time to ask questions. I had a list of 34 questions written and honestly, he already answered most of them. I asked if the office had a diagram or written instructions detailing the area required to have hair removal. Dr. Jun said they were working on that and described that basically all the hair around the base of the penis and everything from that point, down to the anus must be removed. He was very clear that ALL the hair down to the anus had to be cleared. I explained I had appointments scheduled with the Papillon Center in New Hope and he expressed satisfaction with that plan.
</p>
<p>
I asked him specifically if Dr. RBb-L did
<em>
not
</em>
perform surgery on patients who previously underwent an orchiectomy. He told me that was
<em>
not
</em>
true. I asked what difference in the procedure would it make due to my prior orchie. He explained that it only makes the difference of about 3-minutes in the total time for surgery. He clarified the complete removal of the erectile tissue and explained how the scrotal tissue is utilized. I specifically asked about the vaginal opening falling within the labia minora and this was confirmed. I asked about the labia majora extending to and meeting at the bottom, below the opening. This was confirmed, with the caveat that it does depend on how much scrotal tissue there is to work with. When he finished answering my questions, Dr. Jun explained he was going to brief Dr. RBb-L and Dr. Zhao and they would be next up in the video.
</p>
<p>
Exit Dr. Jun . . .   After about 10-minutes, Dr. RBb-L joined the video session. She was very friendly and easy to speak with. She immediately made me feel comfortable. Dr. Zhao was in the background and waved at the camera and said Hello when she introduced him. She started by confirming some of the previous medical information and specifically asked about my letters. When I told her I had electronic copies, she asked me to upload them today. (I did). Dr. RBb-L briefly detailed her surgery team, how they work and her part in the surgery. She covered what to expect in recovery and spoke about dilation. She made it clear that I needed to plan for and have enough funds on hand to cover living expenses for the three weeks stay (minimum, depending on how smooth the recovery goes). She gave me a chance to ask questions and assured me specifically about where the vaginal opening falls within the labia and what to expect for my outcome. She did not show any pictures of her work.
</p>
<p>
I asked if my wife can attend my next appointment for the physical exam and she was enthusiastic in her affirmation. (Edit: I asked how long before surgery did she require for the healing process after final genital electrolysis. She responded, 3-weeks). As a next to final question, I asked what music they listened to during the surgery. She was surprised by the question, but explained they rotated among the team as to what each of the members preferred. I asked if I could choose a song to go to sleep by and was told yes. Dr. RBb-L reiterated about uploading the letters and told me they would be calling me with a date for surgery. That was the end of the video appointment.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps. AMA. I obviously made the right choice to seek surgery with Dr. RBb-L and her team. A LOT of RBb-L women on this sub have raved about her and her team and everything I experienced today only supported all I&#39;ve read. I am excited about what is to come and if provided the opportunity, I am ready to jump up on the table today.

That&#39;s great. I&#39;m glad everything worked out well. Do you mind sharing your list of questions? I should be having my consult with another surgeon in July, and I want to be prepared.

Dr. Jun was very clear to describe that all the available tissue down to the anus is utilized and stressed I did not want hair growing in my vagina.

At the moment, toss up. Shania Twain, ‚ÄúMan! I Feel Like A Woman‚Äù, John Fogerty, ‚ÄúCenterfield‚Äù, or Janis Joplin, ‚ÄúMe &amp; Bobby McGee‚Äù (Edit) Lady Gaga, ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Today, at the end of my meeting with Dr. RBb-L I told her I wanted to finish the interview by quoting from the refrain in the song Centerfield. She smiled, seemed to know the song and said sure. So I looked her straight in the eye and I told her ‚ÄúPut me in Coach, I‚Äôm ready to play, today. Look at me, I can be, Centerfield.‚Äù She got a real kick out of that and told me she really liked that. In my opinion, it was a nice ending to a good interview.

I&#39;ve been hoping to set up my own consultation with her. Do you know if she has a cap on the BMI she&#39;ll work with? I looked into McGinn, and while I&#39;d like to lose weight, I&#39;m not sure I want surgery to be put on hold until I can manage to dump 60 pounds. :-/ I&#39;ve already waited decades trying to figure myself out.

One of my final questions was ‚ÄúWhen would I be told I was accepted as a patient.‚Äù Dr. RBb-L specifically stated I was at ideal body weight and I was a patient. There are other Dr. RBb-L women I am in touch with who have shared they were required to lose weight prior to surgery because it significantly increases the chance for a successful recovery/outcome.

How important a factor is weight?  I&#39;m on the skinny side; you mention you&#39;re at the ideal body weight (for surgery?) - is there a &#34;too thin&#34; for this, within reason?  I&#39;m skinny but not skeletal (5&#39;9&#34; 150#).

It‚Äôs best to make a new post, just like this one, and include a link back to the previous post so people can find it easily. The edit your old post to link to the new one so people who find the old one can easily find the updates.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done in this series of posts to link them all together.

Dr. RBb-L did not go into detail about the whole dilation regimen. She spoke specifically about immediately after the packing is removed on Day-5, which starts the process with 4-times per day at 15-minute intervals each.

Dr RBL&#39;s prescribed dilation schedule is, for the first 6 weeks, 4x per day, at least 3 or 4 hours apart, for 15 minutes.

I did not have all my letters when I applied for an appointment. The thought was that due to the length of time from applying and consult, at least get on the schedule and catch up with the paperwork by the time of consult. I posted links that will answer several of your questions.
</p>
<p>
Tips: Get your surgery package completed and submitted as rapidly as possible. In my opinion, until the office receives your package, you are just a name on a list.
</p>
<p>
I have no direct knowledge of what the COVID-19 virus has done to their operations. My sense is that, like everyone else they are scrambling to adjust as quickly as they can.

I started laser hair removal....where exactly do most people have their genital hair removed, like the entire area?  Do you leave any hair there in that region, like on pubic mound? I might like a cute little patch. Thank you üòä

I‚Äôm having all penile hair down to the base and approximately 1/4‚Äù up the mons pubis, all scrotal hair, and (imagine, as a way to describe) a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape wedge from the top of the scrotum, running inside the groin crease down to the anus. This is based on a diagram Dr. RBbL‚Äôs office sent me.
</p>
<p>
I have a third round of electrolysis later this month and will allow the remaining hair to grow out in time for the physical exam by Dr. RBbL next month. This will allow her to see what has been permanently removed and tell me exactly what other (if any) hair has to go. I‚Äôm hoping this third round finishes clearing all the areas needed.

I see, so they gave you a diagram as a guide.
<br>
My gosh, I can&#39;t even imagine the sensitivity in that area.
</p>
<p>
Do you use numbing cream? Any would you suggest laser in combo with electrolysis?
