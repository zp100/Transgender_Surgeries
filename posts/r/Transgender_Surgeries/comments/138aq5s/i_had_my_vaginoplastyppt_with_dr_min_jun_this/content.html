I had my vaginoplasty(ppt) with Dr Min Jun this morning, went into surgery at 7:30am woke up around 3:30pm. He said everything went well, i have no pain other than some stomach cramps, have a full feeling like I ate a lot of food and my shoulder being a little sore. I am in my room now with my partner they’re able to stay overnight with me, I had no issues with eating or drinking, currently relaxing and watching Dr Strange and The Multiverse of Madness on the tv. I am feeling great, euphoric and so so happy right now. 🤭☺️😺

The shoulder being sore is from gas/air in your abdomen, this is fairly common and will go away in a week or 2 on its own. Congrats, Min Jun is one of my favorite US surgeons!

Yeah the shoulder thing I was aware of didn’t think it was going hurt like it did though, it’s gotten better, felt like a hurt muscle that I just couldn’t massage to make it go away. I love Dr Min Jun he has been so great from the beginning and his aesthetics is why I went to him, also location wise it worked out perfectly.

Omg congrats as well, thats so exciting.☺️
</p>
<p>
He’s been wonderful, I don’t see how anyone can have a bad encounter with him, I have felt nothing but comfort with him from consult until surgery day, and his PA Alex is wonderful as well.

Honestly I was hung up with having the extra incisions but after watching the 1hr q&amp;a before consult, I was sold. I really think the peritoneal version just makes the most sense.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so happy for you! (A little jealous 😅) But Jan is fast approaching and there&#39;s still a bit of electrolysis to finish. What a great time doing that 🙃

PPT is less risky than PI which is also why I went with this method I wasn’t to worried about the incisions, also wanted my surgery with Min Jun. i was looking Into him before I was 100% sure I was going to have this surgery. I had other surgeons in mind, but his aesthetics and stitch work sold it for me, no need to feel a little jealous January will be here before you know it, it flew by for me. The waiting part sucks I know, I’m so impatient lol

Why is PPT less risky then PI? I had never heard that before.
</p>
<p>
He is also on the top of my list. I&#39;m having an orchi at UCSF in 33 days. So excited.
</p>
<p>
Maybe next year I will be in a better place to have full GRS.

Because with PPT Dr Jun is creating the canal from the inside of the stomach so he’s able to see everything with the robot and with PI you’re creating the canal from the outside without being able to see everything, which can increase the risk of puncturing the rectum or other areas while creating the canal. Dr Jun explains why he prefers ppt and talks about the risks. They both have risks but the robot helps lower those risks.

Oh ok. I had heard that before but I did not think of it as &#34;riskier&#34; just a different path to make the canal. How much of the canal is made from the peritoneum verses penis/scrotum?
</p>
<p>
Is the same amount of hair removal required? That is what held me back from getting GRS now instead of just an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
I wish you quick and problem free recovery.

Dr Jun recommends anywhere from 6-9 months of hair removal. he also does a follicle scrape during surgery, he said getting laser hair removal first helps speed things up and won’t have to have so much electrolysis done. I had like 3 sessions of laser and then about 6 months of electrolysis and I was fully clear. The first half of the canal is from scrotal tissue and then the back half is peritoneum.

Thank you so much. The wait time will change as long as you have all your letters in and have started hair removal. Almost everyone gets bumped up if you have everything in. I got my surgery date quick after my consult because I had everything prepared beforehand.

I was very late starting hair removal and missed out on an early availability because of that. I now have to wait till Sep due to FFS in 2 weeks and they&#39;re telling me next available after that is March. 😔

Don’t let that time get you down. You can still get an earlier date if something comes available, depends on cancellations or if Dr Jun gets more dates with the Robot, as long as you wait 3 months after FFS, just be patient, I know the waiting game sucks but you’ll get to that big day.

Big congrats on your surgery, I have minimal depth vulvoplasty scheduled for this September with Dr. Jun. Love seeing so many happy girls posting their Jun results!
