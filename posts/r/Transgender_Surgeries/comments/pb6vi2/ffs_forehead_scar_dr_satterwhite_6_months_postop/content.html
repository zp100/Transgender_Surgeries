Wanted to post an update now that I&#39;m 6 months and 1 laser treatment later. Scar still looks terrible. Slight improvement in redness. No improvement in texture. Losing hope that this is ever going to fade to be not noticeable. The redness might completely disappear, but it&#39;s not really any better for it to turn white. And the texture is awful and doesn&#39;t blend in at all. Here it is:

Second angle in more natural lighting, (since people doubt that it actually looks like shit apparently):

</p>
<p>
I&#39;m honestly regretting having a second FFS now. I don&#39;t think the subtle change was worth looking like the Bride of Frankenstein forever, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m headed.
</p>
<p>
Update:  On a related note: This is my first time posting here in a few months, but why do people post confrontational, gaslighting and just straight-up unhelpful comments now? What happened to this sub? The first two comments were essentially &#34;i can&#39;t see it!&#34; (Get your eyes checked then) I mean, the surgeon himself referred to it as &#39;unsightly&#39; but what does he know right? Smh... or &#34;well, it could be worse!&#34; Fucking really? No shit. Get a life! Have some empathy maybe? I really don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m thought to be irrational for being upset about this. If you had surgery to correct a problem but wound up with a different problem, you&#39;d be pissed right? I&#39;m still self-conscious. Maybe even more so now than before.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really posting this so people know it&#39;s possible to have bad scarring and to maybe see what others in my position have tried. I didn&#39;t ask for your advice or opinions. What are you all, the botched surgery connoisseurs? Sorry my mutilation didn&#39;t make you audibly gasp. I don&#39;t need any more moronic comments now, thanks.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this will be my last time posting here. I&#39;ll leave my account active because maybe my posts can help someone (oh wait, no one reads anything more than a day old right? smh), and I&#39;ll check back for about a week or so to reply to comments. But I don&#39;t need any more idiots in my life who think they know everything. It&#39;s never fun when baby transitioners think they know more than someone who&#39;s been transitioned for like 10+ years...  Take care!
</p>

My original post is here, which has the pics from about 2-3 months ago if you&#39;re lazy:

Honestly I&#39;m sorry you have to deal with this. Have you looked into getting hair transplants just to cover the scar? I&#39;ve seet it with other people having the same issue. Hair transplants might be something you could benefit from.

Like I said. If it was just the discoloration I don&#39;t think it would be all that noticable. But the problem is that it dips into my skin. It&#39;s like someone carved a little trench into my hairline. Hair transplants cost 10k.... And there&#39;s no guarantee they&#39;ll hold in the scar tissue as the follicles in that area are pretty much destroyed. I&#39;d have to take out a loan to cover it. And then I&#39;m still only basically moving the scar to the back of my head. I&#39;ll for sure look into it, but I think it&#39;s in &#39;last resort&#39; territory. It will take me years to save that amount.

Have you tried prescription strength hydroquinone cream used in conjunction  prescription retinol? The retinol will help improve skin texture and the hydroquinone will fade things.

Ask a dermatologist. Find out if CO2 laser treatment can help, or I have read about injections that remove scarring by using enzymes to dissolve connective tissue or something. Maybe another surgery is not needed. Hope you find a way out and fix the problem. ;)

I don&#39;t have anything relevant to say other than I&#39;m so sorry, and thank goodness the PA convinced me NOT to have hairline advancement with Satterwhite. I didn&#39;t have great results with my top surgery, though, and apparently need a revision now, so I feel for you.

It might just be the picture but I really don’t think this scar is very noticeable. Certainly you could bring your makeup up further into your hairline and make it disappear. I think this is a case of the thing where dysphoria makes us see things that aren’t there.

like I haven&#39;t been trying that for the last 3 months...

<p>
NOPE. Concealer does not cover it. It&#39;s indented into my skin. Also, even if that was the case... gee wow. I can look forward to wearing concealer every moment of every day, forever. Great... lol

dysphoria deals with seeing GENDERED body image. It has nothing to do with the fact that there&#39;s a fucking trench carved into my forehead. I&#39;ll post another angle so you can see how garbage it is.

Like if I zoom in on the picture I can see it, but it just looks like discoloration without zooming in and (assuming that the picture is accurately representative, which it may not be) I don’t think it would be visible unless someone was within like maybe 2 feet of you?

It&#39;s really hard to capture. The problem is more that it dips into my skin than the coloration I think it would be more visible if I took a whole face pic. Like it gets more noticable far away because you see the line from the indentation. But I&#39;m not outing myself on the internet

About your update to the original post- I’m not trying to antagonize you. I genuinely had to search for the scar when I looked at the picture. My vision is virtually perfect. Also, it’s not unheard of for the dysphoria-distortion phenomenon to extend to post surgical results, including scarring. Again though, I have only seen this picture. I’m not trying to assert that it necessarily looks the same irl.

Where is it? Seriously have you seen to botched surgeries people have had? Especially GRS. It take awhile for scars to heal. Use Mederma

You&#39;re joking, right? You ARE aware that multiple things can be bad and there are different degrees of bad results? I never said I was botched but to say this scar is invisible is just being deliberately obtuse.

They said to me there will be a scar. Yours does not make me go “OMG!” if you feel it’s that bad and you have the cash I’m sure you can find a plastic surgeon to do just a scar revision.

Can you read one of my previous posts before you spout more ignorance? This was already a revision of some very lackluster results after my first FFS. The was no scar at all after that surgery, it was completely invisible, so dealing with something this gross after a revision, with a supposedly better doctor, is infuriating. I&#39;m pretty sure that a 3rd surgery in that area will only make it worse. Trust me, it&#39;s VERY visible in person. Also, I DON&#39;T have the cash to spend. And I certainly don&#39;t have enough cash to blow on a &#39;dice roll&#39; scar revision. Laser and microneedle and maybe a tattoo are my only chance.

I honestly don’t understand why surgeons still do hairline incisions, they leave a extremely noticeable scar right on your forehead and the hairline always look blunt

Honestly, my first one was completely unnoticeable. I think the coronal incision can look worse. You&#39;ll have a line of baldness on your scalp forever.

I don’t even want to respond to this since you appear to be rude to everyone... are you using silicone sheets? Second this pic looks a lot less red than the previous one you posted. Scars will continue to fade for 1-2 years. Third your forehead is still large and you’d benefit from a hair transplant regardless of the scar. Fourth. Laser take multiple sessions before you start seeing a noticeable improvement, although it does not always work for everyone. Finally, medical tattooing camouflage is a thing...

I&#39;ve been using silicone gel and scar cream and shea butter for as long as I&#39;ve been allowed to use them according to my doctor&#39;s advice. I tried tape but it&#39;s almost impossible to get it to stay put on your hairline. I started around week 3 post op. I still use them every day.  The scar has seen no sunlight. I wear a headband over it constantly during the day. I DO think it looks better than it did 3 months ago, but when you consider that  literally twice the amount of time has passed now, it&#39;s not a very significant change so I&#39;m still pretty worried.
</p>
<p>
My forehead is adequately proportioned.. it&#39;s not high. It&#39;s actually low if you go by the proportions/ratios of my face and features. Ive never had hair loss. It looks bigger because of the angle that I needed to take the photo. I&#39;m perfectly happy with the size of it. Honestly it wasn&#39;t bad pre-op. I shouldn&#39;t have had it lowered and I&#39;m kicking myself about it now. I passed as cis before surgery and still do. I haven&#39;t been misgendered in over 10 years.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how you can even make that assessment when you can&#39;t see the rest of my face... You&#39;ll forgive me if I take anything else you have to say with a grain of salt. You&#39;re also wrong about scarring timelines. Scars mature at around one year. After that, they MIGHT continue to lighten but you&#39;re basically stuck at that point and no treatments will help much anymore.
<br>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m in a bit of a rush to treat... The clock is ticking and I&#39;m already halfway there.
</p>
<p>
I literally mentioned laser and tattoo camouflage in my last post. I&#39;m well aware of them. I also mentioned that in my consultation for transplants the tech told me specifically that they don&#39;t hold well in scar tissue because hair follicles need healthy blood vessels to live. The ones in scar tissue are often too damaged. It can take several rounds of treatment and even then, there&#39;s no guarantee. I don&#39;t have 5-10k to spend on maybe. In fact, I don&#39;t have it at all.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m only rude to people who are telling me they can&#39;t see it or that I&#39;m not botched enough or something to be upset about it. I&#39;m really sick of being gaslighted and hugboxed and basically given useless advice. Like I said, I&#39;m posting this mainly for other people to see that this is possible. I pretty much know all of my options. I&#39;m trying anything I can to look less mangled.
