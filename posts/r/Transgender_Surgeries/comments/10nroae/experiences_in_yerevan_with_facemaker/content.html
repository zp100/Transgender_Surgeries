So I&#39;m considering a few different FFS surgeons right now. All the archived posts from people who&#39;ve been to Facemaker are from when she was in Moscow still. I&#39;m curious if anyone has any experience with her in Yerevan.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the level of care set up there? Hotels? Shuttle service?
</p>
<p>
How is Armenia for queer and trans people?
</p>
<p>
I lived in a few post-communist countries in Europe pre-transition and didn&#39;t get the impression that people with any kind of variance are particularly accepted. Like I feel like presenting as a weird androgynous boy will even present with issues. This is making me lean more toward surgeons in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
Does anyone have any experiences or thoughts on this? Even if you&#39;ve just been to Armenia for non-trans things.

As an Armenian I would say no, cause it’s not very accepted there or in our culture sadly. I wouldn’t even go now after ffs and fully passing to be honest.

Why not after FFS and fully passing? Just the worry of if someone finds out or like just all the ways that women are discriminated against in general?

If you look at Sophie from mars’ Twitter it was hell for her in Armenia RE being trans but the surgery results were good

It was hard to find all of her tweets about it (I have no idea how to navigate Twitter), but yeah I saw some of those and that doesn&#39;t sound so awesome. Kind of confirms what I was worried about.
</p>
<p>
I mean I&#39;m currently still boymoding androgynously but that would make me pretty uncomfortable even just picking up on that. Plus going through the border I&#39;d be hella stressed.
