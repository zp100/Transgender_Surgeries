Expected length of maneuvers for genital electrolysis ‚Äì 4-hours.

</p>
<p>
Interested in following my journey?

</a>
is a link to my post about my first genital electrolysis experience. Thank you for following my story‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós
</p>
<p>
As stated in my previous post, my intent here is to debrief you concerning my experiences with my second genital electrolysis session at Dr. Christine McGinn‚Äôs Papillon Center located in New Hope, PA. This is to inform any who follow. I feel detail for the Community education is important. When you know what is ahead you can be better prepared and the journey is less scary . . .
</p>
<p>
Please, AMA . . .
</p>
<p>
<strong>
NOTE:
</strong>
<strong>
<em>
Wearing a mask at Papillon Center is mandatory! You are required to bring your own mask!
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We arrived at 4 Gazebo Pl. (New Hope, PA) just after 0830 hours. Appointment time 0900 hrs. I call the office to let staff know I have arrived for the appointment. Shortly before 0900, Ramona (the esthetician ) is standing beside the car to let me know it is okay to enter the building. I kiss my Better-half goodbye, (she is headed back to
<strong>
<em>
GAIA Guest House
</em>
</strong>
until checkout) put on my mask, gather up my wrap, purse, phone (still cannot bring in my iPad) and head inside. After signing in on the log sheet in the reception area, Ramona leads me back to the treatment room.
</p>
<p>
No additional paperwork this time. Ramona and I chat for a couple minutes then she points out hooks on the back of the door for hanging clothes, directs me to step behind the privacy screen and disrobe from the waste down and leaves the room. As during the last appointment, I perform the disrobing maneuvers, (however, much to my immediate dismay, I left the comfortable thick sox in the car!) assume the position on the treatment table and deploy the large paper drape to maintain at least a modicum of modesty.
</p>
<p>
There seems to be some confusion as to whom is going to administer the anesthetic injections, Dr. McGinn (what I&#39;m told first, Yay! I get to meet the famous Dr.) then, nope, it&#39;s Krystal, the equally famous PA. This goes back and forth for several minutes and apparently Dr. McGinn is tied up with a patient. (Monday&#39;s are her in-office days for post checks on surgery patients, consults, etc.) So it&#39;s Krystal.
</p>
<p>
Side note: Krystal administered the injections my last appointment. I very much like her style. No BS, lets get to it and get it done. She answers all questions and takes the time to clearly explain the procedure.
</p>
<p>
Krystal prepares the syringe and because of specific questions asked from my last post, I ask her questions asked of me:
</p>
<p>
Q: What is the compound of the anesthetic?
</p>
<p>
A: The compound is Lidocaine and 1% ephedrine. The ephedrine acts as a constrictor to keep the lidocaine where/in the area it is injected, which adds effective working time to the anesthetic.
</p>
<p>
Q: What type and size is the needle?
</p>
<p>
A: Needle: Spinal 25ga.
</p>
<p>
I felt that because I had been through this just 18-days ago and I was asking direct questions, Krystal was not being secretive about the syringe. I made a comment my first post about the size of the barrel of the syringe. I wasn‚Äôt kidding about the size of the syringe barrel. The freakin&#39; thing is HUGE!
</p>
<p>
Krystal adjusts the table completely flat stating it makes things easier for her to give the injections. Perhaps so, but I also personally think it is to prevent easily looking down and seeing that long-ass needle coming at me . . . As she begins, she asks me if the testicles are atrophied or removed by surgery. (I&#39;m pretty sure this has a bearing on how she administers the injections). I answer &#34;surgery&#34;. The only thing I feel are some minor tiny stings as the needle pierces the skin. FYI, I received a second set of injections in the perineum to allow Ramona to work down to the anus area this appointment.
</p>
<p>
The lidocaine kicks in pretty quickly and Ramona gets to work. Today the focus is on clearing around the lower base of the penile area and as much of the perineum down to the anus, as possible within the allotted time. I consider myself fortunate that the scrotum is not heavily &#34;forested&#34;. At about the 2.5 hour mark, I ask for another set of injections. Krystal comes back in and performs another round.
</p>
<p>
Other than good conversation with Ramona during the session, things are unremarkable.
<em>
Except:
</em>
With somewhat frequency, I experience uncontrollable muscle spasms after the treatment of the follicle. The area is numb, and I do not feel the application of the electricity. This is disconcerting and Ramona explains it is a side effect of the lidocaine. She has me assume a &#34;laying down yoga Tree Pose&#34; with my right leg so she can easily access the area down to and at the most forward part(?) of the anus.
</p>
<p>
Lessons Learned:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
As before, super hydrate with water before the appointment. It makes things easier to remove the hair from the follicle and really helps the treatment be more effective. Hydrate well after. It definitely helps with the healing.
</li>
<li>
Ramona recommended using witch hazel to clean the treated areas. I bought witch hazel wipes and Pain/Itch/Scar Neosporin for the aftercare. For me, this combination proved very effective in the healing. When I showed up for this appointment, with the exception of a slight soreness in the scrotal tissue, I was completely healed from the previous appointment. I have cleaned the areas and applied the Neo twice each day.
</li>
<li>
It is now 4-days post treatment. The pain is manageable with the Neosporin and Extra Strength Tylenol. By today, the discomfort is primarily soreness of the scrotal tissue and around the base of the penile tissue. The swelling has gone down quite a bit, although I still am unable to tuck tightly as usual.
</li>
<li>
I found Carefree Body Shape - Long pantiliners in the underwear to be very effective in putting a barrier between the clothing and the oozing associated with the treated areas. I placed the liner a good bit higher up in the front of the underwear and it works well.
</li>
<li>
I am not worried about feeling the lidocaine. YMMV, but for me, all the stories I previously read in this sub about how bad it hurts did not come true in my case.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Update: 6/7/20 - 6-days post treatment.
</em>
</strong>
This evening as I‚Äôm cleaning the treated areas with the witch hazel wipes I notice the scabbing coming off on the wipes. There remains noticeable scabbing around the penile base and inline on the right side of the perineum down to the anus. Swelling is now only slight and minor pain (.5 - 1 on the 10 scale) in the scrotal area. The Tylenol is more than adequate to address the discomfort.
</p>
<p>
AMA. I wish you Peace and Kindness.

I‚Äôd reccomended going back to your previous posts and editing them to add a link to the next. You‚Äôve only got links no way at the moment and it would be helpful for anyone who finds your older posts first.

Ephedrine does something like that. It‚Äôs a very powerful stimulant.

Thank you for the advice. I‚Äôll go back and add the appropriate links. Update: 6/6/2020 I went back and went nuts adding links forward and back connecting my journey. You may have created a monster‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós

Session to session the thing to document the most would be something like:
</p>
<p>
[total time] - [what area was worked on] [if it was cleared or not]
</p>
<p>
Then at the end you can put all of the summaries together and create a very clear timeline of how long it took to get the first clearing, if/when the sessions start getting shorter to clear the full area.  So today would be something like?
</p>
<p>
6-2-20 - 3.5h - lower base of the penile area and as much of the perineum down to the anus - Not finished clearing

Thank you‚ù£Ô∏èI‚Äôve worried about being repetitious. So far there have been differences in the experience and I want to tell the story without coming across like a broken record.

Thanks for sharing this update! I was wondering if you think it would be possible to do a 2 hour drive home after getting electrolysis, or if it would be too painful/irritating on the skin? I want to go to her once I get my insurance lined up and to save money/time would like to do day trips from Brooklyn rather than stay overnight

I have to admit I had a pretty good sting going on immediately after the appointment. I took two extra strength Tylenol and had planned ahead by not wearing tight fitting underwear. In the interest of full disclosure, it simply was not possible to do the usual tight tuck after the appointment.
</p>
<p>
As luck would have it, there was a major crash on the highway home and added 2.5 hours to a normally 4.5 hour drive. Ymmv, but for me, the Tylenol managed to take a lot of the sting out during the ride home. In retrospect, I‚Äôm going to bring the pain/itch/scar Neosporin to my next appointment and apply before I leave the Center.
</p>
<p>
You mentioned getting your insurance lined up. Papillon Center helped by way of me paying a $45 administrative fee and Lori worked with my insurance to receive authorization for the service. Hands down, it was money well spent. Papillon Center sent me insurance ready receipts I‚Äôve submitted for reimbursement. ü§ós

Amazing, thank you! Did you have to wait long to get an initial appointment there?

The timeline: January 6/7, 2020 - completed and sent Papillon Center the intake forms.
</p>
<p>
March 17, 2020 - Papillon Center received the insurance authorization for the electrolysis and Lori sets up 3 appointments beginning in April, one month apart.
</p>
<p>
March 27, 2020 - COVID-19 hits, my April appointment is cancelled.
</p>
<p>
Early May, 2020 - Papillon Center calls me and offers me a makeup appointment for the one cancelled in April. They kept my previously scheduled May appointment so I had two that month, 18-days apart. They worked with me and scheduled an additional appointment in August.
</p>
<p>
I cannot say enough good about Dr. McGinn‚Äôs team and how they have helped me. I have my next electrolysis appointment later this month and I‚Äôm combining it with a BA and TS consult with Dr. McGinn. ü§ós
