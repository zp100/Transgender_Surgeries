Very very bruised still and unfortunately bowl was not working this morning so had to dilate with it full. Catheter out (hurray) Weeing not an issue just feels strange and scans show bladder is emptying fully. Had 2 scans, need one more for waterworks all clear. Can&#39;t believe how much depth miss Rashid has gotten from my wee donor! Amazing, I got past the last dot before deciding that was plenty. First dilation was smooth enough, but quite a bit of pain afterwards which disappeared after emptying bladder, then returned when I douched. I think this was me creating an air lock which put pressure on pelvic floor, this was actually very painful, and made me very unstable in the shower. I sat on the throne again before attempting to wash myself first, douche 2nd. This time I introduced the douche maybe a couple inches and expelled before refilling and going for 4&#34; on second douche. This was much much more effective/less painful. After that, I simply zonked out really knackered, with every muscle hurting. Only bit that did not hurt was my new bits. I also felt sick. this passed in an hour or so and dilation #2 is up next. Not sure whether I will try the blue, let&#39;s see how it goes.

I think it will look pretty good once the swelling has gone down, but it&#39;s going to take a long time.

Congratulations!
</p>

Note on the douching. I really hurt me as I was super tight down there and could only manage small orange for the first few months. When I squeezed the douche it would create a lot of pressure in there and it wouldn&#39;t come out straight away as the douche tube was blocking the way. Eventually I managed to figure out if I angled it slightly to one side the water would come out more easily and not hurt as much. Hope this helps.

Looking really, really good x

That bruising looks painful. (Had a bruised bottom once from an office chair moving away as I sat down and my bum hit the base of the chair and was bloody bruised for a week and it hurt like hell to the touch and sitting down. Knackered my computer desk, I loved that desk couldn&#39;t get a replacement but I digress.)
