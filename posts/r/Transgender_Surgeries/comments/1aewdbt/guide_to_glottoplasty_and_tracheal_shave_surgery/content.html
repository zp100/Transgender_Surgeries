This guide covers my experience of getting a glottoplasty (Wendler with Laser Assisted Voice Adjustment aka LAVA) and tracheal shave simultaneously. I had this surgery done with Mr Al Yaghchi in London yesterday (29th January)
</p>
<p>
I compiled this guide based on my previous combing of reddit posts, interviewing friends who have had the procedure done, looking up doctor’s websites, looking up voice hydration advice from singers, and probably a few other places I’ve forgotten to mention.
</p>
<p>
Mr Al Yaghchi’s website:
<a href="https://lvsclinic.com/">https://lvsclinic.com/
</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Research
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
My normal conversational voice was in the androgynous range at around 150ish HZ. I could talk at around 200-230 HZ but I found it so difficult to maintain this while having conversations. I talk far more than the average person in the average day. I was fortunate that my partner has had a glottoplasty, in fact I accompanied her to get it done. So I had some first hand experience which prompted me to pursue this surgery.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend looking at Youtube for examples of glottoplasty and tracheal shave. There’s nothing particularly comprehensive that I could find but I will perhaps make a video when I find my voice in a few months time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The price
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
There are 4 categories of cost that add up to the price of the surgery. You’ll also have to consider travel cost for 4 trips to One Welbeck (that’s the name of the hospital) in London.
</p>
<p>
Consultation- I believe the initial consultation was £510 including the camera fee and the two follow-ups will cost just £160 each as they are paid for with the initial fee except for the camera fee.
</p>
<p>
Mr Al Yaghchi’s surgical fee- circa £2,150
</p>
<p>
Hospital fee- circa £4,200
</p>
<p>
Anaesthetist fee- circa £825
</p>
<p>
Prices will obviously change but at the time of writing the total cost adds up to around £7,500 (GBP)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Consultation
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
You’ll need to travel to the clinic for a consultation before you are allowed to book a surgery appointment. The purpose of the consultation is to learn a bit about you but also to make sure there are no issues which could affect the surgery such as polyps. You’ll be given a questionnaire to fill in and then eventually taken through to see the surgeon and they’ll ask you a few questions (just the usual sort of trans health things). Now the fun bit…. You’ll have a camera put up one of your nostrils and you’ll get to see what your vocal cords look like. It’s not the most comfortable experience and I coughed a bit afterwards but it doesn’t take long and it really doesn’t have to travel far into your nose to get to where it needs to be. You’ll just be asked to say a few sentences and then it’s pretty much over. It sucks much less than you’d expect but it’s definitely not my favourite experience.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Questions you may think of while waiting for the surgery day
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
Make a list of any questions you might have so that you can ask the surgical team or the nurses on the day of surgery. You can also email Mr Al Yaghchi’s secretary/assistant and in my experience they are very helpful. I’m sure quite a few questions will pop into your head and it’s normal to want to ask them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Preparing for surgery day
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I started taking anti-histamines and perfectil (skin/nails vitamins). I also take multivitamins and cod liver oil normally. I’d recommend all these things just to maximise the speed and ease of your recovery.
</p>
<p>
If you haven’t got a speech therapist I would recommend getting yourself one. I self-taught myself voice training through Youtube and some apps but having a vocal therapist to help you is worth it. I did get a compliment on how well I completed the exercises and my general voice technique.
</p>
<p>
You’ll want to practice methods to avoid coughing, clearing your throat and sneezing. I won’t cover these here except to say that just slowing down, in my experience at least, can help prevent the onset of coughing or sneezing. You can also rub the roof of your mouth to help prevent a sneeze. Just start swallowing to clear your throat and after a couple of weeks it will feel natural.
</p>
<p>
I bought Robitussin (dextromethorphan) and guaifenesin. I checked with the nurses after the surgery that these were ok to take while recovering. I was advised not to take the dextromethorphan unless I really needed to and that the guaifenesin was ok to just take if I wanted to. I also brought some heartburn medicine along with me just in case. I never needed to take any of these medicines in the first 24 hours but they may be useful later in recovery.
</p>
<p>
I was really afraid of getting ill and having to postpone the surgery so I shielded as much as I practically could. I’d wear a mask whenever I was out and my partner also wore a mask and put off some social get-togethers to prevent her getting ill and passing it on to me. I missed quite a few things I wanted to go to but I’m glad I did it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Thinks to take
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I bought a nebuliser to hydrate my throat. Having tried it out when it arrived I opted not to take it as it was making me cough. For this reason I would say that steamers win hands down over nebulisers.
</p>
<p>
BRING WATER!!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. Take enough water to get you home. I brought a six pack of 500ml water bottles as well as two 325ml bottles of water and we still needed to buy another three 500ml bottles of water on the train journey back (to Scotland so it was a rather long journey). YOU WILL NEED PLENTY OF WATER! Do I make myself clear? Good.
</p>
<p>
I am a fussy eater and hater of sandwiches so, not knowing what the post-surgery meal would be in advance and suspecting it to be on the sandwichy side, I bought a croissant at a deli in Euston Station to take with me and have after surgery. I can’t recall what the menu they brought when I woke up contained but I’m fairly sure it was sandwiches and a few other things I wouldn’t have eaten. I did elect to get some apple juice though and sipping a little of a time between having larger amounts of water was refreshing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The day of surgery
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
You cannot eat food for at least 6 hours before the surgery. You must not drink water for at least 2 hours before the surgery. The clinic will give you guidance on this which may in future change but that’s the information I was given.
</p>
<p>
I ate a big meal the night before (my primary partner is a chef and we decided to try making currywurst together of all things) and had a hot pizza roll as my bedtime snack at 1am. I stopped drinking at 8.30am (my surgery check-in was 10.30am and the surgery itself was scheduled for 11.30am. I was feeling a bit thirsty
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Travelling to the clinic
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I took the Caledonian Sleeper train down to London from Stirling the night before my surgery. Make sure if you do this you get a bed and not a seat, you will want to get as much sleep as you can. We opted for the club bedroom with bunk beds, this gave us access to the lounge in the morning which was very handy to just ground ourselves. There’s also a shower in the lounge as well as some complimentary drinks and biscuits (just plain water for you though!).
</p>
<p>
A taxi from Euston to the clinic was £10 (29/01/2024)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Check-in
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
You’ll get a time to arrive at the hospital by. We were half an hour early but this was fine and there’s plenty of comfortable seating. My partner got a free coffee from one of the many hot drinks machines. They’ll probably send you up to level 4 where you’ll check in with reception there and then when they’re ready for you to go to the surgical floor they’ll escort you there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-surgery
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I was taken to a room and the procedure was explained to me. I don’t remember a huge amount about this part but it was just a quick stop while they finished getting my recovery room ready. I think this is where the anaesthetist explained the procedure with the anaesthetic to me. I was then guided through and given a bunch of stuff to put on after the nurse left the room. This comprised of two gowns (one that opened at the back and one that opened at the front- you put the one with the opening at the back on first), disposable underwear, compression stockings, and grippy socks.
</p>
<p>
They’ll also give you the nurse-call button. I ended up using this several times and they were very happy to help so don’t be afraid to use it.
</p>
<p>
You will want to setup your bedside table BEFORE surgery. I would recommend putting out:
</p>
<p>
A notepad (since you won’t be allowed to talk)
</p>
<p>
A pen (I used a felt one so it would be easier to read)
</p>
<p>
Water (preferably from something without a sports cap- I got drenched trying to drink after just coming to!)
</p>
<p>
Food (if you bring your own as I did)
</p>
<p>
Your partner can come to your bedroom with you and wait for you there if they’d like (I assume it’s just one person they would allow to accompany you in there).
</p>
<p>
Once you’re dressed, you will be given forms to check and sign. I must admit I was a little shakey and when it came to the signature I even began entering the first few letters of my deadname. I quickly stopped myself and wrote in the correct name but I just wanted to show that the process can take a heavy mental toll on you and it’s ok to be a bit overwhelmed. I’m usually very calm-headed and absolutely on top of things, and it does take a lot to overwhelm me but this did and that’s ok. Just breathe and you will get through it too.
</p>
<p>
Mr Al Yaghchi came to check on me. It was just a quick in and out visit, and then he went to prepare for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Thoughts before the surgery
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
This bit deserves its own section.
</p>
<p>
I had so many doubts racing through my mind when I got to the clinic. I can only describe it as having an imaginary devil on your shoulder whispering into your ear. I thought about if I was really trans (having transitioned several years ago), I worried that something would go wrong, I worried that I would alienate myself from other trans people who haven’t gotten these sorts of procedures and whether any friends I would make after the surgery would only like me because I assimilated more into the role of an average woman (I am after all a proudly queer presenting person), I worried about lots of other tiny things too.
</p>
<p>
When I came around I had absolutely no regrets and I just felt this intense happiness that I had made it through the surgery. When I saw my neck I couldn’t help smiling. I’m not ashamed that I had those doubts and if it’s something you go through as well then just know that you’re not alone and it’s perfectly okay. It’s a huge thing to go through.
</p>
<p>
Also, I’m getting FFS in a few months and I’m actually really glad I have this experience of a smaller surgery as in some ways it was a little scary and I can only imagine a surgery that’s several times longer and in another country will be harder to get through. I feel a lot more prepared for FFS now and I know I will be more comfortable with myself in the months coming up to it too which itself will make things easier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The procedure
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I was walked into the operating theatre. All the medical team said hello and it was a lovely atmosphere. It was very cold though- like being in the fridge aisle at a supermarket. I had to remove my top gown and the back of the bottom gown was untied. I was prompted to lie-down on the operating bed (which was quite like an ordinary gurney-type bed) with my knees over a cushion, my feet in a sort of gel-mould comfort pillow, and with my head on a fairly regular pillow. I get the shakes from cold really easily so I was shaking like a leaf even in my gown and with them covering my legs and torso with the top gown that I removed.
</p>
<p>
The nurses were chatty and were asking me about my life as they expertly carried out their duties. I was fitted with a blood pressure monitor on my arm, a pulse monitor on a finger, and then the anaesthetist fitted a cannula to the back of my hand. There was a little bit of a sharp scratch from that but once it was in it caused me no trouble. They warn you the anaesthetic, which is fed in via the cannula, will feel a bit cold travelling up your arm. That was true for me but it wasn’t particularly uncomfortable and the experience was brief. I don’t recall even getting the feeling of nodding off, I just went out like a light and it seemed like the next moment I was waking up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Waking up
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I woke up with a nebuliser mask on and I found it difficult to breathe without coughing. I took the mask off several times and also held it a bit away from my face. I had heard this was very normal and so I wasn’t worried. As I’ve covered earlier as well, I am not a fan of nebulisers. I coughed maybe five or six times but they were quite light coughs and these are normal.
</p>
<p>
Waking up itself was very quick and wasn’t like when you get up in the morning normally and slowly come around. That was a bit of a strange experience I suppose; feeling very awake and not being able to discern the moment you actually started coming round. It’s also a little strange to look down and realise you’re on a fabric stretcher that they will have used to transfer you back onto your bed.
</p>
<p>
As I’ve mentioned previously, they will bring you food after you wake up but you can bring your own.
</p>
<p>
On a scale of 1-10 my pain was at highest a 2. It was most noticeable when swallowing (I took a good few minutes to eat my croissant).
</p>
<p>
I vaguely remember Mr Al Yaghchi come in briefly to check I was doing well, it must have been just after I woke up. Following this, I saw only the nurse team.
</p>
<p>
My advice for the hour or two after the surgery is to just enjoy being looked after. It was genuinely really nice to wake up and take my time. Don’t be in a rush, just enjoy sitting up in bed. Maybe it’s the meds they give you during the surgery but I did feel this sort of heavenly euphoria when I came to and it lapped over me like waves softly coming up a beach. I didn’t even look at the results on my neck for about half an hour. I did have about 20-30 people to message when I woke up but I took my time with that too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Leaving the clinic
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
The clinic will give you a prescription. There is a pharmacy just on the other side of the road where you can get your meds. It took around 15 mins from handing over the prescription papers to getting the meds.
</p>
<p>
If you go back home via train, I would recommend you get a taxi to the train station. You may still be a bit unsteady and not thinking at 100% capacity and it’s not a huge amount more than getting the tube or a bus. When I went with my partner for her procedure around a year and a half ago, her mother drove her in and there was parking in the streets nearby.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Getting home
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
I would recommend getting some grapes for your travels. Melon can be a bit hard and fibrous so it is harder to swallow and can make you cough if you’re not very careful. Apple slices are good but not particularly juicy.
</p>
<p>
Swallowing and moving my neck definitely got more painful as the day progressed. I had a 5 hour train journey and I found because it hurt to move my head all the way back into the seat it ended up hurting my back, shoulders and the back of my head quite a bit from the tension. Once I got back home though I was able to lie on the couch and this helped a lot.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sleeping
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
There are no particular rules for sleeping arrangements. I asked the nurses if I should sleep upright and they said it wasn’t necessary. I tried sleeping on a wedge pillow just because I thought it might be better but I chucked it out of the bed fairly quickly as it was preventing me drifting off. I got dihydrocodeine tablets in the prescription and these did help me nod off fairly quickly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 2
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
The neck is more visibly bruised. Swallowing still sucks. I feel a little forgetful so I decided to write down what meds I take as I take them so I don’t accidentally have more than I think I’ve taken. The back of my neck and shoulders are hurting a lot because of the tension caused by not being able to move my neck freely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovering
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
The #1 most important thing for you to do is to harness the power of steam! Ever noticed how your breathing and voice just feel a bit less restricted after a hot bath? That’s because the steam can reach your vocal cords directly. Drinking water will hydrate them but indirectly so steam is a great addition to staying hydrated which is also very important. I bought a face steamer unit but I found it’s not nearly as effective as a bowl of water straight from the kettle and a towel covering your head. You’ll get told to do this by the clinic but I want to emphasise that it does noticeably help you prevent coughing so definitely do it. If you can’t prevent a cough, do remember that a small cough is better than a violent one so try to keep them small. Clearing the air from your lungs or just standing still can help if you feel a cough coming on.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you drink lots of water. Keep yourself hydrated. Keep a bottle of water on you at all times; relaxing on the couch, in bed, even when you go to the toilet. If you need to cough or clear your throat water can be invaluable in preventing that happening. You could also strategically place bottles of water around your home/workplace.
</p>
<p>
If you have a partner or friend looking after you, you’re going to do a lot of writing down so get a writing pad and some pens. You can use Google Translate to speak the words you write.
</p>
<p>
I would avoid eating foods with lots of dairy. It can cause a bit of a phlegm build up and give your throat extra work. I love milkshakes, ice cream, and all that but it’s worth taking a break from them for a couple of weeks to give your voice the best chance.
</p>
<p>
Juicy fruit like grapes would be good to stock up on. For me, I try to avoid anything that might be hard to swallow or that might bring on coughing. Things like the seeds in strawberries or tougher fruit can be harder (not necessarily hard) to eat than grapes so I guess I’m going to give the seedless ones the number one spot in my book. You’ll want to avoid orange juice because it can dry out the vocal cords because of its acidity and likelihood of acid reflux.
</p>
<p>
Swallowing pills may suck. Do them one at a time at first to see how easily they go down.
</p>
<p>
This guide is about my particular experience with a particular clinic and a particular surgeon. However, I hope it is also useful for those getting the same surgery elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I would just like to finalise by saying that you will get through this. It might seem a bit scary but you’re in really good hands and all you need to do is look after yourself while you’re recovering. Planning ahead will help a lot and I hope I’ve given some comprehensive guidance above. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. I want this guide to be as comprehensive and helpful as possible so all feedback will be gratefully received.

Thank you so much for this post. It&#39;s really helping me prepare for surgery in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I really like / need to be fully informed before i go through with anything like this and you are helping me a lot.
</p>
<p>
Hope your recovery is going amazing and would love to hear your voice ❤️

I’m very glad. I should probably update it soon, I’ve just been recovering from FFS and I’ve been a bit tired.

Youre very welcome. I&#39;m currently having my first steam of the day. Really important to do it, makes it so much easier to avoid coughing

I look forward to it. I had a voice feminization surgery but not so great results so looking into doctors for revision. Maybe yours ?

Mine is going well. I&#39;m investing in voice training to get the most from it. My current voice hasn&#39;t changed that much because I did speak with a well trained voice albeit androgynous. My effortless normal is nearly the same as my voice i put some effort into. I can no longer go down to male frequencies without it sounding silly and when I put effort in, I can speak above the average female range. I just need to find my voice now I don&#39;t need to worry about there being so much bass on tap.

Love that you can’t reach those lower parts also it requires less effort from you to speak your normal voice. I hope I can get that from revision. Good luck on the journey to finding your voice.
