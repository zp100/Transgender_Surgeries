I want everyone to see the healing progress because I went through a lot of stress post op thinking I was going to have really bad scars that I would be botched around the 2 week mark. I was wrong and I want people to see how our bodies heal drastically after 2 months. I have no more pain and no open wounds or granulation tissue. I have 6 inches of depth and using the orange dilator as well. Orgasms are amazing and I‚Äôve already had 2 of them!

First, thank you for sharing. It takes
<strong>
<em>
courage
</em>
</strong>
to put yourself out there with pictures.  You are giving back to our community, bigtime, and I hope people outside our Sisterhood are respectful in their comments.
</p>
<p>
Second, The clarity of the photos is stunning, which leads to the question, when did you begin dilating? From what you posted showing all the swollen tissue, did you have difficulty dilating? What is your dilating regimen, 4-times per day, 3-times? Inquiring minds (mine) would like to know . . .

I‚Äôm so sorry i did not see this comment earlier. I started dilating five days after surgery when the packing came out. I haven‚Äôt had any pain dilating, but i have had discomfort when I sized up to the orange one and some bleeding. That‚Äôs all went away. I started dilating 4 times a day for the first 6 weeks and now i dilate 3 times a day.

Thank you. Your regimen mirrors what I‚Äôve been instructed will be required of me after my vaginoplasty at NYU. As to the discomfort you felt when sizing up to the orange dilator, would you describe it as local to the introitus and surrounding muscle/tissue (as in being stretched when sizing up) or was it internal?

I would describe it as more pressure and it was pretty tight. I found that if I breathe in to a count of 3 through my nose and hold for a count of five, and exhale for a count of 6-8 then that relaxes my pelvic floor. I always push the dilator in on the exhale. I don‚Äôt really have to do that anymore though.

Thank you so much for this. Going from terrifying post op pictures to a beautiful perfect result is so reassuring. And I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be even more so once I go through with it

Congrats! It looks amazing! Although, I&#39;m nervous about going this myself so I have to ask. Is that some kind of infection in a few of the pics? Or is it just the healing process? Sorry if that&#39;s rude. I&#39;m just nervous

It‚Äôs fibrinous exudate, it‚Äôs not an infection. Just a part of the healing process.

I wanted to share those photos because I was in a very dark space mentally when I was going through the 3 week mark. I hadn‚Äôt really seen any photos of what the natural healing process really was like. It‚Äôs very worth it.

Congratulations!  It looks so good!
</p>
<p>
I am very excited to get GRS, but I must admit that immediately post-op photos always make me a bit squeamish.  It just looks so messy...like scrambled eggs.  I hope you don&#39;t mind my asking, what exactly is the yellow-ish white stuff?  Is it puss?  Discharge?  Discoloration?

Omg I can already tell the very finished product is going to look really good.

Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but it looks like Jun put your canal between your labia minora rather than under it which is incredibly refreshing to see. A lot of American surgeons drop the ball on getting the anatomy correct but this looks like it has all the structures in the right place.

Thanks for posting the recovery photos, like you said lots of people get super worried during recovery that something is messed up/it won&#39;t look OK after their body heals up! When I got top surgery, I was super worried my nipples were going to like, reject or something, so seeing others post here was very helpful. Congrats, and wishing you a speedy rest of the healing process!

Thank you for sharing! Incredible results, exactly why I&#39;m hoping for PPT also. Your clitoral hood/area looks so good an natural, may I ask if you were circumcised or not? (because poor outcome here is probably my main fear)

Thank you for posting! It is hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel while healing. I certainly had regrets when I had ffs and thought I was disfigured.
</p>
<p>
I have a consult with Dr. Jun next month!

You look great!

If you don&#39;t mind me asking, in the most recent photos your skin around your vagina is still raised up. Is that swelling or intended to be mons pubis?

Oh wait I totally misunderstood your question! The skin around my vagina is not swollen. The line going down my outer labia is a surgical scar. Only visible when I spread my labia. It is very fine so when I spread my labia majora sometimes it looks like that! I hope that‚Äôs answers your question. The mons pubis is above the clitorus.

Looks amazing, I am currently scheduled for a consult with Dr. Jun, but not until January 2023. I have a lot of anxiety about surgery, but I know in the end it will be worth it. If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how would you rate the pain 1-10, and how soon were you able to really be mobile again (on your own), to like go to the store, do housework, lift smallish things, or exercise?

I think around 8 weeks is when I was feeling pretty mobile and able to do most activities. Sitting is still not 100% normal. I would say 70 percent of the time I can sit just fine and then I will have to go get my donut pillow or reposition.

They deleted their comment because it was walking the line of disrespect. And also healing takes a year so let‚Äôs not judge results tile then. They were being very judgmental and i am always going to stick up for someone who might be insecure about their healing because I went through the same thing

Let‚Äôs also not refer to someone‚Äôs clit (which it wasn‚Äôt her clit, it was swollen inner labia, and a penis) this thread is for support and resources. And using penis to describe someone‚Äôs freshly new vagina which can take a year to heal really triggers some second hand dysphoria for me. Even if what you said was the truth, keep those thoughts to yourself because beauty comes with time. As shown in my collage. I have even more up to date photos where my vagina has evolved even further and it just keeps getting prettier and prettier. I love my vagina, and Dr Jun is the most trust worthy surgeon I‚Äôve ever seen or researched. And this is over a decade of research that I have done. He‚Äôs the right pick for me, and in my humble opinion the best pick. He works with what he has available, and he gives everyone their own unique experience because that‚Äôs how vaginas are. They are all different and unique. That‚Äôs what makes them beautiful. Definitely never seen a botched job by Dr. Jun, and since he takes 7-8 hours to perform this surgery compared to the normal 1-3 hour surgeries most other perform that should tell you something right there. He takes his time and he make a work of art per say. And let‚Äôs be kinder to these doctors who are probably overbooked and can‚Äôt take a day off because they know these surgeries are important to us and they follow through. They don‚Äôt get sick days, because this job is rough and probably very exhausting.

yeah i noticed now that it might be a bad idea to mention it here, but who are you talking about? saying it was her labia
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
i do agree that this wasn&#39;t the palce for it. but lying to ourselves and keeping it to ourselves is horrible, it was this community that raised my expectations then made me really sad when i saw reality. and we can&#39;t see improvement if we pretend everything about SRS is perfect!
</p>
<p>
Sorry for mentioning it here tho

btw how much did the surgery cost? I&#39;m from canada but I wanna go with him
