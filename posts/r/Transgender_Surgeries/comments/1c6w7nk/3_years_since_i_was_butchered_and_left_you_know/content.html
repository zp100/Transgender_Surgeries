The person needs to lose their licence, the fact they post fake reviews should make her lose her licence itself.
</p>
<p>
Its disgusting how they are allowed to get away with this.

As I said earlier a couple of years back there are hardly any surgeons taking up PPV or colon surgeries and now everyone is offering them.. Reason being the cost of such major surgeries are high.. And these blotchers main specialty will not be GCS / SRS, they will just offer it as they are board certified plastic surgeon and as this Surgery comes with big package $$$$ .. They also offer insurance and they will not have any advance booking option, they will always be available to take up your surgery. People just make a forum or list and start black listing THEM ASAP before another person goes through the same ordeal.

Is there not specialist licensing that surgeons need to perform this kind of surgery? Lumping it under &#34;plastic surgery&#34; feels very misguided. Does WPATH certify people? A standards/ regulatory body could help us. If we only go with WPATH certified then we can have some confidence

.In WPATH site there should be a forum available where all can formally raise a complaint and as she marci herself has some cases attributed to her so there should be a panel of senior doctors associated with WPATH who should review such complaints and if found legit should take appropriate action against such doctors... And WE NEED THIS ASAP
</p>
<p>
Any board certified plastic surgeon should not immediately take up GCS/SRS surgeries, there should be a Prerequisite guidelines laid out for them to meet the criteria , such as a trainee should be under a senior GCS surgeon for said time and perform X amount of such surgeries under their guidance, leadership and then get nod from senior surgeon and WPATH to take up such surgeries.

I posted about this some time ago but deleted it out of fear . I heard she was suing people or attempting to. However I read a recent post by a girl that was horrific. And I thought to myself maybe I should share my story again it been awhile

She should lose her license to practice medicine permanently, because of her negligence in always telling the patient that every  complication outcome is normal and her negligence in failing to act in a timely manner.. The trauma she has caused people, the disfiguring and breaking the hypocratic oath of &#34;doing no harm.&#34; Why would she continue to practice knowing her high rate of complications, where is her compassion and empathy for her patients, shame on you Dr. Rumer.

Tbh doctors usually only lose their license in one state, and can move to another to continue practice. It&#39;s disgusting.

John Oliver did an amazing breakdown! There was a doctor that was basically a convicted felon and out on bail? or something and literally a patient was in their waiting room. I hope the interviewers informed the could-be patient as they left.

Probably so but you need to get other people involved so it&#39;s obviously a whole host of people who&#39;s lives have been negativing changed because of this surgeon and file a lawsuit  before she retires .

This might sound drastic but for everything you went through the surgeon should not only lose their license and provide adequate compensation but should actually be sent to jail.

So   The first year was the worse. It gradually got alittle better with constant care and emergency room visits. I’m ot were I wanna be . But I’m also not where I was . Considering. All that happened during the healing process . My aesthetic in opinion didn’t turn out bad considering .  One thing I learned is to live life . I can’t just sit home and cry and think that everything will be ok . I have to do like any other human and keep a strong mind frame to get things fixed . I have traveled I have been to the beach danced . I have sex orally been fingered because a penis can’t fit in there anymore . Anal  has been my go to.   I know I need a revision. I know this sinus track need to be fixed . . Dealing with insurance and trying to find a doctor I can trust to  actually  resolve the issues and not create more is my problem . Honestly the sinus track is what at the moment worries me the most . As I stated I thought it was healed . I had an amazing year  from April 2023 until last Monday . Life was good no infection .  No abscess. I really felt I got to enjoy myself and my body .  Then boom an abscess appeared . Heartbreaking . But if we don’t advocate for our self  who will ? . I have become my own personal nurse .  I have learned so much dealing with this . Example how we as trans woman especially those with penile  inversion . When we get vaginal swabs we should ask  for both aerobic and anaerobic testing . And always ask what the species of bacteria is . Research and make sure the medicine they give you is appropriate.   If you know something is wrong keep pressing no matter how many emergency room visits you need . Don’t be scared . Your health is more important.

Wow, it&#39;s really admiring to see someone with this kind of attitude (that I wish I had) after all you&#39;ve been through. You seem like a cool person. I wish you all the good things in life &lt;3.

And too bad a class action suit cannot be filed  by her patients against her for many things from negligence to pain and suffering to at least getting any money you paid her back. Thanking you for telling your story so hopefully others can avoid her like the plaque.

Keep trying, the case will be stronger the more number of people you have and look at the trans men population as well, because she has done similar things to them. The attorney doesn&#39;t have to be located in Philly, maybe reach out to the Transgender law center in California and see if they have any suggestions of a law firm to take the case. They just need to be licensed to practiced law in the state of Pennsylvania to file a lawsuit.

Thank you for sharing your story and helping to spread the word of this awful woman who has been preying on trans people for years.

I&#39;m sorry you had just an awful experience. Nobody deserves that. I hope you&#39;ve been able to find some comfort in the end, one way or another.

Please tell me you went to a malpractice lawyer to sue the heck out of her.  The SOL for medical malpractice is 2 years in PA.  You can get a lot of money back not only for the surgery but also for pain and suffering and the cost of ongoing care.  That can be in the millions!  At the very least, please file a complaint against her license so that she can at least answer and have some consequences.  This person shouldn’t be practicing medicine.  I wish I had seen ur post beforehand.  My heart goes to you.  Is there any chance you could get a revision?

While my experience was not the same as yours, I feel your pain. My troubles started at 2 weeks out.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really struggling now with my mental health. I feel ashamed I chose her to be my surgeon in the first place (I know this is completely irrational but it lingers). I wish you luck and hope that we all get the justice we deserve.

You chose to make a healthy move in your life and she chose a quick and easy act. Your life isnt an act and over time tour experience will involve less and less of her. I hope you are feeling ok and are finding strength. Many positive thoughts to the spaghetti monster for you. Time heals, surgeons are just checkpoints.

I believe many have reporter her . But it usually falls on death ears because nothing has happened . She wil either say it’s the patients fault . Or say the patient sign a agreement acknowledging that complications could happen
