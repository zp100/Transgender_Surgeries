This was released by the American College of Surgeons today
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Each hospital, health system, and surgeon should thoughtfully review all scheduled elective procedures with a plan to minimize, postpone, or cancel electively scheduled operations, endoscopies, or other invasive procedures until we have passed the predicted inflection point in the exposure graph and can be confident that our health care infrastructure can support a potentially rapid and overwhelming uptick in critical patient care needs.

This is the right thing to do as much as I hate admitting it. We need to completely refocus our awful (US) health care system on this virus. Any nonessential (by which I mean essential to sustaining life) healthcare resources need to be redirected immediately.
</p>
<p>
But it does suck. Just like closing schools, shutting down sports, events etc. sucks. We can both admit that it sucks AND admit that we have to do it.

Yes, but people who need to be in intensive care take priority for the time being. it&#39;s just how it is, the virus is a huge strain on the health care systems of their respective countries.

No, sorry, you&#39;re wrong about this one. I&#39;m affected too, as I had an upcoming surgery. This pandemic absolutely takes priority.

Don&#39;t bother. Trans people with this mindset are narcissistic. If someone is that suicidal, they need to be admitted into a psych hospital or have intensive therapy. Yes, surgeries are important, but considering a vast majority of trans people are living and thriving without surgery (not because they don&#39;t want it), they&#39;ll be okay.

Just out of genuine curiousity, what is this magical intensive therapy that will cure body dysphoria?
</p>
<p>
Also calling clearly suicidal people narcissistic and then going on to show exactly 0 empathy towards them kind of comes across as projecting.

It&#39;s not magical but if you&#39;re actively suicidal, you should seek therapy. The healing process is not easy and even if you get surgery, if the hospital doesn&#39;t allow visitors (which is what my facility has started), that can have an effect on your psychological health while healing also. I don&#39;t know why you all are just responding to me when many people in the thread said the same thing. It sucks, but that&#39;s life. If you can&#39;t cope with that, then life will be hard for you.

I don&#39;t know, I just came across as your comment first and that&#39;s why I replied. I just find it really heartbreaking to see almost everyone dismiss someone clearly in a terrible situation, and saying that in the name of caring for everyone else they should just accept getting pushed down the hole and possibly being driven to suicide.
</p>
<p>
And we both know that no psych ward is going to help this.

I&#39;m not trying to be callous but again, this is life. It sucks but it happens. Doctors are worried about overflowing ERs and hospitals near capacity. If your surgery isn&#39;t life and death, they likely will cancel. That&#39;s just how it is. I work in a hospital and it&#39;s just a lot of stuff happening right now. From the outside, it can seem unfair. Maybe I&#39;m more level headed because surgery isn&#39;t ever happening for me.

Therapy doesn’t help past a certain point. That’s why you can’t just therapy yourself out of being trans

Not saying they don&#39;t, but many of us don&#39;t even have a surgery date. Some of us never will. There are many trans people who are at risk of COVID because of their employment. It sucks, but equating trans surgeries to life or death operations is beyond ignorant.

I just found out today that my consult that I made 9 months ago for next Wednesday has been cancelled and moved to May, because the surgeon isn’t seeing new patients.  I’m hoping it doesn’t get pushed back again.

As a trans nurse, I can say this is the right thing to do, even though it will be difficult and painful for a lot of people, it is for the greater good.

Hello all, I report on LGBT+ issues for the Thomson Reuters Foundation and am researching this issue for a potential story. I hope you don&#39;t mind me commenting on the thread. I&#39;m in touch with Mount Sinai and Facial Team, but I&#39;d also like to hear from people who have had their affirming surgeries delayed/cancelled recently. If anyone does want to get in touch the best way is email: [

](mailto:
<a href="mailto:rachel.savage@thomsonreuters.com">rachel.savage@thomsonreuters.com</a>

I hope you&#39;re all doing ok and staying well &amp; safe.

Take care, Rachel

Hi Rachel, I&#39;d suggest you make a new post in this sub. Your comment here won&#39;t be very visible.
</p>
<p>
I added a yellow flair to your username so people can see you&#39;re a reporter when you&#39;re on this sub.

Florida just announced resumption of elective surgeries statewide on May 4. So if you&#39;re seeing Dr. Mardirossian or other Florida docs in the nearish future you might be in luck.

My original date back in April was cancelled and it was the worst thing that could have happened to me - only a week beforehand. Now I&#39;m scheduled for July 21st and I don&#39;t know what I would do if it was postponed yet again. I understand the need to focus on the pandemic but they are gambling with our mental health and there are those of us who are suicidal without the surgery.

Hello, Lilia of FT here.
</p>
<p>
As our coordinators and the official published notice has advised, this was a really difficult decision to make but the first priority was to protect our patients, our staff and brace for uncertainties of the future. FT acted quickly, less than 24 hours after the emergency state in Spain was announced on Saturday, March 14th.
</p>
<p>
Staff are currently working under home quarantine until further notice (at least until the end of April) and the HC hospital (or any hospital for that matter) is unavailable at the moment. Subsequent updates are being posted on the same blog link &#34;Covid Advisory&#34; - all surgeries until the end of May are either rescheduled or pending a new date when the situation is clarified in patient&#39;s countries, where the pandemic is developing at different rates and border closures are indefinite right now.
</p>
<p>
In any case, please do let your coordinator know if you require further assistance, we remain here to help as best we can. Thanks for your understanding and patience. Check our social media for resources in the meantime about our activity, plans for the future and even talks to continue your research in FFS.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your feedback.
</p>

What angers me isn&#39;t the cancellation due to needing to reserve space and supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.  I fully understand and support that.
</p>
<p>
What angers me is that my GCS was originally scheduled for February 21, but was cancelled by the hospital less than 48 hours before it was scheduled to begin.  So I had to reschedule it for April 10, and it was cancelled due to the pandemic emergency.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
What I was told by my surgeon&#39;s office staff when the original date was cancelled was that the hospital suddenly decided that they were not going to allow that sort of surgery to be done in that hospital from that point on due to it being in conflict with their religious principals.
</p>
<p>
When I tried to complain to the group that the hospital was a member of, I got a letter saying that it was cancelled due to my primary insurance saying that they weren&#39;t going to cover it.  My primary insurance is Medicare. But even if they did say that they weren&#39;t going to cover it, my secondary insurance, which is a major medical health insurance policy not just a Medicare supplemental, would pay for it as if they were primary. So on the face of it their story doesn&#39;t make sense.
</p>
<p>
I have tried to contact my surgeon&#39;s office to see if I could get a letter from them stating who it was from the hospital contacted them, and exactly what that person said.  Unless I get this I don&#39;t know what steps, if any, I could take against the hospital

Does anyone know how long it should last? I just got an orchiectomy scheduled on Wednesday for 4/27. I was over the moon excited and now I&#39;m having severe anxiety over this. I do fortunately live in a less populated area so that may help, but this is just so shitty. Self love and hope is getting replaced by fear. I&#39;m done.

I don’t think I’ve seen any estimates, but I would expect until either most people have had it (assuming that makes you immune) or a vaccine is available.
</p>
<p>
I have read vaccines normally take 12 to 18 months to develop, so I’m guessing quite a while.

I had DB scheduled for next week. It was cancelled. I rescheduled for July but I think that’s optimistic. You will almost certainly be delayed and should plan accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Three weeks earlier and I would’ve gotten it. I was so close. I did everything perfectly except account for a pandemic apocalypse.

Figured I’d update. I had FFS rescheduled like 4 times. Kinda last minute they emailed and I did it 5/13. Recovering now. The hospital was a ghost town and you’ll have to do a COVID test. Not much to report. Oh and no visitors.

I had to reschedule mine to September but looking at all the recent spikes I&#39;m thinking it may get cancelled again but we&#39;ll see.

Sorry to hear your original appointment was cancelled, but I’m glad they could squeeze you in May. I haven’t heard much from them recently (understandably), so I’m curious when you say confirmed by the hospital, if that means they don’t plan to cancel elective procedures in May? As much as anyone can promise that, of course?

So, my
<em>
original
</em>
surgery date was actually May 22nd. Then COVID hit and a lot of people cancelled surgeries with DB. Long story short, April 14th was open and I live close, so I took it. Got my new paperwork from DB office with that date but we were waiting for the hospital to approve the surgery. The hospital officially said no and the next avail was May 5th. So I asked for that and evidently the hospital said yes. So as of right now I am having surgery May 5th. Have the paperwork, paid for, etc. But who knows.

Got it, thanks for sharing. I also live in SF, and was close to hopping on a mid April one as well.
</p>
<p>
I hope it sticks this time!

Fuck mine just got cancelled. I had FTM top surgery with Dr Grunwaldt at UPMC on May 7. Cancelled with no reschedule date in sight. Scheduler told me at least July if I can even get back in. I’ve never found it harder to get out of bed in the morning 😥

Doesn&#39;t it also mean surgeries that aren&#39;t emergencies but should be done as soon as possible, such as most heart and lung surgeries that aren&#39;t in an emergency situation? I wonder if getting a pacemaker or a defibrillator or treating cancer counts as elective or not. This is fascinating me now.

That&#39;s just horrible, and if those patients die as a result, then it&#39;s unforgivable, yet the virus could kill the patient if they catch it during surgery. It&#39;s so complicated.

Just to give you a data point, I had surgery scheduled with Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner in NYC for March 27, and her office called me on March 16th to notify me that my surgery was rescheduled for June 4.

Yeah, nothing is easy about being trans.

Education does make a fundamental difference to your entire life, and more is generally better. It’s not just the money, but generally a more satisfying career.

For dysphoria you could try to not concentrate on things you don´t like. Try to regularly do a few things you like, and try to concentrate on pos. things. This way you could avoid a downwards spiral.
</p>
<p>
And for momentary relief taking deep and slow breaths and trying to concentrate on the surrounding could help.
</p>
<p>
And if you keep looking for ways, there may be a solution eventually. Many take off between 4 and 6 weeks and it may be possible to find an opportunity during christmas, easter or summer break. Try to think positive and keep going. Suporn said they will fit in additional slots to help with a backlog. Other surgeons may do something similar.

is a list with online therapists that have written letters for surgery. Some also have a M.D. etc. so there should be some therapists there who fulfill their criteria. Additionally looking up reviews may be a good idea.

From Dr Garramone in Florida who does FTM top surgery, posted yesterday morning (3/23):
</p>
<p>
“Update: the State of Florida has banned all elective surgeries.
</p>
<p>
We will be rescheduling all patients who had surgery scheduled for the last week of March and the first week of April.

We will post updates as needed.”

My top surgery was scheduled for 4/6. In the grand scheme of things, I understand why it happened. I can simultaneously be sympathetic to the folks working to save lives right now, thankful it was cancelled for safety reasons, and frustrated that I now I have to wait longer (after my consult having been postponed twice).

You can add Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner to that list. Approximately a two-month delay.

Probably no way of knowing without just waiting. Hopefully the risk will go down to an acceptable level well before a vaccine is available, but there’s also the wait list to contend with.

I&#39;m having a hard time discerning the state of outpatient elective surgeries in Los Angeles county. Has anyone been able to resume a previously scheduled surgery like breast augmentation?

Before ceasing operations, they had already scheduled through July.  They will be prioritizing rebooking cancellations in August and September, and then will presumably start booking new patients after that.

Do you have any insights into how surgeons in general go about rescheduling canceled surgeries? Do they resume right where they left off and shift everyone&#39;s date accordingly, or is everyone&#39;s date fixed and they simply squeeze the canceled surgeries into slots as they open up? Right now I&#39;m scheduled in mid-September, and I&#39;m wondering if I should be planning to have to change my arrangements in case I get bumped back.

I don’t really know. I’d hope they try to be fair about it, and try to keep the original order, but I’m sure it’s going to be difficult. I expect it will be difficult from our side too, as many choose dates around education, work, etc.
</p>
<p>
Vaccines normally take 12 to 18 months to develop so I doubt this will be over anytime soon.

I spoke to my surgeons scheduler directly about this. My surgeon is going to start helping the hospital catch up with more urgent surgeries that were not originally her work and then she is going to keep order of her patients where she left off. But only as many as she can as she leaves in August so I probably won’t make it because I was one of the last on her list 🙃

Here were the news from South Korea:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/fi4eqp/south_korea_reports_more_recoveries_than/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/fi4eqp/south_korea_reports_more_recoveries_than/</a>
</p>
<p>
-more recoveries than new cases
</p>
<p>
-a rate of fatalities of 0.7 percent, due to extensive testing, which may reveal a more accurate rate.
</p>
<p>
Due to a different strategy of containment and a different age structure, there are differences in other countries but hopefully things are better in a few months.

At the moment it seems Italy is 10 days ahead of other western countries ... at least thats what I have read. So watching what happens there may be helpful.
</p>
<p>
The rate of fatalities that South Korea report are in line with estimates, they are lower than reported in countries with less extensive testing. There should be a surge and a peak eventually, like in South Korea. In western countries that have less of a strategy of containment, there should be more of a peak. So countries that have called off large gatherings early and have a population that was willing to play along, there should be less of a peak. In countries in Central Europe with people who played along there may be less of a peak, in the countries you mentioned more of it. But imo a real disaster is not likely. With calling off surgeries and preparing beds, there are additional capacities.
</p>
<p>
But its interesting that some western countries seem to have placed more value on keeping the economy going than implementing measures that would have been disruptive short term but may have prevented more of a peak. Only few countries found some kind of middle way.
</p>
<p>
We will see how it plays out, as said watching Italy may be an idea.

I should point out that this will depend on the location.  If the area where you&#39;re having your surgery done has hospitals reaching capacity, they&#39;ll cancel elective surgeries.  If not, the surgeries might not be canceled.  So having surgery done during this time IS possible, but you might want to make plans for the potential that they&#39;ll be postponed last minute.
</p>
<p>
For the record, I had surgery done by Dr Ley in Scottsdale, Arizona, on July 7.  While talking to the nurses, they told me that was my surgery just a couple of days later, it would have been canceled or delayed.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who are making travel plans around surgery, make sure you find out any refund policies the airline or hotel have.
</p>
<p>
Also, because of covid, my surgery was slightly different.  First, obviously, I had to do a covid test a few days before surgery and isolate between that test and the surgery itself.  Which meant getting a hotel with a mini fridge and microwave and eating that food for a few days pre-op.  Not a big problem, but I was kinda going stir crazy.  Second difference is, hospital policies don&#39;t always let you have visitors while inpatient anymore, so there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll be all alone while you recover.  There will be nurses there to help you out so you should be good on that front, but you may get lonely.

They&#39;re medically necessary for long term mental health, but if there&#39;s a risk to physical health to alleviate that mental health, I&#39;m going to put that physical health before it. I don&#39;t think they are taking this decision lightly.

I don&#39;t think you quite understand. You&#39;re not just risking your own health, you&#39;re risking everyone who you interact with&#39;s too. If you happen to get COVID-19 and are infectious with it you&#39;ll spread it to every nurse, doctor, and fellow patient you interact with. They may or may not be fine but their elderly family members, immunocompromised friends and family, or loved one&#39;s with underlying health issues might not be so lucky.
</p>
<p>
I understand how hard it is to have to wait more. But it&#39;s not just your life on the line.

<a href="/u/pleasehelpMDthrowawa">u/pleasehelpMDthrowawa</a>
- It&#39;s not even just the spread, either. It&#39;s preparing for the very real potential that we will need potentially as many as 5 times more hospital beds than we actually have in the United States. (That number is drawn from today&#39;s reporting on internal CDC forecasts).
</p>
<p>
People like us waiting for elective gender-related surgeries have a second chance. We have the option to postpone it, even if it means significant mental health impacts. It&#39;s not immediately necessary to sustain life. That&#39;s not true for someone who needs a ventilator. If a person who&#39;s done an elective surgery takes a bed and suddenly it&#39;s needed for someone on death&#39;s door? That person&#39;s dying, no postponing that.

I lose my insurance in November. If they postponed my surgeries I would not be able to just get them done later.. it&#39;s not something everyone can put off. If I don&#39;t get my ffs in April and srs in July I wont be able to afford them anytime in the foreseeable future. Possibly ever...

Elective surgeries include things like cancer resections and bypass surgeries. It&#39;s roughly anything other than emergencies where your physical body is unable to sustain life without immediate medical intervention.

Any health resources trans surgeries (or knee replacement or whatever else is being postponed) take up are resources that could be going to diagnose, treat and prevent the spread of the virus.
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging that coronavirus is more important
<em>
right now
</em>
is not saying that FFS/SRS/BA etc. are not important. Just like the fact that there are starving children in Africa does not mean that kids missing meals in the US isn&#39;t a big deal.

Many of those surgeons will switch to assisting coronavirus patients any way they can. Remember that although they specialize in certain surgeries, at the end of the day they&#39;re still doctors and are just as crucial to this as any other medical professional.

10% of coronavirus patients need intensive care and oxygen for weeks. They are going to die right now if they don’t get it, and many won’t. There’s no way any doctor will prioritise trans surgeries over that. They use scarce medical resources.
