I had top surgery (double incision with nipple grafts) in March of 2017. I ran into a couple of complications 1) a suture opened up at the corner of my left-hand side and 2) my nipple falling off at the left-hand side also (this caused to have different sized nipples and areola. I&#39;m hoping a tattoo will help this). Because I needed a couple of revisions, I got the ok to use scar treatments a year after my surgery. My experience with scar strips wasn&#39;t great, I tried various different ones throughout the years and it always ended up the same —giving my scars a rash. I gave up on trying to do anything and three years later I’m trying a new way of fading these scars.
</p>
<p>
I started using Mederma every other day. The days I don’t use Mederma I’ll be using a moisturizer. I was using
<em>
Vitamin E Fruit of the Earth
</em>
, but my scars didn’t react well to that. I’ve recently bought some plain organic and unrefined Shea butter and plan on using that instead. I also added massaging my scars in the shower as well.
</p>
<p>
Right now, here&#39;s how my scars look like:

To folks who have had top surgery and working on fading their scars, if you have any regimens that worked for you, let me know! Thanks in advance.

Look into c02 laser, it’s expensive but it’s very effective at treating scars.

My surgeon advised me to use silicone products (100% silicone) as they are most effective. So far the tape I’ve used seems to be working. But, my scars are still pretty fresh compared to you; I’m not sure if/how the effectiveness changes for older scars.
</p>
<p>
Not top surgery specific but I had read something about using needle and laser treatments to help reduce old surgical scars, and it looked pretty effective. That sort of thing seems to be done by dermatologists, so if the at home stuff isn’t working out it might be worth asking one what they think about it.

Scar creams don&#39;t work. CO2 laser and/or surgical revision.

I use bio oil on new cuts and stuff and the amount of scaring is about half as visable as similar cuts from before I found this stuff, it&#39;s great

I’ve heard bio oil works wonders for a lot of folks. Thank you for the suggestion!

I used strataderm gel on mine two times a day, everyday for a year, not sure if it helped, but my scars are pretty good for 1 year post op.

I’ve heard great things about strataderm. That’s great you were able to be consistent about it for a year. That’s my problem I have yet been able to stick with one regimen long enough to see if it works. Thanks for the help!

Apparently, a
<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022354916326521" rel="nofollow">meta-analysis
</a>
found that it&#39;s better to use oral vitamin E instead:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The use of vitamins E and C acid has   been   reported   to   help   accelerate   wound healing.181 Vitamin E is also capable of preserving important morphological and functional features of  biological  membranes 159 though  its  use  in topical  applications  has  however,  been  discouraged due to the problem of contact dermatitis.182
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Citation 182 is your paper. I think I&#39;m gonna write something about this if I have the motivation.

It would be great if you could write something on this. I&#39;m collecting info on scarring here
