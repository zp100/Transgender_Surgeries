Note: Dr. Markovsky&#39;s technique is a two-stage approach so this is not the end result. The second surgery will be in October and has the purpose of improving the overall aesthetics (and sometimes function).
</p>
<p>
Not much has changed since my last update. A week ago I had a check up with my new gynocologist and she was thrilled on how good everything looks inside and outside. She also strongly adivised me to cancel the second surgery (stage two/revision) because in her eyes there is no need for it. I personally will go for it anyways as I want some loose skin on the labia majora to be tightend.
</p>
<p>
Someone requested a picture of my labia spread so this time I added one along with a full body picture so you can get an idea of how my new parts look in proportion to the rest of me. Dr Markovsky divides the clitoris in 3 parts including two legs extending downwards. The excess urehtral skin is used to cover the area between the clitoris and urethral opening. They told me it will take a long time for the urethral opening to look less angry. It is still pretty swollen at that point.
</p>
<p>
Dilation goes well and I gained around 5mm of depth. (13cm+) I do it for 35 minutes once a day. Yesterday I was able to insert the large Vagiwell 5LS dilator halfway.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is good and I can reach orgasm with my fingers alone or a vibrator. They are not as explosive as my first orgasms after surgery but that just might be because I have them much more frequent now. 😄
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t expect many changes in the following months so my next update is probably going to be after stage two in October.

It&#39;s his version of the combined method so no penile inversion. The canal is mainly made from scrotal skin and if there is enough material on the penis he also uses some penile skin grafts. Part of the urethral skin is folded upwards and connected to the clitoris so everything is nice and pink. It&#39;s convenient that they remove the layer of the skin with the hair follicles so no electrolysis needed. :)

Dr. Markovsky and his Team don&#39;t use the urethral skin inside the vagina but they use it on the outside to cover the area between the pee hole and the clitoris.

No and unfortunately they can&#39;t guarantee you to get the exact surgeon you want.

I&#39;m not sure if this has already been asked somewhere but does health insurance pay for dilators or do you have to pay them?

Health insurance pays for it. You get the prescription for the Vagiwell Dilator Set one month before surgery at the pre op check up.

It pretty much feels like I always had her but it took about a month for the brain to fully understand where everything is located when I touch her.

It&#39;s still so fascinating how quickly your mind adjusts to changes like these tho.

I have no problems functionally. Sensation is great, I can pee without problems and dilation is pain free. But I assume being able to have penetrative sex without dilating beforehand isn&#39;t possible yet because my muscles down there are pretty tight. But I guess if I can dilate with the largest dilator easily it won&#39;t be a problem. Right now I can only insert it halfway but making progress every day.
</p>
<p>
The cool thing is that scars are going to fade and that this is only stage 1 of 2 so things will look even better in the long run. :)

I&#39;ll tell you for my Layman&#39;s observation you look much better than me and I&#39;ve never had a guy say my vagina looked strange but yours looks much more like what most women would like their vagina to look like and usually don&#39;t look that good.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s certainly a lot of progress since I had my surgery many years ago. My clitoris literally scabbed up and fell off. My labia major is too big, and my labia minor is hardly visible.
</p>
<p>
It was the best they had when I had my surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re able to control the muscles in your vaginal canal and push the dilator out, it&#39;s a good sign, being able to feel like a natural woman sexually. It will take some practice, but it comes second nature.

I&#39;m glad that in the end you could have a fullfilling sex life with your vagina but it must have been hard to deal with all these hassles.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s great to hear. Tbh I caaaan&#39;t wait to finally have sex with a guy even though I think it will be clumsy at first. :D And pushing the dilator out with my pelvic muscles works fine already. :)
</p>
<p>
Did your first time go smoothly? I hope it&#39;s okay to ask.

Oh yes, I picked a friend who was not really my boyfriend but we were very close and he really understood. He knew about my SRS and was really easy with me.
</p>
<p>
Once I had a regular BF, I didn&#39;t need to dilate anymore. I still would use the dilator on and off to keep up my exercises.

I&#39;m getting my lubos kitty end of the year and this looks incredible! First time I see a picture where the clit is so visible. Do they have to let it peek out this much? I guess it helps for stimulation since you allready have orgasms. I guess I never looked too close at cis vaginas to see how visible most clits are :D So jealous and can&#39;t wait 😊

It&#39;s actually completely covered by my labia minora if I don&#39;t spread them with my fingers but you are right. My clitoris is quit big but it&#39;s expected to shrink at least little bit because there is still some swelling.

Thanks! I didn&#39;t have any hair removal done but I would say that it totally depends on the surgeon if you can trust them with that. Just read as many reviews as you can to get an impression what to expect.

Thank you :)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not entirely sure because it was covered by public health insurance. (only had to pay 200€ extra for the hospital stay)
</p>
<p>
But I think another girl mentioned something around 24.000€ but it could be totally off by the time. You can always just get in touch with the surgery team via E-Mail and ask any question that you have.

I really appreciate your kind words but it was such a long and hard way to get the surgery that I really want to take any measure possible to get the best result I can. I think 95% of their patients go for the second stage (revision basically) and it&#39;s only a very simple and short surgery. All I want to be done is a bit of tightening on the labia majora. They purposely left a bit more skin there to accommodate for swelling.

This is incredible. She’s uncanny. How is your depth? Did you have a large donor site? And I’d love to know the cost I was never thinking about going private for bottom surgery (as it’s free in the U.K.) untill I saw this post. I’d pay good money for results like this. 😍

Thank you :) My depth is at around 13cm which isn&#39;t huge but considering my smaller than average donor site I&#39;m happy about it. I think it was helpful that I was uncut tho.
</p>
<p>
I think Tina Rashid would be a great option for the UK if you don&#39;t want to go private or am I wrong? Everybody&#39;s healing is different and you can get complications with any surgeon so if I was you I would try to stay within my insurance to be covered when something doesn&#39;t go to plan or if you have problems in the long run.

Yes it&#39;s completely covered by public health insurance. I only had to pay 200€ contribution for the hospital bed.

have you had electrolysis done beforehand? also, what’s the difference between Bogenhausen and Pasing when making an appointment (sorry if that’s a dumb question, i’m not german but i’m interested in going to this clinic and they don’t have an english website 🥲)
