I agree with your order (especially FFS first since it has the biggest impact socially), but save VFS for last. I had FFS and BA after VFS and it took my voice back to a pre-VFS state. I‚Äôm getting it redone in three months. Huge waste of money because I didn‚Äôt save it for last.

I went with Dr. Haben and he told me the same thing. They did use a smaller tube, and they said it went in with absolutely no friction, but being intubated for 8 hours takes its toll regardless of how big the tube is.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve also heard that the results of web glottoplasty are delicate in general and in some cases it can reverse itself over a few years. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true, but based on my experience it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going with Dr. Thomas in Portland for my next VFS. He makes changes to your actual voice box so the results are more aggressive and permanent.

I did the minimally invasive with Haben. I‚Äôm really excited and hopeful for my surgery with Dr. Thomas. FemLar results are so dramatic üòç

Dr. Thomas also warns people to do VFS last, I would definitely reorder this

Which surgeon was it damaged your voice? They are supposed to be aware of this issue and avoid it.

I‚Äôm not going to name names. They took every precaution they could have. I already had horrible results from VFS, intubation just aggravated them.

Sounds like its risky even with a good anesthetist. That&#39;s a worry.

Yours is the first post I&#39;ve seen highlighting this particular risk. Its always been anetists not being careful before, and even then there very little first hand info on it. Thanks for mentioning it.

I&#39;m sorry to hear this happened! I really hope this is a fluke because this has scared the crap out of me.
</p>
<p>
I had VFS done with Dr Haben earlier this year and am going in for FFS in a week and a half. During my follow-up with Haben I mentioned this FFS surgery and he said that everything should be permanently in place by then. He did recommend that I repeat the same steroids I took with his surgery though. The doctor for FFS knows about this surgery and will be using the small breathing tube.
</p>
<p>
How far apart was your VFS from your next surgery? Dr Haben wants 6 months at least but will approve you at 3 months if you come for an in person follow up. I&#39;ve had an 8 month window between.

Hopefully you‚Äôre fine then. I equipped my anesthesiologist with the same information but in my case it didn‚Äôt help. I had FFS 7 months after VFS. How are your results in general from VFS though? Because mine were pretty awful to begin with. And being intubated just made everything worse than it already was.
</p>
<p>
Edit: as for permanence, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that VFS is a relatively new and evolving procedure and there‚Äôs no guarantee of permanency. Web glottoplasty has had a few reports of reversion after a few years. It‚Äôs incredibly rare, but after my experience I don‚Äôt doubt it. I only just found this out when I booked my second VFS with Dr. Thomas.

I am really happy with the results of my VFS, the only issue is I&#39;m just missing volume. I can&#39;t shout too loud and it is hard to talk over people in a noisy room. This has improved with time but needs to improve more. Dr Haben has said it could take a year and I&#39;m not too worried. I still need FFS but my voice and adams apple were my biggest flaws and it just made sense to fix those first.
</p>
<p>
I really hope the second time is easier for you and your recover is much faster. 30 days of not talking was miserable. It was nearly 2 months before I could speak decently.

I‚Äôm glad yours worked out for the best. Leading up to FFS, my voice was in the girl range, but from day one I‚Äôve had this bitonal quality in the upper range. It sounds awful, like a witch. Means I can‚Äôt really use any variance in my voice or sing. After FFS it was deep. Back to pre-VFS levels. Since then it has levelled out a bit but it‚Äôs still back to a male voice.

I combined my BA with FFS. Best decision ever. You go through periods of disappointment in the FFS recovery but it‚Äôs nice to have awesome boobs to cheer you up when you‚Äôre down.

In that case you might want to save BA for last. Even after 4 years on hormones, mine grew noticeably after my BA. Not sure why. But it happens. And 6 months on HRT is nothing. Most growth happens in the second year.

The only issue I see, is that if you try for all that in one year, you might not have room for any bumps in the road. If something comes up with any one of those you might have to reschedule everything after it because that is a tight timeline.

You&#39;ll be fine with Dr Bank.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen his work on a couple of patients firsthand, as well as a few Suporn patients (since I am a Suporn patient myself). He is
<em>
excellent
</em>
, definitely up there with Suporn himself. He&#39;s been Suporn&#39;s extra pair of hands in SRS for years and Suporn is an absolute perfectionist; the fact Suporn trusts him with his technique and his name is a reflection of how good Bank is.
</p>
<p>
Whether it&#39;s Bank or Suporn, you&#39;ll be in incredible hands either way.

Just in case you&#39;ve not seen this
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index/content.md">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index</a>
</p>
<p>
Since you&#39;ve only just started HRT I&#39;d hold off on the BA for at least a couple of years, probably more.
</p>
<p>
Probably same for BBL, plus its an unusually dangerous surgery at the moment. Plus is not yet not clear if the recent recommendations are making any difference to the death rate. Presumably the rate of complications is even worse.
</p>
<p>
Consider doing BA with fat transfer since you&#39;re interested in BBL.
</p>
<p>
You want to sleep face down after BBL, but the opposite after BA.
</p>
<p>
VFS last due to the risk of damage to voice from intubation, but both Suporn and Facial team are well aware of this issue. I don&#39;t know what the risk is when you have competent anesthetists.
</p>
<p>
After SRS with Suporn you have to dilate very regularly for the first months to a year, and having any other serious surgery might interfere with this. Probably best to do it probably do it after FFS and BA.
</p>
<p>
It seems like Dr Bank is turning out even better than Suporn.

I had FFS, VFS, BA and I&#39;m prepping for lower surgery all this year
</p>
<p>
it&#39;s a lot of anesthesia, I was hit hard during my BA, keep in mind you may not be able to go under that many times in a year without effect.

You&#39;re looking at something like $70k-$100k worth of surgery there. Do you have that kind of money?

Even if you have insurance in the US that covers the procedures, I&#39;ve never heard of it covering the international doctors. You are pretty much locked into having it done in the US.

Brazilian butt lift, they will take fat from different areas and transplant it to give you a rounder butt or a more padded set of hips.
