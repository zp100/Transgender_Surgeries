I had gcs with Dr. Bella Avanessian in NYC during Summer 2022. I&#39;m ~13 months out and thought I would share some pics, as most pictures I see here are from earlier on in recovery. I would consider myself fully healed aside from some lingering internal granulation that I&#39;ve been getting silver nitrate for every few months and some residual swelling in my labia majora (I see it going down very gradually).
</p>
<p>
Very happy with sensation, I&#39;ve been able to orgasm from manual clit stimulation, vibrator, penetration alone, and clit/penetration combo. My first orgasm was ~3 weeks post op, and they have gotten much more enjoyable and easier to achieve since then.
</p>
<p>
The granulation has caused me ongoing discharge and smell issues since month 3, which has been a source of a lot of shame and distress for me, but since identifying it as granulation-related and getting treatment, it&#39;s much more manageable and I&#39;m hopeful it will be completely resolved eventually.
</p>
<p>
As far as aesthetics, I&#39;m not 100% happy, but am planning on getting a revision once my psyche can handle another bout of surgical recovery. What I want for my revision is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Remove the ~2.5cm &#34;skin bridge&#34; along the bottom of my vulva which means anything going inside me has to be angled down as first; it also makes penetration just a little more difficult
</li>
<li>
Create more labia minora
</li>
<li>
Remove any lingering granulation inside
</li>
<li>
Fix the &#34;dog ears&#34; where my incision end on top, and hopefully fix some of the lumpiness of my labia majora there as well (see last 2 pics for what I mean)
</li>
<li>
Create anterior and/or posterior commissure (I have not asked Bella about this so not sure if it&#39;s possible, but I feel it would help the aesthetics a lot).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let me know if you have any questions!

It looks indistinguishable from a cis gender!!!  This forum is so great for many who are considering the right surgeon and the respective pro and cons. Thank you…

I’m planning to go with Avanessian and might be biased, but I think the aesthetics are good overall and also agree with your decision to get a minor revision. The only improvements I can see would be two of the ones you mentioned — removing the skin bridge and fixing the lumpiness near the top. These are minor changes and nothing like a major revision. Most surgeons Bella included do mini revisions like this

Thanks! Yeah I spoke with her a few weeks ago and she&#39;s in agreement about the revision. I didn&#39;t mention the lumpiness though, as I&#39;ve still been seeing changes in that area and know swelling can go down until 18 months, so I&#39;m suspending judgment for a few more months. I haven&#39;t really seen any photos of her revisions so not sure what to expect. Will def try to see her again before a revision to make sure I understand what&#39;s possible.

Wowww your clitoral hood is perfect. As far as aesthetics go I think you’d only need a labia minora revision if you realllyyyyy want it. It looks perfectly fine as is but I also understand the struggle of wanting everything to be unison &amp; symmetrical. (I’ve had 2 revisions on mine haha) The Doctor did a great job imo

i pushed surgery back a bunch of times for various reasons so i couldn&#39;t say exactly...I waited a few months for a consult? and then I think I&#39;ve heard people say like ~9 months. it really depends on hair removal, get started on that shit early because it takes forever, if you&#39;re done with hair removal i think they can squeeze people in earlier

Avanessian is generally (and maybe exclusively?) insurance pay so the price will depend more on your insurance than anything else. If you don’t have insurance coverage for vaginoplasty in the US, expect to pay like $100k+

Amazing aesthetics. I can&#39;t believe some people say neovaginas never pass. How is it functionally?

aww thanks :) functionally good!! i havent had sex with a cis man (yet) but getting fucked w/ a strap is awesome, cumming is not as easy as before surgery but i&#39;m still making my way up the learning curve, and it&#39;s definitely easier than it was 6 months ago
