documenting my penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr. Hyer. I will try to answer comments and DMs, but this is a throwaway and I do not check it often.

Note on the times - I have a habit of marking out things with detail to time; these times are as accurate as I can recall and are based on notes I wrote into my phone during initial recovery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 3 (Friday)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I woke up at 02:10 despite going to bed around 22:00, as my partner was freaking out about my catheter. I changed my pad at this time and noted that I wasn&#39;t dripping blood into the toilet (as I had been immediately after getting back to the Airbnb).
</p>
<p>
I properly woke up at 07:00, changed pads and took a look at everything in the mirror. I did notice that I frequently got something resembling bright red watery blood coming out of the urethra area near where the catheter connected. I message Dr. Hyer via Denver Health&#39;s MyChart app asking about this.
</p>
<p>
My mons pubis (which had a good deal of swelling from when I was sitting upright) was no longer swollen and firm. I put ice on it to assist with decreasing swelling.
</p>
<p>
At 10:50, Dr. Hyer&#39;s office called me on my phone to check up. When I asked about the urethra blood, they noted that was normal. They also stated that bloating from constipation was normal too - which was rapidly becoming a problem for me.
</p>
<p>
I ended up spending the next hour trying to poop, as it was starting to hurt. I (perhaps unwisely) tried using a finger to pull out some poop and hopefully start a bowel movement, but nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
I asked my partner to grab some laxatives and took a miralax (generic Safeway version) at 11:55 to try and loosen things.
</p>
<p>
As a humorous aside, I recall reading somewhere once that trans women can&#39;t have double penetration because of the positioning of neovagina relative to the anus. From my anal probing as I attempted to remove my poop, I think that&#39;s right; the vagina (and the packing) appeared to be preventing poop from moving.
</p>
<p>
At 12:30, I attempted another round of pooping. The miralax seemed to have been working, but I still had to pull poop out of my butt to relieve pressure. Things definitely felt a bit better though.
</p>
<p>
At 14:30, I once again spent some time on the toilet. It was at this time that some (about 3 inches) of vaginal packing started to fall out.
</p>
<p>
I tried calling Dr. Hyer&#39;s office at this time and got voicemail, so I ended up calling the Denver Health nurse line. Unsurprisingly, they had no idea what to do, so they told me to go to ER. We got to the ER at 15:15 and were discharged at 16:40. The solution provided by the OB/GYN nurse (sounded like Dr. Hyer&#39;s office has someone who staffs the ER) was just to cut the packing, so long as it isn&#39;t &#34;a lot coming out&#34;. The ER also recommended upgrading my laxatives to sennacot or milk of magnesia for constipation.
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, I recall that Carly had very specifically talked about what to do if the packing came out - trim it. There was no need to go to the ER; I simply panicked (probably in part due to my frustration with constipation) and ended up in the ER unnecessarily. Don&#39;t repeat what I did.
</p>
<p>
I took a dose of sennacot as soon as we got back to the Airbnb around 17:15. At this point, I was pretty frustrated with the constipation (and my own forgetfulness about the vaginal packing), so spent most of the time alternating with reading in bed and attempting to poop.
</p>
<p>
At 23:15, I finally got a massive big shit and cleared most of my abdominal pressure. Sennakot is some powerful stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 5 (Saturday)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
At 00:20, I was woken up again to have bowel movement part 2, which was a massive shart that again relieved a good deal of my bloating and pressure.
</p>
<p>
At 07:15, I had bowel movement #3, with more sharts and a feeling of general relief. At this time, I noticed that my stitches were starting to itch and get very lightly painful (a 1/10 on the pain scale, as opposed to no pain whatsoever previously).
</p>
<p>
At 09:50, I pooped again. The poops were starting to solidify a bit and be less like diarrhea, which made me think that my body was recovering from whatever the sennakot did to me.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the day was farily uneventful, aside from two more fairly large poops at 11:30 and 18:10. I&#39;m definitely a believer in the power of sennakot as a laxative, but it also leads to some anal fissures from the sheer volume of stuff coming out of the anus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 6 (Sunday)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was able to sleep through the night with only one instance of waking up (compared to 2-3 instances on previous nights). Swelling and edema from mons pubis definitely caused some discomfort and I had 1/10 pain around general surgery site. I noticed that the edema on the mons pubis appeared to have flattened overnight while sleeping, and that my bruising patterns were following gravity (I was sleeping on my left side, so there was more bruising on the left).
</p>
<p>
Once again, the day was uneventful, and I basically used the time to keep walking around and read books. I had been able to easily walk since discharge day and had no issues with mobility. My greatest discomfort was with the catheter, as I would frequently end up inadvertently putting pressure on the balloon of the catheter when I sat up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 7 - First Post-op Appointment (Monday)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The post-op appointment was at 13:00.
</p>
<p>
First, the vaginal packing came out. It definitely felt
<em>
weird
</em>
, and I was also pretty impressed that Dr. Hyer had managed to shove what appeared to be 10 feet of gauze into my vagina.
</p>
<p>
Before the catheter was removed, Carly filled my bladder with saline (through the catheter tube) so they could check that was I peeing fine. The catheter was then removed - it felt slightly painful coming out and bled quite a bit when it did, but evidently that was normal. Peeing was super messy but I had no issues getting rid of all the saline they put in there.
</p>
<p>
I was given post op care instructions, which more or less amounted to &#34;don&#39;t do anything too physical&#34; and &#34;keep taking your pain meds to help control inflammation even if you don&#39;t have pain.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I went to the physical therapist for dilation. The surgery notes indicated that Dr. Hyer used the green dilator, up to the 4th dot, to create the neovagina. Initial dilation at the office with the purple dilator (two sizes down from the green one) also got to the 4th dot, so I was pretty happy with that.
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of folks on reddit make a big fuss about hitting the 5th dot or going beyond. Personally, I only really want/need 4 inches of depth, so getting to the 4th dot (which is 5 inches) is more than sufficient for me.

Dilation wasn&#39;t particularly difficult at the start. Pain has increased slightly over time due to scar tissue at the entrance, but massaging the entrance with coconut oil (at the suggestion of the pelvic floor therapist) has helped considerably with keeping the entrance nice and flexible.
