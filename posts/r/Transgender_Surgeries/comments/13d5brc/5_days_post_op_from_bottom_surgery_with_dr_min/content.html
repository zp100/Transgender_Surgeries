5 days post op from bottom surgery with Dr Min Jun, also first solo dilation, made it to depth no issue. She‚Äôs still a bit swollen and bruised as to be expected.

I had my catheter and packing removed today. The packing towards the end was not fun, not super painful but just wasn‚Äôt to comfortable. I got to pee for the first time on my own since before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Dr Jun used the purple dilator on me and got to the desired depth, and then he had me do it on my own which was a lot easier and quicker doing it myself and I got to full depth no problem. I did my first solo dilation at my Airbnb about an hour ago and had no issue getting to depth, just took a minute due to tightness and having to relax my pelvic floor with some breathing.
</p>
<p>
She‚Äôs still swollen and bruised a bit, but I‚Äôm extremely satisfied with how she‚Äôs looking already at 5 days post op. I can‚Äôt wait to see the healing journey and how she will end up looking once fully healed. I‚Äôm so happy, my experience with Dr Jun, his PA Alex, The Crane Center and everyone at St Francis, Especially my nurse Karen she was the best. I can‚Äôt believe this has finally happened and I get to live with a designer pussy. ü•πüôåüèºü§≠üò∫üòé

That bad review is from a very disturbed patient. I‚Äôve been assured by other post op patients on a discord that I‚Äôm on about the things she has done and how difficult and up and down her posts/reactions have been. She needs to get some help and stop spreading false information out there, cause myself and other patients have not had that treatment, and I would make sure not to go to a doctor who would treat anyone like that, and I can assure you that Dr Jun is wonderful and has been very comforting during this entire process.

Wow, we must have been at the clinic at the same time! I think I was just a room over from you.
</p>
<p>
I had my pre-op appointment today, all set for the big day next Monday. It&#39;s been exciting reading your story, and I hope I have just as smooth of an experience as you!

Yeah pre op is at 11am that‚Äôs when mine was. I was at St Francis. I can‚Äôt speak for the nurses there but you‚Äôll be in good hands. Make sure you ice the area when you get to your room, you want to be doing this 24/7 it helps tremendously.

It looks great for 5 days, and really amazing labia work!
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm stuck between deciding on Dr. Figler in NC or Dr. Jin in SC.   Both are great doctors.   Just wondering did you contemplate other doctors?

Thank you. Yes I had a consultation with Dr Ramineni first the fall of last year but wasn‚Äôt overly impressed with his quick talking over a phone call. I had my consultation with Dr Jun over zoom he was great. I was interested in him from the beginning, but wanted to keep options open. I had a consultation with Dr Adam Bonnington he works alongside Dr Wittenberg in San Fran, he was great. It was ultimately between him and Dr Jun. I was scheduled for a consult with RBL in New York but the consult was in 2024. In my honest opinion Dr Juns aesthetics and stitch work is by far the best which is why I ultimately decided to go with him. Him and his staff and everyone at St Francis hospital were great. I‚Äôm extremely happy.

Oh wow that‚Äôs awesome. Hopefully you get room 1019 that‚Äôs what I was in, Dr Jun said it‚Äôs the best room in the hospital, it gets a bit stuffy in there so you‚Äôll want to open the window or ask for a fan. You‚Äôre able to stay the night with them because my partner was able to stay over with me, that room has a pull out couch to lay on.
