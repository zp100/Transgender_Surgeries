Tomorrow (6/1) it’ll be a week post op. I had my first Follow Up appointment with The gender and diversity Team at KU, everything seems great. I got my catheter removed and I was able to pee (it’s a bit complicated tho).
</p>
<p>
I was NOT able to start dilating because my vagina is waaay too swollen. To the point it’s even hard to find the vagina canal. The practitioner literally had to dig up my canal in order for her to find the dressing inside.  I was well aware of the state of my vagina and agreed to wait 7 more days for my second Follow Up.
</p>
<p>
I’m open to suggestions. I want to try everything and anything in order for the swelling to go down.
</p>
<p>
I’m currently using frozen green peas and a towel to ice my kitty. I’m aware if the Temperature is too low I could get frostbite.

I hope you&#39;re doing okay... this hospital really needs an ethics committee to provide guidance for Meredith Gray&#39;s team.

Heeey! I’m doing a lot better! Currently dilating and it’s just getting better and better everyday! One of my lips is still pretty swollen but it’s going down little by little! About to reach the third dot on the smallest dilator

wearing 2 pairs of underwear. Have your pad in the first pair.  Use ice pack (frozen veggies work fine)  Hold it in place with second pair of underwear.  Do 20 minutes on then off for a couple of hours.  Rest. Not a big enough ice pack to freeze your skin.  They make reusable ones on Amazon for women who have had babies.  Also reusable gyn cotton mesh underwear for after babies or surgery are really comfy.  Don&#39;t wear anything tight.  Bridget

Drink a lot of water.  With me now I don&#39;t have to strain or use a muscle to pee.  It seems more like just relaxing one and it comes out freely. I just finished my dilation for night time.

My wife used witch hazel pads between her v and sanitary pad after giving birth to our daughter.  I&#39;ve often wondered if those would work for post surgical swelling.  When i actually get my consult ill ask, but it&#39;s a ways out.  Lol

My nurse told me yesterday to wet the pads with witch hazel and put them In the freezer for a while. Then use them directly. Nothing too cold or frostbite could happen

My daughter is scheduled for a consult with Dr. Gray&#39;s nurse next week. Do you know how many vaginoplasties her team has performed? What is the wait time for surgery? We already have insurance approval and all hair removal is complete. Thanks

Yesss! I was told they’ve done more than 200 in the last 5 years. (Which I would believe; yesterday at my Follow Up I saw 4 more girl who got surgery the same day as I did. And they do that monthly).
</p>
<p>
Wait time is about 6months to a year-ish. (I was a bit late with my electrolisys and they told me if I wanted to move my surgery date the only option would be next summer. That was 2 months ago.)
</p>
<p>
ALWAYS remember to ask access to the book with other peoples’ results. Since their results are a bit different than most people in this subreddit. And believe me; Don’t be shy to ask any questions. Even if you might think it’s too embarrassing.
</p>
<p>
Now there’s a girl who shared her experience at KU and she included pictures. Just look up “Dr Gray” or “KU MED” and it should show up.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your journey! And feel free to contact me if you have any further questions!

Thank you! I  am so worried my daughter won&#39;t want to wait that long. She already has surgery approval with the Washington University team in St. Louis for July but I&#39;m concerned because they just don&#39;t have that much experience.  My daughter is 18 and she is extremely impatient.

I strongly understand that. But also remind her this surgery is a forever thing. Of course you can get revision. But ask her to do a lot more research and possibly contact more patients.  Honestly I saw a lot of people with great results (other surgeon’s work) but i didn’t have enough resources to go to another state.

Did you ever meet with Dr. Snyder-Warwick and Dr. Vricella in St. Louis? We live an equal distance from Kansas City and St. Louis but we have family in St. Louis so of course, St. Louis is more convenient for us.

Nope. Only with Dr Gray’s team. It was a no brainer for me. (I was also very inpatient and desperate to get surgery.)

Hello, are you still happy with your surgery results? My daughter is scheduled for bottom surgery with Dr. gray&#39;s team on Oct 25th. Is there a list of things we should get before surgery? Like a specific cushion to sit on, chuck pads for her bed ect... Thanks

Also! I honestly am happy with my results. This I must admit I got a lot of extra lose skin but I’m getting revision surgery about it soon! Also another thing that I’m not very pleased about is depth. After dilating for nearly 5 months, going to pelvic floor therapy and dilating as schedule, I only got 4 inches of depth.

Also another thing that I’m not very pleased about is depth. After dilating for nearly 5 months, going to pelvic floor therapy and dilating as schedule, I only got 4 inches of depth. Needless to say I got plenty of material to build a better and deeper vagina canal but the only thing that doctors say is I have to keep dilating. But my physical therapist told me this is about it. That the maximum I can gain is half an inch.

The 200 surgery thing is a lie. They told me I would be 140 and then after surgery said &#34;So how&#39;s it feel to be the 67th patient?&#34;

Well 67 is definitely better than the &#34;less than ten&#34; statement from the Washington University team.
