This little series of mine is going to be highlighting my experiences choosing Dr. Ramineni as my surgeon. My goal is to provide as much info as possible so that people can make an informed decision towards whether they would or wouldn&#39;t want him to be their surgeon. Especially since he does roughly 135 vaginoplasties a year, but not many people highlight their journeys from going with him. This part will be focusing on the morning leading into surgery, my process getting set up for surgery, and my first day of having a vagina!

</p>
<p>
The morning of my surgery I call right as my insurance&#39;s help desk opened and explained that it was BS that a previously authorized surgery (through my mom&#39;s previous insurance) would be denied after sooo much prep work: my mom taking FMLA, me denying jobs until I found one that fit my surgery timeline, bowel prep, etc. They claimed they had no idea it was previously authorized (Lie #7) even tho I stated that every time I called.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ramineni and his team being sweethearts kept reassuring me that I should just arrive at the hospital at my new time and said they would handle it. They badgered my insurance until they got a last minute peer to peer review scheduled. Then Dr. Ramineni bitched out my insurance for nitpicking my procedure. I got a personal call from him 30min before my planned surgery time stating that he got the authorization and was going to be taking me up soon.
</p>
<p>
I had a little fienting spell while getting my IV put in (my mom later reminded me I had POTS syndrome which I totally forgot about 🤦‍♀️). So I gave the pre-op nurses a lil scare. Dr. Ramineni came down to meet me at this point and was just talking about all the surgery stuff and reassuring me that even if my insurance had been jerks he would have either followed through with it probono or had done it on the coming Saturday (both things insurances have made him do before). He&#39;s so sweet and reassuring constantly and really helped put me at ease before everything. Then I got my epidural placed in my back (no where near as bad as I thought it would be).
</p>
<p>
Then I got scooted into the surgery room where after being knocked out I woke up 5ish hours later when I could talk to my mom and friend who came along for support. The nurses were soooo quick to relieve any and all pain! Technically I woke up 4ish hours after my surgery but I had 3.5-4/10 pain wise and the nurse was like &#34;I&#39;m on it! Any time your past discomfort and heading towards pain no matter how low on the scale let me know!&#34; Which just made me sleep until my visitors came in.
</p>
<p>
It was sooo nice being able to talk with my mom and BFF. My mom actually got a call from Dr. Ramineni who explained everything went beautifully and that I had perfect anatomy 🥰. I had a whole bunch of people to respond to and tell them everything went beautifully. Then eventually my mom and BFF had to leave and I kept dosing off until I got my own room around 10:30-11:30pm. I met with my mom and BFF one last time before they needed to go home and I got scooted to my room.
</p>
<p>
My new bed was initially really uncomfy + the buttons were finicky and didn&#39;t work well. So I asked the nurse if he could turn it off (big mistake on my end). I woke up 2hrs later after they left with 7.5-8/10 pain because the air mattress had deflated so my pelvis was just lying on the hard plastic. I called the nurse crying he rushed over in under 5min turned on my bed to reinflate it then immediately rushed to get me pain meds. He tried oxy first which only brought it down to 6.5/10 then an IV based one which within 6-10 minutes had relieved the pain before I fell back asleep!
</p>
<p>
All in all the I was just sooooo spent after being so stressed the night before thanks to BCBS being fucking asses. That I was still in a little shock that I had even had a vagina! It kept coming back to me every few hours that yes under all that dressing I had a pussy!!!! 🤯🤯🤯 Then a strange thought crossed my mind as I was dozing off in the early hours of the morning... I couldn&#39;t remember what a boner felt like. I couldn&#39;t remember what it even felt like having a phallus in general. I had heard people say that time and time again. But I didn&#39;t expect it to be so quick nor was I expecting the massive euphoria rush at 3am when I came to that revelation!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be stopping here for now and I&#39;ll continue to take time to type these big blocks of info in between my recovery naps. The next day was all rest which was honestly just a bunch of boring napping while excitedly waiting for when they were going to take my dressing off. But I don&#39;t want to spoil to soon so I&#39;ll leave it here for now! Have a great and beautiful day all you lovely people!! 🥰💖💗💞

Hey there! First, congrats on the new Puss, girl. Happy for you! 👏 I’m in the process of looking for a surgeon and was just laid off from my job. 🤦‍♀️ I was responsible for getting my company to amend their policies with BCBS and was
<em>
finally
</em>
going to be able to start with bottom surgery (I’ve already had an orchiectomy) — oh the irony! So, thanks for being open about your struggles with BCBS as I’m looking for a new insurance carrier. I’ll steer clear of them. Also, I wanted to follow you so that I can follow your journey. My account is a NSFW one, so I’m not expecting a follow or anything. I’ll keep an eye out in this sub for you. Again, congrats and best of luck on a speedy recovery!

Thank you so much! That&#39;s such BS that you got fired after literally helping the company you worked for change their policies. I hate late stage capitalism so much! 🙄
</p>
<p>
And I didn&#39;t know you could follow people on reddit?! That&#39;s an interesting lil thing to learn! I definitely be continuing my posts as I gain more energy during recovery. I have multiple days typed up in advance, but it still takes a lot out of me to format it in an enjoyable way. But I&#39;m trying to keep up with a post a day until I get caught up to more stagnant parts of my recovery! I wish you all the best trying to get new coverage for your bottom surgery journey!! 🥰💖💗💕❤️💞
