<p>
I&#39;m six months post-op, just had a consult with Miroslav Djordjevic about a cosmetic labiaplasty and during the exam he asked me where my urethra was located. Embarrassingly, I did not know the answer. I assumed it was in the vestibule and I just couldn&#39;t see it, but we determined it was inside my vagina. They found it in imaging an inch inside my vagina, which he believes may have been the result of a fistula during recovery.
</p>
<p>
I had a revision under local with Chettawut three weeks after my initial surgery and asked him why the catheter had went inside my vagina. He specifically stated my urethral opening was above my vaginal opening in the vestibule. Even if this was correct to begin with (and I&#39;m interested to hear from other of his patients) he would have clearly known there was a fistula during the revision. Yet I was never told and just learned about it today...six months later.
</p>
<p>
My simple cosmetic surgery just turned into a urethral reconstruction that will require me to be catheterized for two weeks. Catheters are my nightmare and it was by far the most painful and uncomfortable part of my surgery. Even if I didn&#39;t care about urine splattering everywhere, which btw Chett&#39;s rude and incompetent nurses told me was normal as in &#34;welcome to womanhood&#34;, Dr. Djordjevic told me this would lead to problems over years as obviously urine is not supposed to enter the vagina.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really quite upset by this. Everything else with my initial surgery went great and even cosmetic issues were minor and seen in all surgeons&#39; outcomes. I previously thought Chett was a jerk, but still worth going to for his results. But now knowing he performed surgery on me after a visible urethral fistula had formed, didn&#39;t correct it, and let me fly home as if everything was normal...
</p>
<p>
EDIT: In communicating with Dr. Chettawut, it has become clear there was no fistula and he intended to place the urethra where he did. He has stated this is because I had a large amount of erectile tissue that needed to be removed. My penis was average sized, which likely explains why numerous other patients of his have reported the same issue below. He also seems oblivious to the health consequences and refers to the placement as &#34;low&#34;, when in fact it is too far internally to be located through manual examination.

I&#39;m sorry this happened to you.  Stories like this are why I decided that I was ultimately better off sticking with a US surgeon. Thank you for sharing your experience.

<p>
I hope everything works out for you!

In addition to the advantages you mentioned, there is the fact that stricter medical licensing and harsher malpractice damages provide stronger incentives for proper patient care from American surgeons compared to Thai ones. That&#39;s not to say errors or deliberate negligence can&#39;t happen, but it&#39;s less likely.

It appears next to impossible to claim against US surgeons in these cases. There&#39;s a number of women who have had very poor surgery and none have got anywhere with it.

In a case like what OP is reporting, I don&#39;t see why it would be. If it&#39;s plausible that the surgeon noticed a fistula and ignored it, it would be an easy case for a malpractice lawyer. Comparing the situation to one with a Thai doctor, the potential damages are much higher (e.g. Thailand doesn&#39;t award damages for pain and suffering), collecting evidence would be easier, there is no need for recurrent international travel, the statute of limitations is longer, and there is no language barrier.

In practice there&#39;s a lot of really terrible srs cases in the USA and no one has ever won any legal case that I&#39;m aware of. It may be related to a lack of standards for this type of surgery, making it hard to show its done improperly. For many other types of surgery there are such standards.

To be fair I imagine a lot of the cases would be settled out of court and therefore not be part of the public record.

I spoke to someone about it and I think you just can&#39;t get lawyers to take it on. It doesn&#39;t work how I used to think it did. There&#39;s a bit of info in the wiki about it, though not much.
</p>
<p>
Personally I think you just have to pick the best surgeon you can to reduce the possibility of problems, then just hope. Also consider if the surgeon is going to help if you do have problems.

I agree that having a reputation for providing excellent aftercare is really important. Chett has claimed to do so but he charges for necessary revisions and leaves patients high and dry halfway around the world so I wouldn&#39;t want to take that chance.

I have have head of a fair number of problems that sound like they shouldn&#39;t be happening, and it appears he often refuses to do revisions even if you&#39;ll pay. It would worry me if I were considering him.
</p>
<p>
It is hard though when there&#39;s negative posts about all surgeons, and then you have to try to compare in detail. And its all scary.
</p>
<p>
This part is why I&#39;d not consider surgeons for which there&#39;s not a lot of information, which is most of them. It too hard to judge the risk.

He won&#39;t do cosmetic revisions for an additional fee if he doesn&#39;t think they&#39;re necessary. The most common example of this is the posterior fourchette. Everything is his way and he&#39;s a jerk.
</p>
<p>
All that said, there are still reasons to go to him. I have 7&#34; of depth, internal lubrication, and no internal hair except some by the opening that I&#39;m having treated later this week. That&#39;s without the difficulty Suporn&#39;s patients have dilating -- at six months I do it at most once a day and often skip days with no discomfort -- and 1.5&#34; more depth than the NYU PPT paper, which is much more invasive surgery, twenty times the cost due to the robot, and requires electrolysis on the penile skin.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can&#39;t say for certain I would have made a different decision. I&#39;m just frustrated so many surgeons who treat trans patients are egomaniacal and unethical and I know from experience this is a constant worldwide as I&#39;ve now had surgery in four and soon to be five countries (I&#39;m still incredulous as to how much I was downvoted for pushing back on simple xenophobia).

The action is deplorable, but what are the damages? I planned to have an additional surgery anyway for cosmetic purposes and the only difference for me is that I&#39;ll be catheterized for two weeks after. My insurance will cover everything and I&#39;ll be back to normal. What&#39;s the monetary value of having a suprapubic catheter in for two weeks? I&#39;ll still be able to work.
</p>
<p>
And that&#39;s assuming one could prove the fistula developed before he last examined me.

I&#39;m not asserting you personally have damages that you want compensation for or that you should seek out a malpractice attorney. I was talking about the stronger incentives that exist in America which dissuade a surgeon from ignoring issues in the first place. It seems to be a common occurrence in this sub that people report a lack of follow up care with foreign surgeons. Once you&#39;ve finished your SRS and you&#39;re out of their clinic, there isn&#39;t a whole lot motivating someone like Chettawut to help you out. Suing him in Thailand is a long-shot and the potential damages are minuscule compared to what an American surgeon would face.

Fair. We hear that here with US surgeons, though, to a lesser extent. Even living nearby, try getting an appointment with a doctor who doesn&#39;t want to hear your complaints. I&#39;ll again point to how Marci Bowers has treated Hannah Simpson.

That might be true depending on the circumstances, but at least within the US system there is some hope. And not to mention their reputation is on the line, as well. I don&#39;t think any foreigner has a shot a challenging a Thai doctor within their legal system.

I don&#39;t think you have a chance in either country. I&#39;ve always hoped that that the popular surgeons doing medical tourism would care for their reputations out of simple financial interest, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the case.

There&#39;s no licensing for SRS in the US. Neither plastic surgeons nor urologists are taught this in fellowship yet all would be considered &#34;board licensed&#34; performing it.

Yes, there isn&#39;t a particular vaginoplasty board certification just like there isn&#39;t a particular rhinoplasty board certification. But your American surgeon with either have a gynecology/urology or plastic surgery certification. You will also find that a reputable surgeon is not working alone but as part of a team that includes specialists in the areas they are not certified in personally.

The same certifications exist in other industrialized nations and the surgeons we discuss there hold them. But what matters more is expertise. Where do US based surgeons learn vaginoplasty techniques? Not in residency. Many learn from foreign surgeons. Many go to PAI because afaik they have the only formal vaginoplasty residency that&#39;s been operating for decades. Mt Sinai flew in Djordejvic to teach them and then hired him part time because no one in the US knows how to fix many complications he does. It&#39;s an international field.

This is why I&#39;m going with an Australian surgeon too. The aesthetics might be better (not guaranteed) using chett or suporn clinic, but Dr Ives office is literally 2 train stops away from my apartment. That peace of mind is worth a lot to me.

Thanks. But geography has nothing to do with it. The majority of US surgeons are far worse than the best Thai ones. Also note I&#39;ll likely have this corrected by a Serb.

I actually don&#39;t agree with you in terms of geography. Chett has been considered to be one of the best surgeons and yet he put your urethra in the wrong place, discovered it was messed up, didn&#39;t bother correcting it and then lied to you about the whole thing. Now you&#39;re going to another surgeon to have it corrected. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re defending him after all that.

Why do you think this had to do with him being located outside of the United States? And again, since you seemed to have missed it, the surgeon who is correcting this is also not located in the United States.

I think you&#39;re missing the point. The point is that I want to be closer to a surgeon and preferably one who is bound by stricter medical ethics than they seem to be practicing in Thailand these days.

I don&#39;t see what distance has to do with it. I didn&#39;t know to go in for a follow-up because everything seemed fine.
</p>
<p>
I also think your view of the state of medical ethics in the US is incredibly naive. You can read horror stories on here about US-based WPATH board members. I have one myself, actually.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I would caution against choosing among surgeons only in the city you live in. For the vast majority of Americans, this is greatly limiting. I live in the largest US city and there&#39;s only one surgeon here I would have even considered. SRS is still highly specialized and there are only a handful of experienced surgeons worldwide.

That&#39;s all fine and well and I respect your choices. Based on my own research I think Thailand is no longer the vaginoplasty Mecca it was hailed as in the 1970s and 80s.
</p>
<p>
I just commented to offer some sympathy and support. If you&#39;d rather argue about how your choice of surgeon (who botched your surgery and then lied about it) is still superior to a surgery I haven&#39;t even completed yet with a surgeon whose name I never mentioned that&#39;s fine, but I won&#39;t participate in this discussion any further.

My surgery wasn&#39;t &#34;botched&#34;. As someone else commented, this is a common complication.
</p>
<p>
I have 7&#34; of depth with no abdominal surgery and no additional skin grafts, can dilate with ease only twice a week after six months, have no hair on the scrotal graft without having done electrolysis, and an aesthetic result Djordjevic said was well above average out of the thousands he&#39;s seen. If you view this result as &#34;botched&#34; you&#39;ll be in for something else when you actually have surgery and realize some degree of complications are the norm.
</p>
<p>
And again, I&#39;m not defending Chettawut. I&#39;m arguing against your xenophobia and medical ignorance.

You made a long post about how upset you were about your urethra ending up in your vaginal canal and how your doctor lied about it. You are so confident in Chett that you are going to a different surgeon to have the problem fixed. Yet here you are arguing about my choice (which you know nothing about, btw) just to feel superior.
</p>
<p>
I think you need to take a step back and think about why you feel the need to be so defensive about this after you chose to post about it, get some therapy, and work out your other issues before you decide to disparage other members of the community.

Wow... You literally stated that surgeons in the US are superior to those everywhere else in the world. Then you said it was only that they&#39;re more ethical and located closer, when the latter does not even make sense -- I&#39;m located much closer to Montreal than California and equally close to Western Europe.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m assuming you live somewhere very insular if you can get away with spouting this sort of  bullshit and not constantly provoking outrage. I live in a city that&#39;s 1/3 immigrants, work for a company located outside the US, and spend roughly 1/4 of my time traveling internationally. I would get punched in the mouth talking like you do.
</p>
<p>
My post was medically matter of fact. You responded with a complete lack of decorum by referring to my vagina as &#34;botched&#34; and throwing in a xenophobic nonsequitor.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with your surgery. I hope that you&#39;re in the small minority of patients who have no complications whatsoever and that none of your surgical staff are foreigners.

It stopped being a &#34;common complication&#34; when he discovered it and then lied to you to cover it up. I mean,

Agreed. I was taking issue with the term &#34;botched&#34;, which is at best
<em>
rude as fuck
</em>
and imo inaccurate. Should I consider a result with less than 5&#34; of depth botched? I sure wouldn&#39;t be able to live with it, yet having a 4&#34; deep vagina is not considered a complication by most vaginoplasty surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I also still don&#39;t see how the ethical problem is a Thai thing. The most prominent US surgeon effectively caused a woman&#39;s clitoris to fall off and then told her it was a good result.

Same here. I think we might be in the same boat as OP. Admittedly I am stupid about anatomy.

<p>
Edit: I looked at my vagina in the mirror while peeing, and it definitely doesn&#39;t come out from where the urethra is supposed to be according to pictures I saw during a research. Welp.

Their email responses tend to be very underwhelming.

<p>
At least it is something that can be fixed. I might have a revision someday when I have the funds. Now I am scared of being clocked if I ever have sex. I am lesbian and with the slightly different labia minora placement AND the urethra as well, it is just too much. Oh well.

Yes, I hate it. I&#39;m now immediately filtering future surgeons out based on that sort of stuff. Want to bet the email is: &#34;Dr. Chettawut says your urethra was placed in the correct location&#34; ?
</p>
<p>
I went to Chett solely on the basis he was my best choice for the vaginal canal, not aesthetics. Didn&#39;t know migrating urethras were a thing in those more innocent times.

That is likely what the response will be, yes. Everything is always normal according to them.

Chett was my choice based on many things. I don&#39;t regret having surgery with him but stuff like this really sour the experience.

I think I might be in a similar spot (im around 10 months), I keep waiting for things to get better but it seems like this might be where things settle. Mine seems to be just inside where my vagina widens out to meet with my vulva. It struck me as a bit odd but ive been avoiding worrying about it until seeing this post... It seems this might be something of a more common issue, but I&#39;m not sure what to make of the fact.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting a bit sick of splattering though, it really tends to go everywhere.

Yep, the whole washing the butt with pee thing gets old, and I am only 11 weeks post op. With good lighting and a mirror you might be able to locate your urethral opening properly.
</p>
<p>
How do you feel about this whole misplace urethral opening thing? Would you want to have a revision to fix it?

The more I think about it, I think it may not have been a fistula and maybe he just lies about placement. All his photos point out that the urethra is located correctly, but it&#39;s suspicious it ends up right behind the suture connecting the scrotal graft to penile skin. Djordjevic&#39;s guess was it developed during dilation, but I remember being confused about the catheter going into my vagina as soon as I saw it after packing was removed.
</p>
<p>
And to be clear, when Djordjevic said it would lead to problems he seemed to imply in old age, possibly due to incontinence.

No. Mine is located behind the inverted penile skin, so just beyond one inch internally.

You know where a female urethral opening is located. If you cannot see one there, and the obvious thing I never thought to do is to use a mirror while urinating, you may want to go to a urologist who&#39;s familiar with vaginoplasty.

Cystoscopy. I was able to see the opening on a monitor as well as all the way up into my bladder. I was extremely anxious due to the experiences I&#39;ve had with catheters, but it was actually pretty easy and painless. No real irritation afterwards, even with urination.

They are fairly common directly after surgery, but long term I don&#39;t know any special reasons.

This is for cis-women, but perhaps it will help.

A lot of why I went to Chett over Suporn was due to the severe complications in a small minority of patients arising from some of his more ambitious techniques, e.g. scar tissue in the scrotal graft and too much erectile tissue.
</p>
<p>
I cannot compare attitude between the two. That&#39;s really the complaint here.

I&#39;m really sorry this has happened to you and I totally get you being upset by it. I had FFS five months ago and have messed up ears that need fixed which really pisses me off but that&#39;s nothing compared to what you&#39;re going through. I really hope things go well for you with the reconstruction.
</p>
<p>
Will Dr. Djordjevic be able to move the urethral opening to the correct position?
</p>
<p>
Did you contact Chet to see what he had to say?

Djordjevic made it seem pretty easy to correct. He said the surgery, including the labiaplasty, will likely take  about 90 minutes. I&#39;m just upset about having to be catheterized again. Although he did recommend a suprapubic catheter, which is supposed to be much more comfortable. From what I can tell it seems almost like, as
<a href="/u/PartPhysMama" rel="nofollow">u/PartPhysMama
</a>
said above, &#34;a penis just for peeing&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t contacted Chett yet, but will do so. I&#39;ve already decided I&#39;m not going back to him for a revision since he told me he wouldn&#39;t construct a posterior fourchette, which other surgeons will do. I have a consult with McGinn next month, but now doubt I&#39;ll have surgery with her since I have a functional issue and she&#39;s not a urologist.

That&#39;s great he thinks it&#39;ll be easy to correct. I totally get your apprehension with the catheter, for me having that out was the worst pain I had with the whole surgery. The suprapubic would be a lot more comfy especially if you&#39;re having surgery down there.
</p>
<p>
I hear you, peeing with a vulva is annoying. It&#39;s the only thing I miss.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m intrigued to hear what Chet will say when you do hear back from him. I&#39;m also annoyed with my FFS surgeon as he knew my ears were messed up but didn&#39;t say anything either, how hard is it to be honest and is that too much to ask for.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s annoying you won&#39;t make your consult with McGinn but maybe once you get things fixed you&#39;ll be able to and yeah if she&#39;s not a qualified urologist I think you&#39;re wise to wait.

Fwiw, I need FFS revisions as well. I think it&#39;s the norm when you combine so many procedures. Sounds a bit mean, but it seems to me most of the women who think everything went fine have low standards based on either age or their previous appearance.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t decided yet whether I&#39;ll keep my consult with McGinn. I emailed her staff to ask her experience with urethral reconstruction. To be clear, it&#39;s one or the other, not an additional surgery and then I&#39;d see McGinn after. This can be fixed along with the labiaplasty so really the only difference for me is the catheter. I planned on having a labiaplasty originally because the cosmetic results are always better than after the first surgery.

Well I guess in the grand scheme of FFS revisions my ears are not that serious or expensive to fix but it&#39;s annoying. The hilarious thing with FFS is though I don&#39;t really look different, I looked like a girl before so it&#39;s not like I really needed FFS but still.
</p>
<p>
Ah okay, well fingers crossed she&#39;s up on urology. Maybe even if she isn&#39;t she can get a urologist to step in for that part of the procedure.

Same. Whenever anyone says, &#34;FFS isn&#39;t about beauty, it&#39;s about making you look female,&#34; I know they have very different goals than me.

I&#39;m not sure why you keep implying McGinn was my first choice before I was aware of this complication. I feel very good about Djordjevic. He&#39;s known specifically for SRS revisions and has corrected this complication many times before. He also said it&#39;s not something most urologists would know how to do since urethrovaginal fistulas only present as surgical complications.

Urethral migration is a common complication of vaginoplasty. Sorry the nurses were rude to you about pee splatter (but they aren&#39;t wrong. If I could have a penis just for peeing, I&#39;d pee on myself a lot less... )

I hope your revision goes well and you end up with a beautiful result.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your SRS experience. Its stories like yours that we need to hear. Often times we don&#39;t hear the complications and after math involved with SRS or people sugar coat their stories. So thank you for sharing this personal surgical experience. And I hope Dr. Miroslav Djordjevic can help resolve your situation. I heard great things about him. Do you regret having the surgery?

<p>
No. It might be the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me and far from the most difficult.
</p>
<p>
I approached it as one thing in a long list of changes I needed to make to my body, but after a couple months of healing I started to feel this sense of lightness beyond what I&#39;ve felt from any cosmetic change.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had difficult orgasming my whole life and reached a point where I was somewhat sex repulsed and voluntarily celibate. Now my sex drive is back and I can orgasm very easily and strongly and am looking forward to being able to have sex like a normal person, something I never experienced either as a man or woman.
</p>
<p>
I approach clothing very differently and more confidently. I was in Seoul this summer and went to jjimjilbangs, sex-segregated nude bathhouses, several times and no one stared at me. I feel normal.

I’m joining this conversation late but I want to share that I also have the same issue with my urethra being extremely low in its placement. I got the minimal depth procedure and my urethra is basically where my vaginal canal should be if I had one. Peeing is stressful  because it never seems to be a straight stream, and I have to really get in there with a wipe to clean all the pee out. I’m definately not happy with my aesthetics, but that’s a whole other thing. I’ve been reading about Marci bowers doing revisions on chettawuts work, but I’m so afraid to have another surgery. The whole thing is overwhelming and I’ e been in the dark thinking this urethra situation was because of some complication during my surgery. Which was to take 4 hours but took 6.5 hours actually. Chett said it was because of “poor elasticity” of my skin but wouldn’t or couldn’t explain beyond that

Do you have a vaginal canal? If not then it&#39;s impossible for your urethra to be in the same location as mine. Mine is not &#34;low, it is interior.

well... from reading your post, and your comments i found a lot of similarity in our situations. sorry its not EXACTLY what you are experiencing, but this thread helped me learn that my urethral issue is pretty common and will need to be addressed... my vaginal is only an inch deep and my urethra is placed inside that inch, kinda pointing down and inside... not exact, but similar....so i guess thanks for the post, but i think you could be a little more sensitive to the post op surgical issues of another

I meant other patients who had the same surgery. Your urethra is located externally, mine is deep inside an internal organ. You can see yours, mine required medical imaging to locate. Yours can be left alone, mine requires correction because it will lead to serious health problems over time.

Look, I don&#39;t mean to be a bitch about it. It is helpful to hear from you in that your situation could not have been caused during healing.
