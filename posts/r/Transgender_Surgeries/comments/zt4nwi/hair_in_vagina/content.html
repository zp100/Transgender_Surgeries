I am curious, how is this dealt with?  Very near the introitus I guess laser or electrolysis could work.  How is it dealt with deep in the vaginal canal.  I hope there is a way without replacing the lining which would basically be an srs redo. I aminterested in what people have tried and what has worked. Charlie

I am pre op, but I consulted with a surgeon (Dr Slama) who has had cases of internal hairs. He doesn’t follicle scrap, so any hairs not removed with electro in advance will return internally. Dr Slama said when that happens if there are few hairs not causing issues for the patient, he leaves it. If the amount of hair is noticeable, then he would do an outpatient revision procedure to use surgical electrocautery tooling to remove them (but said he can only remove small sections at a time and so isn’t perfect and may need to be repeated). He recommended being thorough with hair removal pre-op.
</p>
<p>
I’m probably not going with Drs Oates and Slama but figured this might be helpful to you

They told me the reason they don’t do it is because the skin is really thin and scraping is damaging and may make it harder to heal. And also that scraping doesn’t guarantee they get everything.

I got colon vaginoplasty and my doctor told me a few times there is no need for electro. Apparently, with this type of surgery, because the inside is colon basically, there are no hair follicles on it. So

That’s because they do a follicle scrape. Now you can avoid the pain from that if you choose and have electrolysis done.

What? What are you talking about? There was no scrape, no pain... And besides, I&#39;m sure electrolysis hurts more since it&#39;s done live...

I guess I have a higher pain tolerance than most, but electrolysis never bothered me in the least compared to being zapped by a laser that hurt like the living daylights.

You aren’t “stuck” with it like others on here are saying, I’ve seen some girls say they’ve had it cauterised off by a gynaecologist.

This is why you are supposed to have extensive clearing done before surgery. Because for the most part there isn&#39;t any way to do it post op.

I&#39;ve been stewing on why I dislike this comment for a while and I finally realized why I don&#39;t. I want to start off by saying that I absolutely understand your comment most likely was to spread awareness towards getting hair removal pre-op.
</p>
<p>
But here is my big issue with it. This comes off vary victim blamey and isn&#39;t answering the question OP asked. It&#39;s similar to someone having an accident in their car that fucks a part of their body. Then when asking what resources they should go to to alleviate this issue. And someone comes along saying &#34;You know you statistically would have had a less of a chance of an accident if you took public transport and you kinda took that risk of your own valition”. Like ya that&#39;s a true statement, but in this hypothetical you don&#39;t know if said person takes public transport consistently and this was a  moment where they needed to drive.
</p>
<p>
Similar to the fact that you don&#39;t know if OP had gotten permanent hair removal before hand in this post. She isn&#39;t asking for what she should have done she asked what are the options she has now. So seeing this as one of the most upvoted comments makes me feel so bad for her when she wanted resources on how to solve her issues.

I am not blaming anyone, to the best of my knowledge you simply cannot get an electrolysis needle into a follicle when the skin is internal such as in a neo-vagina. Regardless of how you got to that point it&#39;s just not possible, and it isn&#39;t blaming or shaming to point out this very true and very unfortunate fact.
</p>
<p>
The simple truth is if there is an actual way to resolve this issue I have never heard of it. The fact others haven&#39;t corrected me on it shows that apparently nobody else has either.

I didn&#39;t mean to make you feel like you were being mean or anything! I was more trying to highlight that the wording wasn&#39;t the best because it wasn&#39;t answering the OPs question and just brought more attention towards the lack of research on how to solve this issue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not entirely versed on how to solve this issue either, but that&#39;s also why I didn&#39;t make a comment trying to answer her question. Others in this thread have brought up solutions. Are those solutions 100% proven and do they work? I&#39;m not sure, but they are directly trying to provide relief, support, and resources towards someone who asked for help. Hiddenstill&#39;s wiki has some reddit posts that have a girl that found a place willing to do deep canal electrolysis (albeit expensive af).
</p>
<p>
So I just think this falls under the category of if you can&#39;t help and you are just going to cause more worry maybe don&#39;t comment and let other people who do know answer. Either way I hope you have a great day and I&#39;m sending you good vibes regardless! 🥰

Flat saying that is so miss informing. Please dont do things like that. If the surgeon scrapes follices theres close to zero risk of having any internal hair. (Im saying close to. Cause theres alwaS some that can be mossed. Just as with laser hair removal!)

There&#39;s very little research, but there&#39;s plenty of post op women with internal hair. According to one paper its about 7%, which is far from zero.

Yes, follicle scraping is supposed to get most. But if any are missed and you have hair growth you are pretty much stuck with it. That is why most doctors suggest getting some electrolysis done prior to surgery.

Electrolysis damages the skin, so not ideal for surgery. Some surgeons don’t like it. I’m not sure how you’re supposed to balance these conflicting requirements, and surgeons are not helping by explaining it either.

Electrolysis does not damage the skin, if the proper settings are used - which is what an Electrologist who is properly trained (by an accredited school/instructor) would use. Electrolysis has been used since 1875 for permanently removing hair - and is the only method approved by the FDA as permanent hair removal.
</p>
<p>
The FDA Consumer Health Information Bulletin of 27 June 2007 states &#34;The US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes electrology as providing permanent hair removal, The FDA identification in Title 21, CFR, Sec 878.5350 for needle-type epilators is: &#34;a device intended to remove the hair by destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; As no other device for hair removal has the unique identification of &#34;destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; only electrologists are allowed to claim permanent hair removal in their advertising
