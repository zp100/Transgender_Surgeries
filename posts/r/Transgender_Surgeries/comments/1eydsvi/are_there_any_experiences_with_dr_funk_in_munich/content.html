Hello all,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m currently in the process of looking for FFS surgeons. One name I&#39;ve heard several times was Dr. Funk (
<a href="https://www.transgender-schoenheitsklinik.de/transgender-cosmetic-surgery.html">https://www.transgender-schoenheitsklinik.de/transgender-cosmetic-surgery.html</a>
). I had a consultation with him and he was very convincing. According to him he routinely does FFS (1-2 times a week since 10+ years). He also talks on TV about FFS surgeries.
</p>
<p>
What bugs me is, that there are almost no reviews or result images (one review on
<a href="/r/germantrans">r/germantrans</a>
and some comments in threads). I&#39;ve seen a handfull of people recommending him, and one post OP image. Apparently, he is well known in the local community and people go to him because they know someone who was there.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to do so many surgeries and have almost no reviews? Or is there anyone here who had FFS with him or knows of experience reports?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for any help!
</p>

I have two friends who went to him. Surgically, he&#39;s really good. He actually manages to feminise your face, but on a personal level, he&#39;s absolutely disgusting. Has really weird (trans)misogynistic views, says stuff like &#34;A trans woman is only a woman after I operated on her&#34; and after one patient had a really big scar from rhino he just said she can use make up to cover it up. Also, some of the meds he recommends afterwards are homeopathic, but you don&#39;t have to buy them, so.. Just my two cents

I&#39;ve also noticed that somewhat during the consultation. He said if i want to say I&#39;m a woman i have to really commit and do the whole surgery package. But i think i could put up with that, as long as the operation results are good. The homeopathic medications in the list he gave me also threw me off a little, but i thought i would just skip them. Do you by chance have any more info on the rhino scar? Did he do any revision to cover his mistake, or did he just leave it at that? And did she manage to minimize the scar in the end? Thanks!

I sadly don&#39;t. I heard that from an acquaintance who was part of a seminar where a lot of local doctors and surgeons were talking about trans health care. He (Dr Funk) showed pictures of his work, and this was part of that afaik. He&#39;s generally not well respected by others in the field since his personality is kinda shitty.

Somewhat understandable. I&#39;ve also talked with a friend who is a plastic and hand surgeon, and he has never heard of him before. But showing results with a flaw and making such a comment is really strange in a professional setting.

Thanks! It doesn&#39;t sound too bad tbh. Also,
<a href="/u/AmiesAdventures" rel="nofollow">u/AmiesAdventures</a>
was the one person with a post OP pic i&#39;ve seen so far.

You could try looking on the Facebook FFS groups, and thereâ€™s possibly a German one. However, I think the Facebook groups suffer from commercial bias.

I didn&#39;t know that there is a german ffs group, so far I&#39;m only in the bigger german discords groups, and there is almost nothing about him there except &#34;I heard he is good&#34;. I may have to take a look there, do you by chance know how the group is called?

I think there is, but not 100% sure. I don&#39;t use Facebook. There is a global FFS group.
</p>
<p>
Personally I&#39;d not use a surgeon without a lot of reviews. Its too risky.

I&#39;m trying to join it right now, but I will probably declined because I&#39;m not really using facebook and have no photos on there.
</p>
<p>
And i agree, the lack of reviews really throws me off. But going by that leaves almost only FT in the europe area, and I&#39;ve had some sketchy experiences with them during the consultations.

Only had a consultation with him, but...hoo boy. I can attest to the other voices here mentioning that he&#39;s pretty &#34;old school&#34; when it comes to what is a woman and what not. He mentioned some patient&#39;s story (maybe even one of the before-after pics he showed me) and said something like &#34;that person came to me, back then still a man, and left as a woman&#34;. And no, he didn&#39;t mean it in a way of saying they weren&#39;t out yet or anything. It was really just a &#34;get the surgery or you will never be a complete woman&#34; take. Doesn&#39;t pair well with all the trans pride flags on
<a href="https://www.transgender-schoenheitsklinik.de/ueber-uns.html" rel="nofollow">his website</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I think he showed me two before/after FFS pics. One was really good. The other looked like someone who obviously had plastic surgery, and when I mentioned that to him, pointing at the cheeks on that photo, he denied it and claims that it was just because that patient smiled. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the right person for a natural look.
</p>
<p>
He was also rather pushy on what &#34;needs to be done&#34;. I had had a consultation with FacialTeam before where we discussed a few things that could be done or not, where the FT surgeon also mentioned some things (like my nose, which others have complimented) being fine and some other things that would really make a difference. Dr. Funk insisted on doing a few more things, including my nose. The quote he gave me was also on a handwritten white 6cmx6cm paper, which was...not too professional. To be fair, he offered more than FacialTeam for a lower price at least.
</p>
<p>
One of the first things that happened when I entered his office was also a cis man complaining about necrosis after a hairline lowering, which was just brushed off as him not washing his hair correctly. Not a good look at all.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I didn&#39;t feel like going forward with him. FacialTeam made a way better impression on me, so I&#39;ll go to them. Which is a shame, as I live in Munich and it would have been easier to just go to Dr. Funk instead.

Heyo I read a lot into surgeons in Europe and went to a bunch of appointments including Funk recently you can send me a dm for more details if you wanna. Generally my gut feeling was unsympathic as a person but skilled as a surgeon which also mirrors the reviews and results I heard and saw. Facialteam was too one fits all for me and 2pass I&#39;m worried about the surgeons age despite his experience so funk made the best impression overall so far especially since he answered all my critical questions well.
