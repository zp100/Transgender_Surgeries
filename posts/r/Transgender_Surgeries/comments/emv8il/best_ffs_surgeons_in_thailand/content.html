Thailand is not known for FFS or fat transfer. Great for SRS, but that‚Äôs not on your list.
</p>
<p>
You might have problems with fat transfer and ffs at the same time as you can‚Äôt rest on the area where you put the fat for quite a long time.
</p>
<p>
Have a look in the wiki here.

ditto what hiddenstill said, this is just my personal opinion (I&#39;m not a doctor I&#39;m just someone who hangs out a lot in FFS spaces) but I have not heard of a single doctor in Thailand that is suitable for FFS. if you are wanting to save money I think you will have a MUCH better experience looking into doctors in Latin America, such as Emilio Torres, Marcello Di Maggio, and Jesus Baez (in no particular order).

Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.  Was wondering why nothing spectacular was coming up wrt Thailand, I&#39;d just heard they were the go-to in general.

No problem! I would go with one of the established doctors down there but there are tons of women from the US who have gone to the doctors I mentioned (well, Baez is newer but his work is quite promising, I personally love his rhinoplasty aesthetic), and they got great results. Jess Ting actually recently did a live-broadcast surgery with Di Maggio in New York, meaning these guys are good enough that some American surgeons are trying to learn from them.
</p>
<p>
These doctors are also very easy to approach online if you want to communicate with any of them. Emilio Torres actually tried to send me a friend request on Facebook lmfao.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck!!

Di Maggio seems like he&#39;s got a ton of good reviews, with pictures, and some ladies look like ten years younger besides, but I&#39;m also seeing horror stories about people&#39;s skulls falling in and having to be patched up?  Oof.

I had FFS with Di Maggio last year and I&#39;m really quite unhappy I went with him. I had a revision surgery last month to fix the problems he caused and the surgeon who did the revision said the surgical technique Di Maggio used was not good. The revision did improve things but I&#39;m stuck with scarred and weird deformed ears that I can&#39;t bear to look at.
</p>
<p>
I have other issues with him but I&#39;m going to make a post about my experience.

Your Mileage May Vary lol ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I had never heard that before that&#39;s terrifying. I personally am lucky enough to have insurance that should cover FFS.
</p>
<p>
oh and just on the off chance if you weren&#39;t already aware, if you don&#39;t work in tech already, Starbucks and Amazon (even warehouse workers) offer insurance that covers FFS. I know of at least a few people who quit their jobs to go work at Starbucks for two years to get everything covered.
</p>
<p>
Idk if that&#39;s feesible for your situation but thought I&#39;d throw it out there.

I&#39;d risk sepsis with the shadiest back-alley surgeon before I worked for Amazon, tbh.  I&#39;ve got some money, I just don&#39;t want to spend it *all* on my body.  There&#39;s house payments to consider and all.

No reason other than &#34;much cheaper than US, with quality being similar&#34; but after checking around it does appear that that aphorism mostly applies to GRS, and since I&#39;m pretty OK with my equipment overall that&#39;s not a priority.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you&#39;ve gotta be laid up overseas for a few weeks, might as well be in a tropical paradise amirite

I&#39;m not sure I would enjoy humidity if I&#39;m not in a bikini and can run into the ocean.
</p>
<p>
I understand the costs can be scary.  There are alternatives to db or speigel that are more affordable.
</p>
<p>
But please don&#39;t get a Walmart face.  If you&#39;re getting type 3, which most of us need, you should be spending $15k minimum with all the other procedures.

Mercifully I probably don&#39;t need a type iii to pass, I got a lot of my mom&#39;s features.  My curse is giant shoulders and a v. prominent nose.
</p>
<p>
At any rate i am not looking at Thailand presently.

Like everyone said. I&#39;ve seen way more horror stories of ffs in Thailand than success. Latin America, spain, and Korea all have better and a little cheaper FFS
