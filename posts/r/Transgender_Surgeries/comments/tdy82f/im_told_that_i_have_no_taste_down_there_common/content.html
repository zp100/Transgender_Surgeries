I&#39;m told that I have no taste down there. Common for women with a neovagina or is it just me?

For context, I wash my vulva with scentless castille soap every other day when I shower, as well as using boric acid suppositories twice weekly to keep any odors at bay.

I&#39;m not sure this is accurate? I have received multiple reviews of my vag and everyone seems to agree: tastes/smells like a cis vag.
<br>
I wash my vulva, but don&#39;t put any soaps or anything but water into my vagina.

I see! Be wonderful if I could have recommendations for specific products and how often to use them. I wonder what I&#39;d even be looking for ingredients wise. Do I ditch the boric acid and start douching too? I have so many more questions but thank you nonetheless.

You&#39;re an absolute saint. These would be going up the vagina, right?

See, that&#39;s what I worry about. Surely our vaginas aren&#39;t hooked up the same way, certainly not any types that came from inversions. Hoping I&#39;m wrong.

Not sure but with hormones and how the tissue changes I donâ€™t see why it would be that much different

Depending on the type of vaginoplasty youve had you may be washing it incorrectly. For the majority of cis women there is no need at all to use soaps or washes inside of the vagina, only around the outside to make sure the area is clean, between the labia only clean water and thats it. The only times that soaps and washes are needed are when there is an infection to get rid of or because due to your procedure you have different washing requirements.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, everyone is different so some people just dont have a smell and you may be one of them. However do look into the procedure you had and if it is typically necesarry to use soaps or any washes etc on the inside or differently to cis methods, if there are no special requirements you should consider no longer using soaps or washes on the inside (unless i misunderstood and this isnt what you meant) for atleast a week and seeing how this changes things. If there are no negative changes then you provably never needed soap in the first place but if things get out of control then you were probavly doing what is right for you all along

Maybe he just is used to strongly scented women. Maybe he had just had a strongly scented meal. Maybe he has a weak nose. My point is that one of comments aren&#39;t worth much
