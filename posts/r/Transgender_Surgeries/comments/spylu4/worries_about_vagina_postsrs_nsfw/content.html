Hi,
</p>
<p>
I was lucky enough to have SRS with Mr Larner two years ago, and have seen a huge life quality improvement.Recently though, my labia appear really red and more swollen than usual - I was wondering if anyone with more experience could tell me if this was normal/what the probable cause is? There&#39;s also a slight slickness around my vulva, which I&#39;m now no longer sure is normal.
</p>
<p>
Pics attached below - any advice would be hugely appreciated.

<p>
Edit: Thank you all, I&#39;m feeling a bit more reassured and will visit my gp if the swelling flares up again! I can 100% recommend Mr Larner as a surgeon, he does amazing work - and if there&#39;s anything wrong almost 2 years post-op, that&#39;s on the patient.

I don’t have any advice but I wanted to ask, did Mr Larner require electrolysis? I’m guessing this was done in Brighton?

It was (I&#39;d also definitely recommend Brighton as a hospital, it felt more like a hotel stay than a hospital visit)!
<br>
Mr Larner checks in the pre-surgery appointment whether electrolysis is needed, so it depends on your hair placement and thickness whether it will be required or not. I was fortunate enough not to need it, but I know others have.

Thanks for letting me know! I don’t have long to decide between London or Brighton. Did Larner leave you with adequate depth?

Sorry to hijack your thread but it’s so rare to speak to people with results from them

Happy to talk about it in more depth (no pun intended) but would you mind if I PM&#39;ed you instead to keep the thread clear? :)

Sometimes the vaginal canal can slightly prolapse with PI vaginoplasty, and very rarely the whole canal will prolapse. I’m not an expert so I would ask your surgeon if maybe a partial prolapse has occurred? You look amazing and I wouldn’t stress because it’s always most likely not anything scary like a prolapse.

is it tender to the touch or warm(er than usual)? may be a skin infection? honestly though the pics dont look bad and we as an internet audience cant tell how much of a deviation this is from your normal. How long has this been going on? if over a week id go to Dr and have it checked out, just in case

Not tender, and about the same as usual, maybe slightly warmer?
<br>
It was going on for three days, however starting to look better now with regards to the swelling (which could have been skin irritation from shaving. It&#39;s mostly the colour change now that I&#39;m uncertain about...

Regarding the slight color change I would suspect that it was irritated skin somehow - either due to urinary leakage or vaginal discharge.

If continues to improve i wouldnt worry (take a break from shaving until its better tho and use a good chemical free moisturizer- aquafir or similar), if it doesnt improve completely in the next few days or starts worsening then follow up with dr.
</p>
<p>
edit: if youre unsure about warmth it isnt warm, youd know for sure especially after 3 days
