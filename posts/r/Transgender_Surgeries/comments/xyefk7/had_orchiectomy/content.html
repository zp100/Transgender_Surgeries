Sure. This is can happen even when you pick the right surgeon.  A lot of people have been in your shoes with surgery. Would you care to provide details as to what went wrong?

if i hit reply does that mean you see this? i never done anything like this before in life! anyways i went to see a urologist the beginning of the year and surgery was scheduled i had my orchiectomy but something must have went horribly wrong cause i was in a lot of pain and i was not getting better could barely walk couldn&#39;t bend down or anything i felt like a old person in life! time went on the surgeon who did my surgery wouldn&#39;t see me let alone help me other doctors said they couldn&#39;t help me either finally ended up going to see another urologist who also said she could not help me was referred out to a general surgeon who determined i had a hernia had surgery two weeks ago am still recovering but i hope to be back on my feet in time for the holidays i will see how that goes?

hey, I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re having this experience :/ I know it&#39;s really stressful to have a botched, incapacitating surgery happen and throw a wrench in your life like that- your doctor not doing what sounds like responsible followup care is even worse.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t let this deter you from future surgery you might have, like BA as you mentioned below, though- in my experience doctors try to wash their hands of what they think could become malpractice suits and in that case I would recommend starting with your general practitioner who can point you towards doctors who specialize in the region who can help.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you found a urologist in this case and they can help you, which is great news! but don&#39;t think this means &#34;I can never get surgery again&#34; or anything just because of your original surgeon&#39;s poor conduct. My SRS surgeon basically abandoned me after my surgery, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the doctors I&#39;ve seen at home who have helped the complications haven&#39;t been supportive and helped me manage the consequences.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in your healing and I hope any future operations, if you choose to pursue them, go well!

thank you for your thoughts here wow sorry you had a negative experience from srs surgery if i am understanding correctly here i do not understand why doctors or surgeons cannot be more human in their treatment of what is suppose to be their patients in life however? i will keep that in mind about any future operations as well i hope your transition is going well for you i hope it brings you much happiness in life as well?

I&#39;m sorry to hear all that. It certainly doesn&#39;t sound like you supportive gender affirming care. Who was supposed to follow up with you for post-surgery care?  Was the hernia a result of the orchiectomy or were these two separate issues? Are you saying that no physician will help you with either issue?
</p>
<p>
FYI - This is why is a good idea to do as much research as possible, when it comes to trans-healthcare. Seek out others who may have traveled the same path with with the same surgeon.

that is exactly what i am saying no doctor would help me the hernia was a direct result of the orchiectomy that was done on me i appreciate and thank you for the advice i will remember this just in case i need it down the road. this journey is hard enough without having it made more difficult by unforeseen things adding to it.

You might want to look through the Wiki
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index//content.md" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index/</a>
</p>
<p>
You may be able to find better resources closer to home. This is typically one of the least difficult surgeries you can have. These kind of complications are the last thing you need for something more invasive like GRS or FFS.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of help here. You just need to speak up if you need it.

Would you mind naming the surgeon who did your orchiectomy.

They will, that&#39;s why I collect names and add surgeons to the wiki here, so people can review their surgeons and make an informed choice.
