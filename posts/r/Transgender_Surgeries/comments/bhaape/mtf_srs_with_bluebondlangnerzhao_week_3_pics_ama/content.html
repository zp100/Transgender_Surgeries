4/16, 12 Days Post Op
</h1>
<p>
This was supposed to be the day of my first post-op appointment, but they rescheduled it for 4/17. Not much to say here, I spent most of the day writing and responding to last week&#39;s AMA.

</h1>
<p>
Today was my first post op appointment, which was at 10AM. After I was discharged, I saved a few of the oxycontin for travel days, and I&#39;m glad I did. The taxi ride over to the hospital was fine, but be sure to bring the waffle cushion with you. It helps a lot.
</p>
<p>
As an aside, one thing I sorta don&#39;t like about this team is how crazy busy they are right now. Early posts about BBL always went on and on about her great bedside manner, but at this point, she&#39;s so busy that you don&#39;t really get much chance to feel like you&#39;ve actually met her. In-hospital visits are in-and-out in under two minutes, discharge day packing removal and dilation is over in 10 minutes, and followups are scheduled for 15 minutes (and never take nearly that long).
</p>
<p>
Now, she and her team are great -- everyone is always friendly and willing to answer any questions -- but you are clearly just another patient and they clearly have a lot of others to get to, so don&#39;t expect any more. I&#39;m fine with this, but from earlier posts I sorta had a different expectation. If you have questions, be prepared to just jump in with them. They won&#39;t ask or spend any more time with you than they absolutely have to.
</p>
<p>
But anyway! She says I&#39;m healing up nicely and told me to start massaging the hematomas and swollen tissues to help break them up faster. She aspirates the left labia majora with a needle and gets a lot of the blood out, though it&#39;s still very swollen (you can see the two punctures
<a href="https://imgur.com/Em3voVa">here</a>
). She tells me to start using aquacel (a antimicrobial bandage material) on the stitching around the canal to help them heal faster.

We celebrated the holiday with some amazing donuts from a nearby bakery. YUM.
</p>
<p>
For fun, here&#39;s something different:
<a href="https://imgur.com/H9AfhKZ">post-dilation</a>
. Rawr. Check out those teeth.
</p>
<p>
Today was pretty rough, tbh. One of the stitches inside my labia minora got
<a href="https://imgur.com/cJ95uRy">super irritated and started bleeding</a>
. BBL does the standard penile-inversion trick of using the urethra to line this area, and this irritated spot was adjacent to former urethra tissue. My nerves (which still have no idea WTF is going on) interpreted this irritation as similar to the burning and stinging associated with a UTI, and I spent a few days feeling like I always had to pee. And the stinging/burning drove me up a wall. Ugh. Still, despite the pain, I&#39;m endlessly fascinated by how our bodies adjust to the rebuilt anatomy.
</p>
<p>
I cleaned it up and put a folded piece of aquacel between my lips, and kept it slathered with bactroban when not using aquacel. It cleared up in a day or two.

<p>
I included a
<a href="https://imgur.com/Gy1xuY0">top-down POV</a>
of my vulva to give an idea of how it appears when I look down. While I&#39;m really happy with the work my surgeons did, especially on my labia and hood, I hate looking down at it right now. It looks like a bad tuck with an escaped testicle because of the swelling! I can&#39;t wait for the swelling to go down and for things to look &#34;right&#34;.

<p>
This was my second post-op appointment, and also the day I left NYC.
</p>
<p>
My wife and I took a taxi to the appointment. I took 2.5 mg of oxycontin right before leaving, which helped when it took about an hour because of heavy traffic. At the appointment, I hear Dr. Bluebond ask for a 10 mL syringe and 23G needle, just like she did last week. I involuntarily whimper out a pathetic &#34;noooooo...&#34; when I hear this, and she grants me a reprieve. I shall not be aspirated on this day. Honestly, I&#39;d rather just wait for the old blood to break down naturally than deal with having a needle poked into that poor, bruised, sensitive tissue.
</p>
<p>
She instead grabs the scissors to start snipping stitches that are ready to come out. After the rushed appointment last meeting, I came prepared with a few questions for things that I&#39;d been curious about, and figured this would be a good time to ask them. I&#39;m fascinated by the process of SRS and how an artist like Dr. Bluebond actually carries out the creation of a functional, aesthetically pleasing vulva, and I can&#39;t pass up the opportunity to pick her brain a bit.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to have to paraphrase her responses. I don&#39;t remember them exactly because I was lowkey freaking out about having someone poking about my new vagina with tweezers and scissors. She wasn&#39;t this terse and was happy to answer them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Q: I can see that my labia majora are made of intact flaps of scrotal skin, and the outside of my labia minora are intact flaps from the top/sides of the shaft skin. But what&#39;s used to line the inner lips of the minora?
</p>
<p>
A: Penile skin.
</p>
<p>
Q: In between the labia minora, is urethral tissue used? (I mentioned the UTI sensation)
</p>
<p>
A: Yep, that&#39;s how it would feel.
</p>
<p>
Q: What part of the glans is used for the clitoris? Is it the entire glans buried under there?
</p>
<p>
A: No, it&#39;s just the highly sensitive tissue from the outer layer -- the internal tissue is removed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I know it&#39;s not how it works, but I can&#39;t help imagining a
<a href="https://imgur.com/00X8YM0">melon baller</a>
when I hear that...
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Q: Will it look like the glans still? When I can look up under my hood, will I see something that looks like a glans?
</p>
<p>
A: Nope, it&#39;s more of a little bean.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
She tells me that everything looks good and to keep using the aquacel for a few weeks as the canal entrance heals. My wife and I catch a taxi over to Penn Station to catch our train, which we managed to do with literally seconds to spare.
</p>
<p>
I took my second 2.5 mg oxy when we got on the train. It&#39;s about three hour ride, but it goes well. I used my waffle cushion and didn&#39;t have any significant pain, and was able to comfortably use the train&#39;s restroom without any problems.
</p>
<p>
After that, it was another hour by taxi to our house. We spent about 7 hours traveling and at appointments that day and while I was exhausted, it wasn&#39;t terrible.

4/24, 20 Days Post Op
</h1>
<p>
Had a fairly active first day back home. Did a bit of unpacking, some cooking, lots of walking around the house. I&#39;m begrudgingly continuing to keep up with the schedule of dilating, douching, cleaning, icing, massaging, heating, and medicating required, but omfg I&#39;m so ready for it to be over.
</p>
<p>
I took a peek
<a href="https://imgur.com/xuBkmBC">between my labia</a>
again to check on that irritated stitch, and it definitely looks a lot better. Also, that&#39;s my first glimpse of my clitoris! It&#39;s definitely still healing and all-pain-no-pleasure right now, it&#39;s exciting to see :)
</p>
<h1>
Wrap up
</h1>
<p>
Recovery is surprisingly fast, but it can feel misleading. There are times when I feel no pain and can walk around and do pretty much anything within reason, but then there are still times that something-or-other down there is stinging and I can&#39;t get comfortable. So it&#39;s pretty variable whether I can even move at a given moment, but I&#39;m not stuck in bed or anything.
</p>
<p>
Care and maintenance continues to be a chore. I don&#39;t like my vagina very much at this point. I&#39;m happy I did the surgery, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll love the result some day, but I&#39;m not there yet. It&#39;s just a high-maintenance, needy, painful, and bruised literal cunt right now. I&#39;m looking forward to having some fun with it, but I have yet to feel terribly positive about it. I&#39;m happy the old bits are gone, but the new bits aren&#39;t my friends yet. We&#39;re still getting to know each other.
</p>
<p>
That said, I have noticed a sort of peace with my transition lately. There&#39;s something about the finality of this surgery -- it&#39;s such a major achievement that the little &#34;but what if it&#39;s a mistake?&#34; voice has finally shut up for me. I&#39;ve gone through so much to get to where I am, and I haven&#39;t regretted a single step of it. Now that I&#39;ve made it through SRS, there&#39;s not much room for doubting any part of my transition. It feels good, like some sort of closure.

It was unexpected and I only realized this last night. YMMV, I&#39;ve heard of people having a wide range of reactions to SRS. But for me, it only solidifies that I&#39;m fully me and I&#39;ll never have to be that miserable person from before again.

Wow, great detail!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure this was in an earlier post but where are these Drs located?
</p>
<p>
So, many of the pics I&#39;ve seen, the labia are barely noticeable.  Yours seem better defined or larger?  Is this up to the surgeon or something you can request?

My labia and hood are pretty amazing so far, in my opinion. I&#39;m really happy with Dr. Bluebond&#39;s work and glad I chose them. I&#39;ve been impressed with her other results, in particular
<a href="/u/Dhaliah_Elaine">u/Dhaliah_Elaine</a>
&#39;s results
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_rachel_bluebond-langner_.28ny.29">here</a>
stand out as having the type of labia I want. My overall result looks quite different right now, particularly the outer labia, but I&#39;m very curious to see what happens as the swelling goes away.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
I&#39;ve heard of some surgeons talking to the patient to find out what to prioritize -- aesthetics, depth, etc. I think that&#39;s more common when there&#39;s limited material to work with.
</p>
<p>
They never asked me any questions along those lines, and when I asked them about it, I was told by her PA essentially &#34;you just get what you get.&#34; I was a little disappointed by this, but I trusted her to do good work and felt comfortable letting her choose based on what material was available to use.
</p>
<p>
I asked over email, though, and I didn&#39;t ask her directly. Maybe if you manage to ask her personally during one of the few face-to-face meetings pre-op she&#39;d be willing to take some requests.

Maybe it seems silly to want but it&#39;s how I imagine my vagina?  Sure, I&#39;ll take anything but idk, feels important to me, more than depth :/

It&#39;s definitely not weird! Everyone has their own goals with the surgery, and that&#39;s okay!
</p>
<p>
It also seems like there aren&#39;t really any trade offs between those things in practice, unless there just isn&#39;t a lot of donor tissue to work with or there are complications. It&#39;s very common to hear of results that have decent look, feel, and depth together. I think the only aspects we even could have control over are cosmetic details (large vs. small labia, for instance).
