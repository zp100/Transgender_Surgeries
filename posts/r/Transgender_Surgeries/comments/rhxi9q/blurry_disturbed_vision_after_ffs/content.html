3 weeks ago i had FFS, it went well but ever since i woke up, i have this vision problem.
</p>
<p>
When i am tired or it is darker than daylight, i have trouble focussing on the TV, or my phone.
</p>
<p>
I do wear glasses but am not allowed to wear then for 2 months due the rhinoplasty but i can not remember it being this bad, i walked around without glasses all day..
</p>
<p>
Is this something that have happened to you guys and girls as well? I am getting worried..

FFS 3 weeks ago, and I have the same issue. I figured it’s the new tensions of the muscles around the eyes, + the presslift I’m wearing most of the time.

i had surgery a week ago and am here searching reddit for awnsers too as ive never head of vision getting blurry after. My doctor only said that i wouldn&#39;t be able to see because of swelling but i figure that was more of my body being soo swollen it obscures my sight.
</p>
<p>
I also where glasses due to astigmatism and got rhino and really wondering if its the astigmatism and all the healing the body does and im on pain killers so i really don&#39;t experience just how much my body is going through as much? ima just call tomorrow and see
