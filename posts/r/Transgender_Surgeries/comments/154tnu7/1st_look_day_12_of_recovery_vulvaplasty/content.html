I&#39;m doing pretty well! My pain has been really well managed, getting better and better every day. I think I get my packing out today and then my cathedar tomorrow, so I should be able to go home after that. Got transferred from the hospital to MaiTri a few days ago. She came by to see me before I left and said there were no complications. I&#39;ve really liked her calm demeanor through the entire process

TMI stuff - been able to have a few bowel movements (Miralax ftw), and swelling has been going down steadily. The worst part is some shooting pain around my bits from my nerves waking up, but it&#39;s been nothing higher than a &#34;6&#34; on my pain scale.

Sorry for the detailed response ðŸ˜… been meaning to do a follow-up post soon. Think I will in a few days when I go home.
