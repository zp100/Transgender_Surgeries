I&#39;ve had a couple of surgeries with him and thought it was pretty neat to see some behind-the-scenes footage and interviews.

I&#39;m still in awe when I step in or see footage of the office ðŸ™ƒ
</p>
<p>
I noticed he posted it to fb but I don&#39;t think that gets much visibility nowadays.

I definitely won&#39;t disagree with you about most of us not having access to good FFS surgeons. There&#39;s a lot of luck that is needed to be part of that seemingly small percentage of transwomen that can be stealth and can 100% integrate back into society alongside cis women. Having genetics on your side and parents with money seems to be the holy grail.
</p>
<p>
I will say that I&#39;m not young and grew up down the street from the projects. Once I hit puberty and started growing body hair I gave up my favorite things as a child, such as swimming and going to water parks. I withdrew from society and for the next 14 years didn&#39;t wear shorts, go on vacation, or step foot in a pool. Video games were my outlet and mirrors were my enemy.
</p>
<p>
I too had to save up cash as an engineer.  My face mostly passes now thanks to FFS with DB but my body doesn&#39;t (I&#39;m almost 6&#39;1&#34; with a wide rib cage and a 10&#34; hand span) so many transwomen who went on blockers or had an easy puberty still pass better than I do without the need for surgeries. A lot of my body features aren&#39;t &#39;fixable&#39;. I could go into this more but don&#39;t want to be too negative about everything.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve received quotes from other good (not FFS) surgeons who charge more for similar procedures and I&#39;ve also heard of other FFS surgeons now charging more than DB because of the backlog of patients. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a huge quote gap between what I would consider A-tier and B-tier FFS surgeons as I&#39;ve seen many quotes from friends and acquaintances, but many patients are forced to go to whoever their insurance approves.
</p>
<p>
I would easily give up my career and any money I have left to go back in time and convince my 13-year-old self to go on blockers, but I can&#39;t. We can only do the best that we can given our current situation and hope that the next generation has access to the things that we didn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
For those that went through male puberty and don&#39;t have a tech degree, fighting for insurance coverage with good surgeons is the next best thing. Starbucks is the best example I can give.

I&#39;m at Starbucks right now just for the insurance coverage and have been for over 2 years now. I wish to God I could go to DB but he only does in-person consults and I live on the east coast and can&#39;t afford to travel just for a consult even though the actual surgery itself would likely be covered. Besides that I still haven&#39;t been able to claw my way out of all the stress, depression, and anxiety I have to actually jump through all the hoops that I need to to even get the process started despite having the insurance for about a year now. It&#39;s so bad that I&#39;m actually going to run out of hormones for a couple weeks because my injectables are tied up on red tape and I can&#39;t afford to just pay out of pocket and I can&#39;t get in to see my doctor for a new prescription in time.

Just a heads up Dr. Rolfes in Minnesota does as good if not better work for a fraction of the cost; in a few years he&#39;ll be mentioned in the same breath as Dr. DB, Lee, etc.

Apparently if you go through Starbucks they will cover DB directly, or so I&#39;ve been told by many people on here. That seems doable for most trans people, and I&#39;m thankful that SBUX can help people pick the best surgeon in the world.
