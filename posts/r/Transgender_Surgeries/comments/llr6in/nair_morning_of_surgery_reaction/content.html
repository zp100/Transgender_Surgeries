So I used nair as instructed by my surgeon the morning of and it made a mess of my chest. It’s red and burning and there are some blisters. I didn’t even have it on 3 min (says to do 6min) before immediately removing it. I did do test areas prior to this day and they were fine but I’m wondering if I just screwed myself for getting surgery this morning.

I have never ever been asked to perform my own hair removal prior to surgery. In fact I’ve been explicitly warned NOT to and to let the surgical team do it.

That makes sense. It was in my surgery booklet though and I was reminded by the hospital staff the day before to shave. My chest is looking okay now but is still sore in some areas. I was told it is normal and won’t affect anything by the intake nurse

Yeah. I’m just gonna throw this out there that having a patient do any hair removal on their own like that is highly unusual. A few days before? Ok but the night before / day of? Definitely not.

That’s good to know. I just got out of surgery about an hour and a half ago and all went well. But I appreciate your comment and everyone else’s! They are super helpful!

I think veet is easier on your skin. I react to nair the same way but veet is just fine.

I will write that down for next time I need to use something. I just went with what they recommended but I guess I should’ve looked into the products more as I’ve never used them. Thank you!

The best thing to do would be try to get in touch so your surgeon ASAP and see what they tell you to do. I hope things can proceed without issue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a surgeon or a doctor but telling a patient to apply a chemical depilator to the surgical area the morning of surgery seems like an incredibly bad and irresponsible idea, especially to an area of the body that is usually extra sensitive to them.
</p>
<p>
I usually just hear about folks being asked to shower with a special soap like Hibiclens to disinfect the area ahead of surgery, and as far as I was aware usually hair removal via shaving gets done by the surgical team at the start of surgical procedures that require it to avoid accidental cuts or knicks or other damage to the tissues by the patient.

I was told I had to shower the night before surgery with the medical scrub and then do hair removal the morning of and scrub again with the medical stuff. I think the problem was that my skin is normally sensitive but since it was stripped by the medical scrub it reacted when I used the nair. My surgery is in the next two hours and I’m at the hospital for it and they said we would have to wait for my surgeon to see it and decide. The redness has gone down a lot and it’s not burning or itching as much. The only slightly sore spots are on either side of my belly button but not near the top surgery site

This stuff works wonders and doesn&#39;t irritate skin...any skin, even super sensitive genital skin.
