Title. According to the video, when getting your browbone or jaw shaved down, there is a 15-20% chance of losing all feeling and/or muscle control in that part of your face. Is this really the case, or are they just trying to scare people away?
</p>
<p>
The hospital in question is the Amsterdam UMC in the Netherlands if that&#39;s relevant.

Personally Iâ€™d stay well away from them. Thereâ€™s better surgeons.

Hmm i see, but i&#39;m afraid that my insurance wouldn&#39;t cover other ones and i don&#39;t know how i would afford to get surgery done at other places... is this one truly that bad compared to other places?

Doesnâ€™t sound good and thereâ€™s basically  no reviews so itâ€™s quite a big risk. You could try looking for local people elsewhere. Perhaps Facebook, but thereâ€™s some serious bias on Facebook so be careful.

My understanding is that there may be at least a 15% chance of *temporarily* losing feeling in parts of the face, yes.

It&#39;s a mandatory video that everyone supposedly has to watch if they want to get FFS here, i was thinking about it maybe being a bit of a scare tactic?

While those figures &#39;seem&#39; high (I don&#39;t have any actual support to refute or support them), both certainly carry a decent risk in those areas. I permanently (or at least I would assume to be permanent being 14 months post op at this point) lost feeling through about 1/3 of the top of my head. Not the worst, but still very odd feeling (I&#39;ve bumped my head incredibly hard a few times due to an awkwardly placed lighting fixture and literally didn&#39;t feel what should have been pretty excruciating lol).
</p>
<p>
I also had a sliding genioplasty and jaw shave, and one of those procedures absolutely damaged the main nerve that runs from your lower gumline all through your face and back to your ear (if you check a facial nerve diagram on google the larger nerve I&#39;m referring to should stick out). This does bother me significantly every day, enough that some days it feels awkward speaking until I&#39;ve &#39;warmed up&#39; and feeling never properly came back in the bottom right part of my gumline (but the stiffness and nerve damage in the jaw area is easily the most bothersome). My experience seems to be pretty uncommon, but I&#39;m still to this day not certain it was worth it (and I lean towards regretting it personally as I expect this will be a bigger issue as I age, on top of the high cost to begin with). Definitely not pushing you either way, but there are realistic considerations that need to be weighed with dysphoria.

Even for a common and simple surgery such as breast augmentation, there is a 5% - 10% chance of permanent loss of nipple sensation. Thatâ€™s not just for trans women, but for all women.
</p>
<p>
So it makes sense that there is a greater risk of permanent nerve loss in facial surgery, where there are a lot more nerves that are cut. We see beautiful before/after pictures of FFS results, and understandably want those results for ourselves. But every surgery carries risks, and itâ€™s important to understand those risks before choosing to undergo surgery.

As to what I&#39;ve read about Brigitte Meijer (I&#39;m guessing she is still the ffs surgeon at aumc), she has done a bad job causing functional issues a few times, probably due to inexperience with ffs specifically. There are anecdotes on t-nederland and there was once one in volkskrant where they interviewed patients with complications.
</p>
<p>
At the same time there are a lot of patients very happy with her work. She might have also improved now she has been doing ffs for longer. Perhaps it would be worth talking to her about what she does to mitigate the risks for example etc. and to see if that inspires confidence.
</p>
<p>
In any case the statistics from the video are not very good, FT has published some scientific papers about their way of doing forehead work for example and have much better stats.

Sorry for the late response but she is indeed the ffs surgeon at UMC! Do you happen to know if FacialTeam is covered by dutch insurance? I think that might be the way to go i.o. her...

Facialteam is pretty much for sure not covered by dutch insurance. It is maybe possible to with a long legal fight get a (small) part of it covered, Nicky de Jong has made videos about trying to get her surgery at 2pass covered.
</p>
<p>
In the end she got just standard amounts for the procedures as they would be in the Netherlands, in no way comparable to what you pay with private clinics like 2pass or Facialteam. This only after going to court as well...

Had FFS with Facialteam, they made it sound like the risk is minimal.. and I didn&#39;t have any loss of sensation personally, healed perfectly.
</p>
<p>
I am guessing the method and preparation of the doctors make a big difference... Facialteam takes CT scans and carefully moves the nerves aside as they operate.

Its up to you ofc ... there is a service called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ucqeo/virtual_ffs_experiences/e93gg97/" rel="nofollow">virtualFFS
</a>
and consulting them in case may be a good idea. They also know surgeons. It may be necessary to discuss with them the kind of approach though. A standard may be a moderate approach. Be aware that with a more aggressive approach results can look more mask like, and less individual.
</p>
<p>
They could make a few suggestions including a minimal one. More details are
