It was pretty straightforward! I got in at 7am and got a gown and a bed, then just waited for 45 minutes. A little before 8 a bunch of people started coming in, double checking if I had done bowel prep, confirming medications, getting the IV started, etc.  Briefly met with the anesthesiologist and with Dr. Gast, then I was rolled down to the OR and completely out by 8:30. I was in the recovery room and briefly conscious around 1pm (I tend to shake off anesthesia pretty quick) and then dozed off again until maybe 4pm. Rest of the day was liquid diet and a lot of people coming to check drains and surgery site. Everyoneâ€™s been super friendly and accommodating.

What was your timeline from scheduling a consult to surgery? I know she is somewhat booked up, just curious what itâ€™s like now.

I think I first called to book a consult in August of 2020, for a consult date in March 2021. I didnâ€™t actually schedule the surgery until August of 2021, and I couldâ€™ve had a slightly earlier date, but it was going to work better with my work schedule if I could take time off in winter, so I waited a few extra months. If I had taken the quickest route, total time from booking consult to surgery day wouldâ€™ve been ~1.5 years. Her wait times have definitely gone up though. I think I just read about someone booking their consult for august of 2023, so probably looking at a bit over 2 years for the whole process at this point.

Thank you! I havenâ€™t had a good look yet due to the gauze and not being able to really sit up. But my roommate says itâ€™s looking good.
