Did you do electrolysis at her clinic? What did you think of the electrologist there? Good tech? Good injections? Complete clearings? I just mailed in my application to her office. I’m just worried it’ll take me years... I unfortunately come from a family of very hairy women.

I did the electrolysis local to where I live. And it was quite extensive. The truth is, that few admit (including me - my wife doesn&#39;t even know) is that despite all that and the folicle scraping they do in the OR, I have exactly 4 hairs that grew post-op. Didn&#39;t notice till the 6 month mark. But I am able to grab hold of them and pluck them out. And I&#39;ve only had to do that twice. So twice a year basically. Embarrassing if anyone knew but all women have embarrassing bodily secrets, right? Its disappointing after all the pain and expense of electrolysis but if I waited another 6 months to a year to wait for regrowth, I would have been very unhappy waiting and if I waited a whole year - I&#39;d be delayed again by stupid covid so I am OK with it.

What was your pre-srs electrolysis schedule like?  Frequency/hours?  How many continuous months did you do?

I only did 6 months - right up until 28 days (4 weeks) before surgery. I went 3 or 4 times a week for 3 or 4 hours a session. Not ideal i guess but it is what it is. I didn&#39;t want to space it out over a year and then wait another 6 months for potential regrowth. Technically that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do I guess but after waiting my whole life, I had waited long enough. But that&#39;s the reason I probably still have those 4 stragglers. Still, I don&#39;t regret it. I just wish it weren&#39;t so damn expensive

<p>
Just to be clear could this be an average week for you?
</p>
<p>
Monday - 3 hours
</p>
<p>
Tuesday - 4 hours
</p>
<p>
Wednesday - break
</p>
<p>
Thursday - 4 hours
</p>
<p>
Friday - 3 hours
</p>
<p>
Edit: also:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Just curious were those 3-4 hours sessions with a lidocaine injection or just topical?
</li>
<li>
How many months did it take where a session would clear in the session?
</li>
<li>
At the end where you still using 3-4 hours or was it less time?
</li>
</ul>

The days of the week varied by availability but it wasn&#39;t uncommon to go three days in a row with no break. It was pretty brutal because it was after work for me and we would be there until 9, 10 or 11 at night. On the plus side we actually became friends and we now socialize outside of that environment (obviously).
</p>
<p>
I used a prescription topical lidocaine. Most times it worked great and sometimes it felt like I didn&#39;t use it at all
</p>
<p>
I actually started going for only 2 or 3 hours but as we got closer and closer to the date we increased it to three and four hours. She often went even beyond that and didn&#39;t charge me for it. If she was in the middle of clearing a particular area, she just wanted to finish but didn&#39;t see the point in charging me for partial hours. She was super nice like that. Officially I had a hundred hours. Unofficially it was probably an additional 10 or so.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure I ever had the entire area clear at one time. And according to the PA, that&#39;s the reason I ended up with a couple of stragglers. She said when you go as frequently as I did it&#39;s hard for the technician to know what is new growth and what has not been cleared at all yet

FYSA, just to provide the prospective of another of McGinn&#39;s patients.  I went with her for a variety of reasons, one of which: no electrolysis which from my speaking with others, can become unspeakably painful. Sooo... no electrolysis for me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be two years post op in August and no hairs have come back.

Really? You put all your faith in the follicle scraping and it worked out? I&#39;m really glad to hear that!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m gonna give it my best college try anyway. I&#39;ve got a year minimum to wait for my employee leave allowance to reset. I used it all for FFS recovery. New Hope is only about an hour from where I live in NYC. So I might as well make the best of my wait.

Yes, to be fair I&#39;m Irish with very fair hair, pretty white skin and little body hair (except of course for that horrible shit we sometimes feel on our faces). I feel super lucky and I&#39;m not sure I could have dealt with the pain of electrolysis &#34;down there&#34; after having dealt with it on my relatively insensitive face.

Great question!  Yes, early on I was kinda concerned about the incision scars. After my 6 week follow up I started using silicone scar strips and continued that for maybe a couple months and then just kinda stopped.
</p>
<p>
They diminished quite a lot. Nothing like I thought they would be. She&#39;s smart about where she does the incision and unless you favor a totally smooth shaven look, I don&#39;t really notice them now. Would someone notice if they were going down on me? Well at that extreme closeness, maybe but the thing to remember is - it really does take about a year to know what the &#34;final appearance&#34; will be - even for me and I am a super fast healer.

Honestly, the day after surgery (1 year ago today), my wife peeked under the dressing and was already impressed. Which is pretty amazing because she was super skeptical on how the aesthetics would be and also - it was only the first full day. I was still a swollen mess - yet it already looked good according to her. I was high on morphine so I just smiled and nodded back off to la la land

How is your depth?  What did you start out at and how much did you lose?  Did you use any topical Testosterone?

I also did not use any topical T though she offered. I was scared of the stuff and having dealt with it for so many decades.  I don&#39;t have the libido I did pre transition and have much less longing for sex in general but after about a year the area became appropriately sensitive enough.

I am
<strong>
so
</strong>
deep lol. Even at my consultation, McGinn said,
<em>
Oh you are gonna have no problem with depth!
</em>
, which I think had more to do with the scrotal donor material than anything else but I had plenty of both for &#34;donation&#34; lol.
</p>
<p>
So my depth is officially 6.25 inches, and I&#39;ve not lost any of that depth. I&#39;ve never had a problem dilating. I only have to do it once a week now but thats only because I never once missed a dilation for a year. I was religious about making sure I did everything they told me to and it paid off. Dilating just becomes a chore after a while - though for me it was never painful.
</p>
<p>
They offered T but I declined. My libido is fine. Orgasms are absolutely fantastic and afterwards -
<strong>
no dysphoria!!
</strong>
.

Where you longer than average before?
</p>
<p>
On T, I wasn&#39;t talking about a T injection, but a topical testosterone that I guess you would apply with a dilator to help with any skin atrophy/tightness issues inside the vagaina.  But sounds like you didn&#39;t do that either.

I understood what you were saying about T. They offered a prescription for T gel but I declined. For several reasons. You can only get it at a compounding pharmacy. They can&#39;t guarantee no secondary sex characteristics side effects from testosterone (facial hair, hair in general, body odor, etc... I also know a cis woman who survived breast cancer. Her libido tanked afterwards. Her doctor gave her a small dose of T gel. It works for her libido but she noticed facial hair and that&#39;s how she and I got on the topic of electrolysis) And, isn&#39;t that the whole reason I transitioned? To be rid of those secondary sex characteristics? They said there is a risk of that if it&#39;s not compounded correctly. Also, you have to deal with a compounding pharmacy. Also, and most importantly, I wasn&#39;t about to reintroduce T to my system without giving myself at least a full year to see what my body could do all by itself.

So did you get reimbursed your out of network amount? I just did the same thing for FFS and I’m currently dealing with insurance who filed it wrong. I paid $37k and they sent me a check for $2k rather than 90%.

My insurance was utterly useless. All they did was apply their so-called &#34;allowable amount for vaginoplasty&#34; ($2800) towards my out-of-netwprk deductible. They did pay on the hospital bill because the hospital is in-network. And the hospital - before insurance - was $211k!!! I ended up paying almost $2600 for the hospital after insurance. Then still had to pay for anesthesia which is always separate. Also have pay for a place to stay (Gaia), plus food and gas... its insanely expensive but I had the money put aside. It&#39;s all gone now of course. Honestly if I weren&#39;t in my 40&#39;s with money put aside, I would have had to go to someone in-network - and on the east coast there is no one I trust and I had no desire to travel via plane to California to see Marci Bowers (or be on her years-long wait list) and I was sure as heck not leaving the country (Suporn or Brassard).
</p>
<p>
And now covid... let&#39;s just say all that money could really help right now but I had to spend it on GCS. I don&#39;t regret it at all but its absurd the amount of money I had to spend

Oh no! That’s pretty much what my insurance company did. It’s totally not live-laugh-love of them to say they cover something, then just throw you a couple thousand dollars afterwards to check the “trans coverage” box. So I did some digging before just accepting that I got ripped off, and it turns out they filed it all wrong. I think I may still look into going with McGinn, but now I know all the questions to ask the insurance representatives.
</p>
<p>
Yeah for my FFS, the OR and overnight stay at St. Francis Memorial in SF was $1.325 million before insurance. They made me sign all that at 6AM right before undressing for surgery, and it had me freaking out.

Do they allow you to pay through installments or any kind of payment plan or is it all up front at the beginning?

It was a down payment and then the rest must be paid before surgery. You could try to use something like Care Credit to pay over installments. I&#39;m pretty sure McGinn accepts it. But you have to apply for the credit line to Care Credit. I used it for my rhinoplasty and the surgeon had the forms right there in their office.

How long post op did you start to feel “normal”, and were able to return to your routine?
</p>
<p>
Did you stay at Gaia house, or somewhere else?

I stayed at Gaia and would highly recommend. Its a very peaceful and quiet place to recover. Bill and Ron are really lovely gentlemen and it&#39;s nice to be somewhere supportive. There was another girl there when I was and she needed some moral support and I was happy to provide it. Also met lovely trans women at each of my follow-up stays.
</p>
<p>
At 5 and a half weeks I went to my local pride festival. I would say that was when I first felt totally normal. I walked quite a bit and sat on wooden benches, etc... and i felt no discomfort sitting, standing walking, etc...  Full disclosure though: I am a famously fast healer.

hi!  I have my initial consult in 2 weeks (eep!) and have been looking at how to get my budget in order.  Did Gaia give you a discount at all for being a patient of Dr. McGinn?  The coordinator thought they did but didn&#39;t have an exact number off hand.  Also, thank you SO much for doing this!  I can&#39;t tell you how helpful it is to keep having people support this subreddit with up to date content.  &lt;3

Gaia does give a discount! Forget how much. You also don&#39;t need to pay for the reservation as far ahead of time (but still reserve it!!)

First contact was September 2018. Phone consult was December 2018. In-person consult was February 2019. Surgery was April 2019. So basically 7-8 months from initial contact to actual surgery date.

Honestly it was nothing like I anticipated! I had hernia surgery a number of years ago. That is still the single most painful surgery I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;ve had a lot of them in my time. That hernia pain was a very internal pain. I expected GCS surgery pain to be very internal also. But it was not. Any pain and discomfort was all along my labia and vulva in general. It was never horrendous. But pain is a personal thing. Another girl staying at Gaia had a very different experience than I did. She was in a lot of pain and was quite vocal about it. They took me off morphine on the morning of the 3rd day I&#39;m pretty sure. Switched me over to a liquid Tylenol IV drip and oral Hydrocodone.
</p>
<p>
Once I was discharged, I only needed a couple of painkillers here and there to sleep. By the time I was home I still had quite a few of them left over. I tried not to take them unless I really needed them to sleep

Another perspective on pain.  The most painful bit of the experience was, by far, the stay in the bariatric clinic they used to use for the operations.  The bed was brutal- the pain in my back unbearable and I even had a relapse in her office which left me withing on the floor unable to do anything else.  None of this had anything to do with the procedure itself- just a result of laying on my back on a terrible mattress for 72 hours.
</p>
<p>
I had very moderate pain from the procedure, in fact took none of the post operative meds. No pain meds at all.

What was the day of the surgery like?  Pre-op meeting with Dr. McGinn?  Any final testing and waiting at the hospital?  Or did you essentially get right into the OR?
</p>
<p>
How many full clearings of electrolysis did you have done?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to do this.

See another answer that I supplied in one of my comment replies here regarding electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
The surgery was like any surgery. Once they administer the anesthetic you are out like a light and the next moment you are waking up in the recovery room.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s start with the pre-op meeting. It went great. I had a lot of questions written down and she answered every one of them. She actually was impressed at the questions that I asked. People say that she is standoffish but that&#39;s not the impression that my wife or I got from her. She comes across as confident and smart. Those are definitely qualities you want. I do not understand the negative reviews she gets when it comes to her demeanor. She&#39;s a surgeon. She&#39;s very matter-of-fact. And I appreciate that. I don&#39;t want things sugar-coated you know? I want straight, honest answers and she delivered.
</p>
<p>
The day before surgery I did have to go to her office to fill out some final consent forms. No additional testing or anything like that. I met with her and her PA. I was going to get BA done at the same time and we kind of had a final consult about that because mine would have been a special case due to some prior medical issues. Not only was Dr McGinn willing to address that for me, she was the
<em>
only
</em>
surgeon willing to address that for me. She even called me one evening  around 9 p.m., I assume from her own home  to review that particular scenario with me. She said that she knew it really bothered me and she really wanted to help. That&#39;s the impression I get from her. Someone who really wants to help you. But the morning of the surgery I chickened out of getting the BA done. I ended up spending that money on a rhinoplasty and I don&#39;t regret it because I had decent breast growth to begin with.
</p>
<p>
The morning of surgery,  everything went really fast. We got there and checked in and no sooner than we sat down there in the lobby, and they called my name and I went into triage where I stripped down to a Johnny coat. Once I was settled, different nurses came in and took my vitals and asked questions and give me a heater for my Johnny coat, gave me a shot in my leg and some kind of patch behind my ear for something to do with nausea, and really just were very attentive. I really felt like I was very well looked after. Some point while I was in that room they let my wife come in to see me one last time before I went to the OR. I got a little emotional while I was being wheeled to the OR but I don&#39;t remember anything after being wheeled in. I think they could see I was a little emotional and they put me right out.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re welcome. It is my pleasure to pay it forward!

Would you be willing to share what those questions were?  I&#39;ve got my own list going but I&#39;m always interested in seeing what other folks have concerns about/are interested in.  If not publicly that&#39;s totally cool.

I&#39;ve read that some people go back for a follow-up or revision to get the final look that they want.  It seems like typically that&#39;s almost necessary for most people.
</p>
<p>
I have concerns myself about looking natural down there and it feels like a revision is typically what people do.
</p>
<p>
That said I&#39;ve never actually asked someone.  McGinn is on the top of my list along with Avanessian so I&#39;m curious about your result and if you&#39;ve been happy aesthetically and if you felt the need for a revision or not.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for doing this!

Okay so at my 6-month follow-up I did have a question about the labia minora. Dr McGinn was meeting with personnel from the hospital so I couldn&#39;t see her. They said I could come back on any Monday to meet with her but I was in no rush so I scheduled a 1-year follow-up for May 4th. But with covid ruining everything for everyone, they called and offered a phone appointment preceded by me sending pictures. But that&#39;s not going to cut it for what I wanted to discuss so I am waiting until this all blows over to have an in-person appointment with her. Honestly, aesthetically, I think it&#39;s fantastic. If I want to be super nitpicky I could say that the labia minora could be a little puffier. I also feel like, even though it doesn&#39;t appear that way when you look at it, it does feel like my clitoris is a bit larger than a cis clitoris. Not the visible portion mind you, but what you can feel underneath the clitoral hood. I also still have some numbness in my labia. Those are the things I want to discuss with her in person. I don&#39;t know that I would have a revision done. If I were single, maybe I would take advantage of their offer of basically a fat transfer from your thigh or elsewhere to the labia to make them a bit puffier looking. But since I&#39;m not single and dating I&#39;m not worried about it but I still want to have that final consult with her once in-person meetings are doable again.
</p>
<p>
And you are quite welcome!

My concern comes largely from being single and a lesbian.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to be dishonest, any partner that I have will know that I&#39;m transgender for sure.
</p>
<p>
I still want a natural look, there&#39;s insecurity that not having that will affect a potential partner being okay with me.  I know that&#39;s super insecure but feelings are what they are.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the detailed response

Honestly the only results I&#39;ve ever seen that I thought looked great were from McGinn or some of the Thai surgeons. No offense to anyone here who has had surgery with someone else, but a lot of the pictures I&#39;ve seen just do not look good to me. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s technique or experience or what but McGinn really does nail the look of a cis vulva

I&#39;m not OP, but another translesbian in a relationship. My parter (at 1+ years postop) says the business seems completely OEM.  I keep things very neat so there&#39;s no hair to disguise the outcome and it looks wonderful to her. I have very delicate, near porcelain skis and any scars there are aren&#39;t super obvious to me.  I think she does a nice job of availing herself of the natural folds and contours to minimise any visible scarring.

Can I ask how close you live to her office? That’s probably the one headache that dissuades me- I’m far away from PA/NJ, so going to her office a bunch for follow ups would get pricey with flights and hotels.

Pain depends on the individual but for me it wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought it was going to be. They manage your pain with morphine - you have a button you can press as you need it but there is a built-in governor on how often you can  press it. It lights up green and you know you can press it again. You have that for the day of surgery and the next day. On the 3rd day at some point they will hang a bag of liquid tylenol instead and give you oral Hydrocodone every 5 or 6 hours. All in all, your pain is managed quite well

I guess what I mean is that I&#39;d be flying in for surgery and it would be really inconvenient to have to travel back there often for follow-ups

You&#39;d be there in the New Hope area for about 2 weeks. Arrived on Sunday night. Final pre-op appt Monday. My surgery was on a Tuesday. 1st follow up was 6 days later and then again 3 days after that (so 11 days total - leaving for home on the morning of the 12th day). I was there (away from home) the whole time. After the final appt, I then I went home and didn&#39;t have to return until the 6 week mark and then the 6 month mark. But yes - you will have travel back there for those 6 week and 6 month follow-ups - as inconvenient as that may be. You just have to plan for it

Thinking about getting ftm surgery with her at some point, so was just wondering about onsite accommodation/hotels in the area and how that is worked out. Anything I should know or that you would have liked to have had known?

No to both. The only issue I had briefly was an odor from a particular brand of lube. It just reacted poorly with my own pH. I switched back to Surgilube and it solved that problem.

When you dilate is the skin at the entrance to your vagina below the dilator (closest to your asshole) very taught?
</p>
<p>
Or more to the point, if you have had sex with a guy does he complain the the skin right there is like a rubber band pulling tightly?

Haha okay, removing the guy from the picture when you stick two fingers in do you find that the skin pulls very tightly?
</p>
<p>
Or to dilate do you have to move the lower skin out of the way?  Almost angle under it and then around to enter?  Or is the entrance fully exposed?

I mean, its like any vaginal opening I guess? The labia cover it. But if I spread my legs wide, they will part slightly. I&#39;ve never had to consciously think -
<em>
Let me move my labia out of the way
</em>
or anything. I&#39;ve never noticed what you are describing. When I dilate, I don&#39;t have to move anything out of the way and don&#39;t feel like its obstructed. I&#39;ve been with other cis women. I don&#39;t think I am doing anything differently than they are...

Thanks, yeah not talking about the labia, but the fact that I am coming off as confusing is also good.  Seen some results where this was very much a case and it would be obvious.  Glad that was not the case for you.

Hello, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? How is your vaginal depth? Would you like to have a revision surgery to improve aesthetics? How was the stay at New Hope?  What was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare like? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Hi! All but 2 of your questions have been answered here in the comments. I&#39;ll answer the rest though:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Experience, location, complication rate (incredibly low) and the fact that she is trans herself.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare like?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Very attentive. Not McGinn herself, mind you but her PA&#39;s. Can email them pictures and get feedback, etc...
</p>
<p>
If you have more specific questions about any of this, please let me know. I&#39;d be happy to elaborate on any of it!

Recovery, for me - a famously quick healer - was not all as bad as I thought it would be. Not even close.
</p>
<p>
The greatest joy is two things - the simple daily act of getting dressed. I don&#39;t have to make my clothing choices based on how I can hide my groin area and I don&#39;t have to tuck. That is such a huge weight of anxiety off my mind. The second thing is sex and orgasms. There is no dysphoria! It&#39;s so lovely to just enjoy the experience with no aftereffects of dysphoria or depression.
</p>
