Is it out of the question for me to get a vulva with a labia minora and clitoral hood (that actually covers my clit and can be peeled back) it I have been circumcised? Will part of my labia always look dirty (the way my penis does now) because of where my scar was?
</p>
<p>
More specifically, if the majority of my frenulum was removed is it possible to get a frenulum of the clitoris as well as a fourchette?
</p>
<p>
The appearance of my vulva and having a somewhat lippier look are my primary concerns with surgery, and I&#39;m willing to go zero/minimal depth if need be. But I want to be able to prepare myself to look into other options if these aren&#39;t realistically attainable.

Dr. Chettawut gave me a very nice aesthetic and clitoral hood and I was 4 inches and circumcised lol. Thai doctors give the best results if you are not well endowed imo.

No problem! You can DM me if you have any questions. Overall, I think the way it looks is the best it could possibly look without being born cis. There are many posts regarding Chettawut you can find on here and Susan&#39;s.

If you are circumcised then the surgeon will be looking to use part of your scrotum. They will recommend electrolysis as the outside of your scrotum will be used for the inside... although if itâ€™s very cold your man might appreciate a penis muff full of hair to keep it warmðŸ˜‚

Haha, here&#39;s hoping that I won&#39;t have a vag full of hairðŸ¤® that&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;m still debating getting a second surgery to give me depth since the visual thing is more important to me. Sex is somewhat painful, and most touch is too, so if I can&#39;t have sex with it I shouldn&#39;t be too heartbroken. My biggest concerns are that I don&#39;t have enough mucosal and connective tissue for the vulva&#39;s features that I appreciate.

To be honest the only one who can advise is your chosen surgeon.  They will have a good look at the available material to work on.... and then advise. Xx

That makes sense to me, so far the only surgeon&#39;s that share my aesthetic appreciations are in Thailand (I don&#39;t know of any western surgeons that go for natural appearances over labiaplasty looks, with revisions later).

Suporn wrote a paper last year on aesthetics and I think he discusses circumcision.

From what I can find online the surgeons (Bowers and Ting?) at Mt Sinai have a different aesthetic appreciation than I do, so it doesn&#39;t seem like my best option right now. I was planning on asking them about it in my email to them, but I&#39;m not holding my breath as Bowers seems to recommend a two stage surgery for aesthetics, idk about zero-depth though. However, it&#39;d be nice if I could stay state side for the surgery.
