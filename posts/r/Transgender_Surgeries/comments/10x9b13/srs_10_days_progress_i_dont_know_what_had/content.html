SRS 10 days progress. I don‚Äôt know what had happened. Was it wound dehiscence or some blisters from the stitches but it got better. The stitches were very hard and rigid

Honestly, I think it was just normal healing. You seemed to have a lot of anxiety and perhaps unrealistic expectations that you would be better in a few days. Obviously, you had some complications while still in Thailand so it‚Äôs normal that you would be especially stressed. Healing takes weeks and months, not something you get over in a long weekend. I never did see any of the wound separation you were so afraid of, after you left Thailand. I do think you had some mild inflammation from the stitches they put in for the repair. Everything else looks like normal healing, and I think you just had a lot of anxiety because your surgical team did not seem to prepare you. You can expect that things are going to be inflamed and red and irritated because that‚Äôs what surgery does. It will be a full year before things settle down completely.

Thanks üôè I freaked out because I saw so many results on here but not saw anybody getting blisters. I‚Äôm happy it got better. I trimmed the stitches that were popping out and it made things better

Some people get inflammation from stitches. I had something similar, but it will go away. Just be careful not to pull them out too early by accident.
