A follow up to my older thread.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/112h9rw/the_horrific_facial_feminization_surgery_by/">The horrific facial feminization surgery by Yanhee hospital
</a>
</p>
<p>
Thought I would share these after consulting with doctors for revision to hopefully fix the disastrous work of Dr. Suthat Koonnawarote in Yanhee hospital.
</p>
<p>
Just viewing these with them makes me more frustrated about how awfully wrong everything is.
</p>
<p>
1- You can see the doctor didn&#39;t do much on the forehead, except those random gaps in the middle. I think he was grinding my forehead with power tools. I don&#39;t feel the gaps, might be covered or could be scan&#39;s artifacts, shaving tracks?
<br>
2- Sinus remained untouched. Doctor most likely performed forehead type bs.
<br>
3- Hump still exist after Rhinoplasty.
<br>
4- Unknown random screw on the chin for god knows why. Doctors asking me why do I have that? I could feel the screw when I touch my chin but I thought it was the brackets.
</p>
<p>
This scan was done 6 months after the disaster FFS surgery.
<br>
By that time, I had jaw shaving revision, Rhinoplasty revision and chin revision (removing those brackets and screw).
</p>
<p>
Still need 3 more revisions, forehead, eyebrows, cheeks, ( I gave up on hairline, most likely can&#39;t be fixed.)Some hospital said they can&#39;t fix me and some offered revision of $ 12k to 15k for forehead only.
</p>
<p>
Still not losing hope.
<br>
Thank you for reading.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
On side note: The hospital is refusing to give me the operation note, when I asked for them after the surgery, their coordinator New, was stalling and making excuses, asking me when will I leave, I said 5 days and he told me it will take longer than that to get the report, I said how long a week? He said about that. I said ok I will extend my staying, then he said it might take longer than a week, then I said how long? A month? He said could be longer.
<br>
One of the doctors asked me for the report, so I sent an email to Yanhee, again asking for my report, they were stalling and after a month they sent to me a discharge from the hospital note, I told them I wanted the surgery report and they kept stalling again and sent a list of procedures I had report.
<br>
I could use these emails now to sue the hospital and as evidence, but I&#39;d rather saving my money to fix their mistakes.

That screw only being halfway in is crazy. I’ve seen to many bad results that I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go to a non-western foreign country with lax regulations for surgery. I went to Chett for SRS myself and I’m just relieved it turned out ok, definitely wouldn’t take that risk again. It’s so unfortunate that it’s the only option for many people cost wise.

This person did not have the knowledge to give you a PROPER type 3 sinus setback, to give you a natural and smooth feminine forehead contour. Shame on them for thinking a simple shave would suffice. Now you have to deal with revisions and complications due to his ineptitude. Shame on him. Hope it gets better for you love.

He preformed type &#34;bs, idk what to do&#34;, and had the nerve to tell me on the surgery follow up &#34;You just don&#39;t like the results&#34;
<br>
Not to mention I had to do revision for all his procedures except one, lip uplift.
<br>
That monster is not qualified to be doctor, more over, a surgeon.

My gosh girlie I&#39;m so sorry :(
</p>
<p>
What the hell did they do on your jaw? That looks like A LOT of bone was removed.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps worst case scenario, for a forehead revision, the anterior table could be rebuilt with a piece of your rib, as it&#39;s done sometimes with rhinoplasty revisions.

My jaw is actually fine after the revision, and in the CT scan which is after the revision.
<br>
When that awful doctor did the surgery on me, my jaw had sharp 90 degrees angle, looked so weird, whenever I open my mouth I look like those stretched 3D models.
<br>
That killed my mood for eating outside haha.
<br>
I&#39;m working on fixing myself, step by step...
<br>
Thank you ❤

Wow that screw in your chin 😳 also wanted to make sure you know the 3D renderings of CT scans are not always super accurate.  They are neat to look at and give you a broader picture of your scan, but they are not really diagnostic unless the technologist doing the rendering is super skilled and the scan is very high quality.  I&#39;m hopeful those weird forehead gaps on the 3D image are just from poor rendering. So sorry you are dealing with this.  I&#39;m really shocked by the screw sticking so far out of your poor chin 😢

That&#39;s what I thought first.
<br>
But the scan took multiple images from different angels and you can see the gaps in every one of them.
<br>
Still not entirely sure, could be bad rendering like you said.
<br>
Most doctors told me they can do revision to fix my forehead, hopefully, we can do something about it.
<br>
Thank you for the comment ❤

I can not find one doctor without some scary story.
<br>
The US cost is way out of my range and still not guaranteed.
<br>
South America feels like a war zone to me, idk why, I&#39;m really scared of stepping there and can&#39;t find much info or options in the wiki,  can you recommend any to me?
</p>
<p>
I feel lost and not sure who to go with, this is mostly my last chance, if it goes wrong it&#39;s over for me.

<p>
I contacted Dr.Chett 3 weeks ago about forehead revision and he asked 450,000 TBH forehead only, and suggested to do rhinoplasty to fix crocked nose.
<br>
I was in shock of his recommendation, because I already fixed my nose and doesn&#39;t look bad at all, from how it was.
</p>
<p>
This is picture of my nose (same one sent for consultation):
<a href="https://ibb.co/0Bfrz1t" rel="nofollow">https://ibb.co/0Bfrz1t
</a>
<br>
( Warning, high level of ugliness )
</p>
<p>
When I asked the contact, for the doctor to point or draw how exactly my nose is crocked, she said doctor says it&#39;s ok if you do not wish to fix it, he says crocked at the base and fix nostrils.
<br>
I scratched his name from my list after hearing this.
<br>
I mean, it&#39;s really hard to get nose perfectly asymmetric, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that bad to require another revision? Do you think it&#39;s that bad?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing doctors names, I&#39;ll be checking them out.
<br>
I appreciate your help *hugs*

Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s enough thick bones there.

It&#39;s actually matches the female&#39;s jaw line, if you Google it.

It was done in Kamol hospital.
<br>
Genioplasty, rhinoplasty and forehead type 3 revisions.
<br>
He did an amazing job despite the damage, the staff is extremely nice.
<br>
Compared to Yanhee&#39;s, the results were far better, the gap in skills is real.
</p>
<p>
Kamol hospital have international trans patients so the doctor knows how to approach and evaluate their patients differently which made me more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Extra info:
<br>
I consulted FacialTeam too, they were nice, I didn&#39;t like the doctor approach where he said they gonna make an incision at the very back of my scalp/skull for the revision, that means, high chances of my whole head going numb, also they&#39;re asking 13k per procedure and 6k hospital&#39;s fees. (45k total)
<br>
Either they think Trans people are born naturally rich or they&#39;re trying to cash on their desperation.
<br>
Dr.Kamol did revisions over the previous incisions and the total cost was around 15k.
</p>
<p>
Many Thailand&#39;s hospitals stopped doing FFS since my last visit.
<br>
Do intense researches and consult as many as you can, your views might be different than mine.

the screw is probably protruding on purpose, to mimic some advancement of the chin.

With half way screw?
<br>
There are implants, cements and probably more options I don&#39;t know about.
<br>
Can you imagine if I had an impact on the chin what would happen with that screw protruding like that?
<br>
I already removed it in the revision, and without it, my chin look much smoother and better.

<p>
If that truly was the case or doctor&#39;s excuse, then that would be a mechanic job not a doctor.
<br>
I refuse to accept that.
