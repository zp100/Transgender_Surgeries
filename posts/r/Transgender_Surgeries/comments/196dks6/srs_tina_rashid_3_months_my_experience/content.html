I‚Äôm going in for surgery the Friday after this one coming and your post has been super helpful. I really appreciate the positive attitude about even the difficult aspects. I‚Äôve saved this and will definitely be coming back during my recovery to re-read!

This is very useful, thank you for typing that up and sharing your experiences. It will especially help me organise my post-op care and supplies.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m due to see Tina Rashid at some indefinite point this year if I&#39;m lucky. I had my consultation with her team at St George&#39;s last September, but the GRS service has been suspended there so I&#39;m kind of in limbo. However, for similar reasons to you, she is absolutely the right choice for me. I can get 4 inches without hair renoval which might not be optimal, but it works for me (I&#39;m getting my downstairs lasered anyway, largely because I want to).
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s helpful to know you can sign a waiver if you don&#39;t want to halt your estrogen. That was worrying me because I have friends who got wound desisence because their dressings sweated off from menopausal symptoms. Not to mention, it contributes to a lot of the negative feelings you get post-op, so I&#39;m wary of going off it for more than one/two weeks.

This is really detailed, thank you so much for sharing your experience. My referral was recently sent to Parkside and I&#39;m just waiting for a consultation date.
</p>
<p>
I have a couple of questions. - Thinking about timelines, how long between GDNRSS sending your referral to Parkside, did it take for you to be offered a consultation and having it? - once you were released home during recovery, were you quite independent or are you living with someone who was helping top look after you? - how long did it take for you to be able to leave the house after getting home?

That&#39;s a long time to be waiting, you&#39;re a very patient woman. That makes sense, I have plans to have people around me for support but I&#39;m glad to hear your recovery has been fairly smooth. thank you again.

Super useful, I like you am choosing Ms Rashid over others like Rashid as it just fits me better - the surgeon being in my home country, people being able to easily visit etc, plus it being on the NHS. It just makes sense. It&#39;s very rare I hear negative things about her too, if at all!
</p>
<p>
How was the travel aspect for you - you mentioned driving and dealing with the M25/Wimbledon so presumably your method of transport was car? Did you have to stop a lot on the drive back home? How was comfort being in a car for an extended period so soon after surgery?
