<p>
This day last year I was just out of surgery. I really can&#39;t believe its been a year. Has absolutely flown past.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been reminiscing a lot this past few days about the whole journey so far. If I had to do it again, I would do nothing different - and I guess that&#39;s a fair recommendation.
</p>
<p>
My recovery was frankly easy compared to some stories I have read, and for this I shall be eternally grateful. I remain very happy with my result, but do hope that my scars further improve - particularly the white bits!
</p>
<p>
Activities wise, I was doing most of what I did before after like 3 months and everything by 6 months. This summer has seen bike rides back up to 100 miles (I dunna get numb nuts on a bike ride anymore - hurray!!). My main hobby is hill walking and i&#39;ve also done a 3 day river paddle+camping, and a 3 day packrafting hiking and camping trip into the wilds of Scotland. Suffice to say that surgery did has not stopped me doing any of the things I enjoy.
</p>
<p>
Dilations wise I am now once a week. I have definitely lost a little depth, but some of it was &#39;false depth&#39; due to swelling that has now gone down. Still I reckon I am 10mm down on the orange dilator and 5mm on the blue. Just got to stay on top of it to not loose more. I only douche after dilation eg weekly.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is now excellent, and all the numbness has gone. It does take rather longer to get there than before,  and failing to do the &#39;build up&#39; to get in the mood is like flogging a dead horse when it comes to the &#39;O&#39;! Not had any experiences with others - more&#39;s the pity!
</p>
<p>
Problems wise, After the river paddling/camping trip, I got a dose of BV (Bacterial Vaginosis) - at least its a woman&#39;s problem! Cured with the usual supository (CanesBalance). Not really washing, and festering in the same clothes in a drysuit in the sunshine led to this, but using Lubilu Lube which is full of glycerin did not help. I have since switched to &#39;Good Clean Love - Almost Naked lube&#39;. I had another bout of BV as well, likely from falling asleep with a pad after dilating. I also started taking probiotics though unsure whether this has helped. I&#39;ve learnt that fannies need fresh-air - if you keep them dank and sweaty then they will deffo start smelling!
</p>
<p>
Photo&#39;s wise, I took the dilation pix before shaving, and there are a couple directly after dilating - sorry about the hedgehog! Things are incredibly elastic down there in that regard so my vagina closes up pretty quick post dilation. I love by legs together view the most, scars hardly visible from the front, and no issues with randoms seeing my bits in that regard.
</p>
<p>
I dont think i&#39;ll ever get over how flat things are down there. After almost 52 years with an unwanted growth, its an utter joy to behold!
</p>
<p>
I guess I could be picky, but fannies are not meant to be clones of one-another - neither are they supposed to look like they are modeling for a porn mag - they are supposed to have character! Mines got loads of character, and I love her to bits!!
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if I will provide a further update in a year, I suspect its not of much value so this might be the last you hear from this account. I wont be deleting everything I put up though as hopefully its somehow useful to others.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I do a wee timeline of my recovery as my finale here...

What is your depth. How long does it take to get to full depth while dilating? Do you have to dilate before sex?

Not tried sex as yet, but I can get a dildo in there without dilating first! Depth is about 5.5&#34;, takes about 5 mins to get to depth with blue first then a couple mins with a larger dilator. That&#39;s if I have not dilated for a week.

Looks great and it&#39;s healed nicely. I wouldn&#39;t say no to a referral to Tina but since I only joined the wafting list in April 21 that will probably take 10.... million years....
</p>
<p>
Congrats on your vagina!

I still think my pre-op fitness played it&#39;s part in my quick simple recovery, but anyone can get complications and that will deffo set things back recovery wise. Impossible to predict! I watched alot of netflix that first month, and the dilation schedule is hard. Being mentally prepared for this is key. Watch the lard during recovery. I put on about 7KG!

Hello, amazing posts can I ask what depth you have? I have a similar pre-op size to you so think I’ll have a similar result.
