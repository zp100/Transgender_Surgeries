I will continue my written updates later. So far all it&#39;s good and recovering surprisingly fast. Last week i was dealing with terrible itch and irritation. Reaching to my belly and down to my knees with small hives. I started to stop applying topicals one by one. Stoped Bacitracin, then scar cream, then switch wipes, stopped wipes, and finally switch lube. Turns out that surgilube is not so good on long term. First week or 2 is okay since it&#39;s sterile but I highly recommend not using it. Today o started using Slippery stuff and it was a complete switch from itch to relieve. Redness is almost gone itch  dramatically decreased after the first dilation with new lube. Oh! I&#39;m on orange dilator too!

Surgilube contains chlorohexadine. It’s a powerful antiseptic and can/has caused rashes. Also I’d expect it would  mess up any chance of normal bacterial environment, though not something to worry about at this point.

Yup, i didn&#39;t do my homework on lube. Then found a great write up on dilation that had an awesome link to this article.

<p>
3 dilations later / one day and the rash is almost gone.

Congrats on surgery and the results.

Note: That doesn&#39;t apply to all of us. In 9 days, I will have been using it to dilate for 2 years without issue.

Thanks! Totally, the rash reaction only applies to some folks; however, it contains antiseptic that will prevent good bacteria to grow. So yes it works but not the best, also has a higher pH level. Not terrible be higher that natural. Also I found the consistency very thick, a tinner lube made for easier dilation.

Here is one link to a well written article but there is more.

I have a write up so just go to my profile. Honestly I think her good stories don&#39;t come out here enough.

Edit: Here&#39;s the link to the begging of the write up

I use healthcare plus lubricating jelly (bacteriostatic) because I can buy it for $5 at the pharmacy on my block, or as low as $2.50 in a case of 12 online.

I&#39;m a year and several months post op, I&#39;ve had zero discomfort using it, although I have to apply more than slippery stuff. Its probably pretty close to your surgical lube, it&#39;s the same lube that my gyne uses at her office when I go for granulation treatments.
</p>
<p>
Slippery stuff gave me a lot of irritation at 2-4 months, when I was using it 3x per day, but is probably the least painful for inserting the dilator. The plastic bottles are kind of annoying, the pump is great until the last 20% when it stops working and you have to tap it out, they also seem more wasteful.
</p>
<p>
Avoid any offshoot of a KY product like the plague, absolutely horrible.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Also ps your result is stunning :)

Thanks! I will definitely try that lube. When Bowers webpage said KY or surgilube I knew to go for surgilube. I will also be trying different lubes as i do not need sterile one. All my wounds have close as yesterday&#39;s check up with speculum!

I was like &#34;wow that looks so good but it&#39;s sad those scars are still there after all this time...&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then I actually read the title. This is only 4 weeks!?!?! 10/10
