Have just arrived home after the surgery from the London Voice and swallowing clinic with the surgery performed at the onewelbeck Centre and thought I would create a post just incase anyone was looking into this and was curious about the whole procedure. I had a glottoplasty which was fairly standard but the surgeon uses a laser to reduce the vocal folds before stitching them together with a suture. So far so good everything went perfect and other than trying so hard not to cough its been great. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask away and I will get to them when I can ðŸ˜Š I know that I&#39;m going to see the doctor again in 4 weeks for a checkup and the recovery is as follows: 1 week total voice rest, 1 week of one or two words and still plenty of rest and then the next 4 weeks of slowly building backup to a comfortable talking range but no increased volume or loud coughing or laughing still (that&#39;s gonna be the hard part with my wife ðŸ˜…) I really hope this post will help someone because I know something like this would be a massive help for me. If people want me to I can post an update in around 4 weeks with progress too ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
Update: Just had my first checkup appointment and everything is still as it should be. My vocal cords are a fair bit inflamed so this has caused the pitch to go up and down like crazy. At one point it was almost back to my starting range so that was pretty shocking to hear. I didn&#39;t really know that it could do that so I wanted to post that in here incase anyone gets it done in the future and it might help to stop them having a breakdown like I almost did ðŸ˜… still quite a weak and soft voice so will update again after 4 weeks ðŸ˜Š

Honestly, first time through it broke down after about 6 weeks. They redid it after 6 months and has been fine since. Voice has &#39;passed&#39; on the phone and in everyday life since. Really happy.

You just have to do your best. If you feel a lot of phlegm building up try and breathe it out. Good luck.

Thanks. I just booked mine with Mr Al Yaghchi for October. So would love to hear how your recovery goes.
</p>
<p>
Would you be willing to post before and after voice clips?

Good luck on your recovery ðŸ˜Šx

Thanks for sharing. I&#39;m looking into having this done soon. Can&#39;t wait to see your next update in a few days time.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if the doctor has a long waiting list at all?
