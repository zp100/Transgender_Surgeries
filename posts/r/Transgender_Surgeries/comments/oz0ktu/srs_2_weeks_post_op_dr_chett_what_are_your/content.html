I had a surgery with Dr. Chettawut 2 weeks ago. I don&#39;t know what to think about the results at the moment. I know, it&#39;s 2 weeks and it will heal in course of next months. I had no complications and dilatation goes well so far. Please, let me know your honest opinions. Thank you!

I had SRS with Chettawut 4 years ago. Your photos look normal for someone who is 2 weeks post op. I wouldn’t worry if the nurses are also saying everything is fine.

Looks good. Reminds me of when I received specific instructions not to spread the labia to take photographs, or share them online :) Labia is looking very supple and well hydrated.
</p>
<p>
I definitely had more swelling at that point in time.

:-) yes, I was contemplating if I shall take pictures or not, but then nurses took pictures for doctor and nothing hurted so I decided to take just few pictures for myself so I can see progress with time. For the swelling, I try to drink as much water as possible and I also eat food rich in proteins. Also, I take vitamins and supplement called GelaVis, which helps with healing. It helps to wear thight panties made of 100% cotton. They make pressure and help with swelling. When in shower, I use Lactacyd shower gel for intimate parts to balance pH and it has also antibacterial properties.

The nurses refused to let me take photos/videos and Dr Chettawut refused to send me my before and after photos. I’m curious why that is

My impression was that he is wary of people posting negative results. Even if 19 people post good results and 1 post about something unfortunate, I suppose the attention will always be on the result that wasn&#39;t so good. Just guessing. Control what people see. It&#39;s kind of the norm in Thailand. If I worked in the office I would be looking at this subreddit and making educated guesses as to who posts what.
</p>
<p>
Welp, was motivated to have another look at my own vulva - looks normal I think. Labia majora are still pretty flappy and big. Hope they get a lot smaller.  I kind of want to take pictures of it but would have to make a throwaway.

Your still quiet early, just give it time and the skin will tighten up over time. He’s an amazing surgeon and from what i’ve seen his results seem to be quiet consistent.
</p>
<p>
Im surprised that OP doesn’t have much swelling at all, I had tons of swelling and it took a month for mine to look like hers at 2 weeks. Im surprised at how fast her stitches have started to dissolve at 2 weeks, unless it’s just excess threat sticking out

Good to hear. I can walk around fine, sit without much discomfort, just puzzled by the size and depth of the outer lips. Like a clam.

<p>
Yes, she definitely appears to have little swelling. Looking good, SummerSnowflakeRebel.

How was it getting into Thailand? How was quarantine? Is there any news if the country is going to shut down? I am currently in the process of getting things in order for Dr. Chet.

Hi, you can get to Thailand via 45 days of stay without visa. Check if your country is eligible for this. After arrival you go to ASQ hotel - the quarantine hotel for 14 days. Yes, it&#39;s annoying, but they take care of you. You book the ASQ hotel and all is incluided - 3 times a day meal and 3x PCR tests. You can&#39;t leave the room so Netflix is handy, e-book reader etc. The day you leave quarantine you have usually appointment with Chett. The situation in Thailand is not good as the pandemic is peaking here. It&#39;s better to be vaccinated before coming here for your own safety, but it&#39;s not mandatory here. I don&#39;t think Thailand will shut down as they have tourist programs for Phuket and other places via sandbox scheme. International flights work normally, domestic flights are suspended. You can not do many activities here in Bangkok as it&#39;s under lockdown, but you can do grocery or you can go to park. Most shops are closed as well as tourist attractions. It&#39;s expected, that in few next monts the situation will be the same or worst. It will get better with vaccination of local population. You don&#39;t go here for the vacation, but for the surgery anyways so think about it this way. I take it as such even thought I would love to see more from Thailand than hotel and hospital, but not this time because of the situation.
