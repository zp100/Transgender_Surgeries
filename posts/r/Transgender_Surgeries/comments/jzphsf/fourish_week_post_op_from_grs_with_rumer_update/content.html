Actually you know what I&#39;m not going to be polite.
</p>
<p>
Hey maybe the reason why nobody talks about having a positive experience with Rumer is because literally every time they try to there&#39;s an army of people telling them that she&#39;s a butcher and that they&#39;ve been butchered and that they&#39;re wrong. It sucks! Okay it sucks! The hate for her is a meme, she&#39;s obviously not that bad if she&#39;s still regularly doing good work and is still getting ~400 patients a year

Well, not for me or the three other people I know who&#39;ve gone to her at least (I live in Philly hence us all going to the same surgeon).

Yes I respect that but to many she is. Ask yourself this how many botched surgeries does one doctor need to have before they&#39;re called a butcher? Or this analogy, if a man rapes 4 women last year and this same man didn&#39;t rape you does that make him not a rapist? Point is if the surgeon has botched more than one then they are a butcher.

Literally every surgeon has a complication rate lmao? They&#39;re human. The thing to judge is how high is that rate (WPATH states that Rumers is low) and how they respond (from what I&#39;ve seen, she responds well).
</p>
<p>
Comparing a normal part of life, that people are unable to be perfect and that things happen, to rape is bizarre. Raping is not a normal unavoidable aspect of being a man. Hopefully you don&#39;t actually think that it is

Being botched is not a complication. It is negligence and malpractice related to incompetence and lack of interest to follow set standards. Complications are few and far between and often easily fixable i.e infection, hematoma etc. Botched surgeries are often debilitating and permanent. Anyway, no one cares about this doctor. No amount of promotion or reviews will rinse her bloodied hands of the trans lives she ruined.

I appreciate you giving your review, and I&#39;m pleased to hear that she has treated you better than she did with me. It seems like all the negative press she has received in the last few months has pushed her to give better results for her patients.
</p>
<p>
forgive me if this seems presumptuous, but I suspect they are asking you to give reviews wherever you can. they did much the same with me. However, at 4 weeks you still wont have a good idea of what her work will look like long term. I suggest waiting till you get to the 4 month mark before giving a full review of her work. by then your body will have adjusted, most of the necrosis will be played out, the swelling will be less of an issue, and the euphoria of having will have subsided a bit. In the meantime is suggest doing 2 things: compare your results to that of other
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa#wiki_kathy_lynn_rumer" rel="nofollow">Rumer clients
</a>
and the works of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa" rel="nofollow">other surgeons
</a>
. Secondly, and I&#39;m sorry if this causes dysphoria, be honest with yourself and how you feel about others seeing (or you sharing) that part of you.
</p>
<p>
I really do wish you well and hope you receive everything from Rumer to give you the results you want.

That is a weird thing to suspect lol. I was just happy, excited, and bored so I felt like posting. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve quickly learned that you&#39;re not supposed to say positive things about Rumer so I won&#39;t post again.
</p>
<p>
Also this is an old post, I&#39;m about three or so months post op now. Maybe not the four months you prescribed but the swelling is gone and life&#39;s back to normal so maybe close enough. And yeah I&#39;m still pleased as punch. The necrosis ended up being a lot less than I first thought so it&#39;s not really all that noticable and that was my only major complaint really. I wish the inner labia was larger and I&#39;ve gotta bend forward a little bit when I pee since the urethra is angled weird but eh I can live with that.
</p>
<p>
The necrosis is like, I&#39;m missing 1/4th of one of my outer labia which isn&#39;t great but it&#39;s not the end of the world. The other outer labia filled out if that makes sense so it&#39;s not apparent that any tissue was lost on that side. Maybe that&#39;ll happen to the other one too! We&#39;ll see
</p>
<p>
As to the &#34;sharing that part of you&#34; part; I&#39;ve had sex a few times now and haven&#39;t had any issues (I&#39;m gay hence not having to wait the full four months before sex). I&#39;m not embarrassed by how it looks and it works fine. Idk I guess I just got lucky. It looks close enough to cis for me and works well.
</p>
<p>
I compaired my results to previous Rumer patients as you asked and it looks like an entirely different surgeon lol. Idk my results aren&#39;t perfect but they&#39;re nowhere near what those people got. Lucky me I guess haha. Maybe she just phones it in sometimes, or has off days, or she listened to the criticism, or hell maybe the surgeon shadowing her rn was the one who actually did my surgery and she just instructed, who knows/who cares

glad your happy with what you got...have fun with her.
</p>
<p>
thanks for laughing at my body (yes, those are my pictures) and affirming how horrible my results were. To the point were you, a trans woman and a fellow patient of Dr. Rumer, would be repulsed by seeing what she left me with.

Oh sorry I wasn&#39;t laughing you and I wasn&#39;t talking about your link. I didn&#39;t even click on it because I already am aware of Rumer&#39;s reputation and didn&#39;t really care to see another one. Sorry I would&#39;ve phrased things better had I known it was a link to your post

I feel the need to post because all I see is butchered this and butchered that and at my two week mark (I had surgery with Dr. Kathy Rumer 09/23/2020) when I was having some major wound dehiscence, I was truly scared but let alone everything did heal properly  as there office coached me though everything. I past the two month mark at the end of November and I have had issues with depth, near week two I was having a really hard time with dilation and was down to first dot but i have gain back nearly 4 dots back through the means of different creams so that I&#39;m at the second to last dot. Iv had several in person visits through concerns of mine and have had a good experience with office staff in person and on the phone or email. So I have to agree with  antique_discussion_2 in regards that I dont necessarily feel botched and feel well taken care of. Post op results are looking great and I have full sensation especially my clitoris.

You had a better experience than I did. she gaslit me at each of our appointments then when i suggested I needed a revision she flat out told me she does not do revisions and canceled my. I felt so ugly and ashamed of what she left me with that i really did contemplate suicide.
</p>
<p>
This is why she has the reputation she does. Some people who have gone to her have been botched or they are friends of those that have been botched by her.  they see the heartache and they know they pain of feeling mutilated by her.
</p>
<p>
Please don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m grateful you have been treated well, but I wonder if that is because your results came out better than
