She&#39;s newer to the field. I met with her and didn&#39;t get the best of vibes in terms of her competency. I suspect she is average but idk for sure. That&#39;s a guess. This was over a year ago.  Since you are looking in the Philadelphia area, I also recommend meeting with the Temple University team (Dr Douglass and Hamidian).

Avoid Dr Rose. I cannot go into details as I am still having to deal with her. She is to busy to properly care for her patients. After care is terrible. She is too widespread on procedures. Ffs, vaginoplasty, top surgeries, phalloplasty‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry but no. She is too new. I have nothing it regrets going to her. I should have waited for Douglass in Philly or RBL in NY. I cannot stress enough, for vaginoplasty avoid her like the plague. At this point with how busy she is I would avoid her for anything. She is taking on more than she ethically should and her patient care is suffering as a result. Her attitude has changed over the last year as well. I can‚Äôt tell you what to do, but I regret my decision 100%. I cannot got into specifics because I don‚Äôt want to be identifiable to her. I wish I had listened to the one person I had spoke with that saw her and told me to stay away. I know some people have unique experiences but try to find a positive vaginoplasty review on her. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I live in Philly and I had zero depth with Dr. K. Ashley Brandt at Reading Hospital in June. My preop, op, and postop experiences have been top-notch and I am happy with the results. She is kind and warm and spent tons of time with me each time I had an appointment. There&#39;s not much on Dr. Brandt here but seek out what has been posted, her results are really good. And of course, she doesn&#39;t only do zero depth, going with that version was my choice. And I recommend everyone follow her on Instagram. She&#39;s queer like us, super intelligent, fun and fiercely defends all of our rights. Good luck, OP!
