Hi there, I recently had FFS with Dr Richard Fakin in Pfäffikon. I am very happy with the results and I wanted to share some details.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR : I wanted to diminish the male traits and increase / make stand out more the feminine ones. &#34;in between&#34; ideally. I had chin contouring, lip lift, blepharoplasty, brow bone reduction =
<strong>
very
</strong>
satisfied, no complications, I intend to do something more with him in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Long version follows (probably TMI, and sorry for the syntax):
</p>
<p>
I heard of him first via my GP, then I met a girl who was a patient of him a few years ago and had a positive experience.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks later I found his name here, mentioned in a few unfavourable but somewhat unspecific comments, plus a couple of positive ones. I was unable to find more details about the blurry ones and I admit I was now perplexed – but the photos and videos on his website looked good. I thus decided to at least talk to him and see if/what/how.
</p>
<p>
I wrote an e-mail and had an exchange with his assistant, the wonderful Sereina in Zürich. We scheduled a videoconf appointment but I had a problem with the video feed and he couldn&#39;t see me. Nevertheless we had a nice conversation, he was affable, explained things and answered questions (btw he speaks at least 4 languages and we could talk in my native language, super comfortable for me). Five weeks later I went to Zürich in order for him to take a look at me and further discuss what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
It was nice to meet them both, we had all the time and nobody was in a hurry. I told Dr Fakin what I had in mind and where to intervene (adam&#39;s apple, chin, upper lip lift, eyelids, brow bone). I was hesitant about my jaw bone, I didn&#39;t really knew what to do with my nose and I wanted his overall opinion as well. At the end we both agreed that those weren&#39;t necessary. Unfortunately he does not do the tracheal shave anymore, but a fellow surgeon in Basel (I think?) is going to contact me for an appointment soon-ish. Dr Fakin showed me additional photos of other patient&#39;s similar surgeries (good looking), explaining where he would cut the skin, which bones he would correct/modify, what about scars (almost all hidden) etc. He took notes during the discussion and at the end took some mugshot-style photos of me (I looked dreadful, I hope to never see those again). Overall, I felt confident.
</p>
<p>
Sereina proposed a date for the surgery in less than two months time and I said hell yes.
</p>
<p>
I booked an hotel nearby the clinic for two nights. I had to be there very early in the morning thus traveling to there the same day wasn&#39;t an option. And staying the night of the surgeries was strongly suggested. A friend would come to pick me up from the clinic, stay at the hotel with me and drive me home the next day.
</p>
<p>
The day of the surgeries I was welcomed by a efficient nurse (who spoke only german, resulting in a couple of funny moments, but we managed to communicate and everything went fine). I then spoke with the anaesthetist (polyglot and also very kind) who explained me what/how, the risks, etc. Dr Fakin and Sereina arrived shortly after and gave me additional technical/formal infos. Richard drew stuff on my face (I mean the &#34;guide&#34; traits, no idea what&#39;s the name for that) as we chatted a bit (including dark jokes, lel). Then everything accelerated I was in a bed going down in an elevator then a needle was put in my arm and 1-2-3, I was out without even noticing.
</p>
<p>
I woke up in a quite confusional state, no idea how much time had passed. My friend was there, he received  some immediate aftercare instructions (he speaks german) and painkillers, antibiotics etc. Sereina told him everything went well and gave further instructions. I really was spaced out but fortunately my friend wasn&#39;t, and we had Sereina&#39;s direct number for any question or any help we may need during our night at the hotel.
</p>
<p>
Pain was persistent and no fun although less intense than I feared (I have a quite low tolerance). But continuous and annoying, it made it almost impossible to sleep.
</p>
<p>
My face was very swollen and I looked very weird. Five days later, the swelling diminished and I started to look more normal. That same day I went to Zürich for the 1st follow-up appointment. Sereina (&lt;3 so kind and helpful and patient) took off the stitches from my eyelids and I could see myself without the bandage. I was amazed, it was even better than I expected, I felt so elated and so happy. The moment I started HRT certainly changed my life, but these procedures are addressing decades of unwanted testosterone effects.
</p>
<p>
(Now that I finally like my features more, I tend to notice my asymmetries more than before. I don&#39;t know if I could have asked if something could have been done while doing the rest, but I think it&#39;s another type of job.)
</p>
<p>
At the time of my 2nd appointment, the swelling had already decreased by a lot. I had the stitches under the nose and those on the head removed, yay. A really annoying thing is the hair loss... although I didn&#39;t loose more than expected. (the fact that my hair is a mess in to begin with, really does not help). Anyway, now I look a lot more like me :-)
</p>
<p>
A few days ago I had my 3rd follow-up appointment, everything is fine!
</p>
<p>
Next follow-up scheduled in january. I&#39;ll edit this post and update it, if relevant news manifest. In the meantime you are welcome to ask me anything.

Hi there!
</p>
<p>
Stumbling here after looking for ffs options at some point, and i wondered how you are feeling about your results now? The process at least seemed to be easy! And did you get any financial help from the swiss health insurance system for the surgeries?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!
