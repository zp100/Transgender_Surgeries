I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your surgical experience in the hospital, and the complicated feelings you&#39;ve dealt with post-op. I definitely can relate to how difficult and isolating those emotions can be!
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s any consolation, and it might not be, you have a
<em>
beautiful
</em>
result in my honest, unbiased opinion.  I really don&#39;t see any asymmetry, and you have a very natural look that works really well with the aesthetic of your body. I do know though how difficult these feelings over your body can be, especially when you&#39;re overcoming trauma and having to live in your body and are able to see and experience things others won&#39;t, but I hope you&#39;re able to embrace it one day.

I think I see what you mean when you talk about your incisions, but I still think comparatively speaking your scarring and aesthetics are quite good compared to a lot of results I&#39;ve seen.  The asymmetry that bothers you, to an unbiased perspective, is unnoticeable.
</p>
<p>
However, I again sympathize with you completely. Having a good, bad, average, etc. result doesn&#39;t matter. Feeling like your care team didn&#39;t aid you much in recovery, and feeling like your surgeon was negligent and uncaring to your personal issues, is unacceptable. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through all this and I hope it turns to be brighter soon.

Let this be a warning to all who consider grs Montreal.  If you want to feel like just another day at the job for them with no best effort into the surgery. Again thats how i feel. This may not be the same for everyone else. However bad experience with staff, and results, and im pretty sure i felt akward strange and creeped out. When a phone was pulled out for me to get a &#39; better look&#39;  but not my roommate.. almost like a pervert.  Thats how i feel not necessarily true
</p>
<p>
I Was laying in bed recovering .with other roommate in own bed doing their own thing. As dr brassard walked in. I was about to dilate which i didnt cause i wanted to speak and ask things. As the situation continued. He got closer look and pulled out phone suddenly. Now to me just felt very pervy.  Especially since its not dark room. To me the expression on his face felt weird to me like he was maybe secretly recording or something.  I have no idea and im not trying to accuse him of being like anything but a surgeon whos supposed to have my best interest in mind when it comes to the surgery . He didnt pull phone for my roommate. Or even have a big smile with bright eyes

As well as i stated i wasnt in pain and i wasnt feeling pain just stinging sensations like a rash. I was given pain medication anyway despite me saying i wasnt in pain. As well as i was almost accused of lieing since apparently some want to tolerate. Which resulted me in vomiting multiple times for long hours. They do not treat everyone in a unique person. It feels like they have set standards and do not see me as a person. Automatic processing plant
</p>
<p>
Hypergranulation tissue was my only compilation. I dunno why but i didnt feel pain as most do. And was slight tightness pain when dilating 1 outta 10 . I had to treat myself with sliver nitrate because my family doctor was uncomfortable as well as waiting for permission from grs. Which is actually unreliable

I can&#39;t believe a doctor made you apply silver nitrate onto your own granulation tissue, that is incredibly disturbing. I&#39;m incredibly sorry you got shafted through your care. You deserve better.

Yes and unfortunately nurse practitioners and family doctors really want to rely on grs Montreal before treating the area. Thats how its been for me in my area. I was so scared about hypergranulation leaving dents causing holes or marks or ruining things even more that i felt i had no choice but to treat myself.

Dr. Brassard. The results may seem positive to some. However... i dont believe best effort was put into me. Not only this but he couldn&#39;t answer simple questions unique to my situation. As well as. He only seen me 3 times under ten mins out of those ten days.
</p>
<p>
One of my questions was depth. He stated 6 . But in reality it was 4 and it 100% felt like he didnt know or care
</p>
<p>
I had issues with cypst which was ultra sounded and documented. He was cluess to that. And said he didnt see anything... which makes me feel like he didnt pay attention at all or he stopped half way thru and let someone esle take over. Whoch would explain the unevenness .
</p>
<p>
I Absolutely regret letting a careless clinic take advantage of my hope for a better life

Oh wow I&#39;m sorry you experienced this... I definitely understand how it feels to have a medical professional not give an F about you and treat you like dollar sign. Either way there&#39;s always room for revisions in the future, and in my opinion you have almost perfect aesthetics considering how different cis vaginas look. With all that being said I employ you look/focus on the positives of your new equipment, it may be hard but we are by far the hardest on ourselves. We know exactly what to look for in terms of &#34;the bad&#34;, you have everything right and should feel upset about how you were treated and even though things aren&#39;t perfect you now have reached a goal an should feel proud. I hope things look bright in your future, if you need to vent I&#39;m always here.

Did you have any complications?  I was in extreme pain for over 1 month. Dilation was a nightmare. When I came out of surgery I lots a lot of blood where they wanted to perform a blood transfusion.

I could never Express enough how sleazy my surgery went thats how i feel.  As soon as the swelling went down. i knew i would dislike what i see. The incisions cuts are uneven. My vagina is not asymmetrical and i feel like there was absolutely no intent to have the best possible asymmetric even vagina. And dont even get me started on the aftercare for those 10 days. Even just the one event of a night time staff member kicking and sliding a grabage bag from the bathroom into and outof the room with no hands. Very very sanitary....

Other than the aesthetics, which I think are 100% fine, do you have complaints?
</p>
<p>
Is function there?  Both the plumbing and the electricity?
