Honestly I think your results look super good! If I were you Iâ€™d wait until youâ€™re fully healed up to make sure you really want to change anything :)

Yeah ditto what everyone else said, you look great. It seems like your midface is a bit long but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s super clocky at all (hard to tell 100% without more info)
</p>
<p>
I really hope you can figure out how to let go of wanting to &#34;fix&#34; things cuz I&#39;ve seen at least a couple girls kinda ruin themselves with extra surgery they didn&#39;t need
</p>
<p>
You do have a kinda fierce look in the hair-up pic but it&#39;s really good and people will find you mesmerizing even, if you can learn to own it.
</p>
<p>
I think you pass better in the pic with your forehead showing than you do with bangs fyi
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s gonna take time for you to adjust to having a new face.
</p>
<p>
Also not sure what you mean about making your face go downward... FFS is mostly about lifting things like your brows, your upper lip, the tip of your nose, etc. Your forehead is shorter now but not enough to be masculinizing.

thank you.  you and others in this thread have honestly been very helpful, and I felt much better about my face today than I have for a month.  I&#39;m not rushing to get extra surgery now.  I will probably do something about my chin, but that&#39;s mostly because this implant sucks and was in fact not even my idea.
</p>
<p>
I am curious as to what you mean by &#34;fierce look.&#34;  although it is appealing.  I have been told my eyes can be pretty intense and I&#39;m sort of proud of them.

You may consider getting a consult with facialteam to get a well regarded professional&#39;s opinion on your options as they do free virtual consults.

I&#39;m trying to understand what he may have done wrong, and I don&#39;t think you have bad results. Your chin looks barely different in the before / after. You look feminine!

<p>
Tall foreheads are a masculine feature. Making your forehead shorter is a feminizing change! Your forehead does not look unusually small from those photos.
</p>

<p>
I was given to understand FFS more or less always moved the features downwards
</p>

<p>
In the case of the eyebrows for MtF patients, they typically move upwards. Men have low-set brows, younger women have arched and higher brows. That is why older women get &#34;brow lifts&#34;, to make themselves look younger.

You&#39;re one month into a recovery that takes a year to really see the results and even if it isn&#39;t obvious, you have a TON of swelling that will take time to go down.
</p>
<p>
IIRC my results really started to firm up around the 3-6 month mark and it legitimately took the full year for my nose to settle down.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not a fan of your orbitals right now, but they&#39;re nowhere nearly settled yet and should open up more as swelling goes down. Your forehead was peeled back and then put back in place. Your soft tissues are very definitely swollen right now.
</p>
<p>
Having said that, I think your face is currently balanced in length, your forehead, midface, and lower face are all of roughly equal height. It may be longer than your preferred shape, but shortening your lower face would make your midface look long. It is also worth keeping in mind that swelling _will_ add some height to your chin for now.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if you had anything done to augment your cheeks (ie, implants or lipotransfer), but that may be something else to explore in the future as well.
</p>
<p>
Without a profile view it&#39;s hard to tell 100% about your forehead and chin projection, but from what I can tell from the front view I don&#39;t see anything glaringly obvious.

If I may ask, did you get a CT scan done pre-op?
</p>
<p>
And as others said, give it time. This takes from 12 to 18 months to fully heal.

it&#39;s not obvious, it just brings my recessed chin forward, which functionally adds some height.  it also was not my idea, I just trusted that the doctor had a decent aesthetic sense.

Looks like you need type 3 mine came out similar with Dr Z and a lot has to do with my now even clockier forehead  after type 1

I was skeptical of Cardenas insisting that I only needed Type 1, but bangs functionally negate that difference for most people.

I wear my  eyeglasses which hide it but have sent a request to Cardenas to actually do type 3 since he is relatively affordable though Iâ€™m curious to see what he will charge since I had type 1 already
