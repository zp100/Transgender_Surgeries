I&#39;m ten days post-op, too (Dr. Brassard). I had full-depth, but I&#39;m impressed at how much less bruising you have.

<p>
Happy healing!

34, what you would call overweight at 100kg, but did lose 50kg so not at my worst. Diet is fine, could probably stand to be a bit better but it&#39;s not junk food all day every day. Physically active more than I would say 80% of the population, walk an average 5-10km a day on top of my physically demanding job that has me on my feet for 8hrs a day.

Not having to dilate for the rest of ones life. And, I&#39;m older, so, if I was in my 20s or 30s, I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be an issue as I assume it&#39;d get enough use. I&#39;m older, I haven&#39;t dated in 5 years. I don&#39;t know how much use it&#39;ll get.

I haven&#39;t had sex in over 6 years, nor am I going out of my way to change that in a hurry. And if/when it happens again, I&#39;m exclusively interested in women so penetration was really of absolutely no concern to me, especially when you consider the concept of dilating for something you don&#39;t care for

You can always have the depth reduced, but it&#39;s much more difficult to increase it. I would go full depth, then if you don&#39;t like it, you can have it reduced to minimal depth or zero depth.

Revision surgeries exist to take a zero depth to full depth, and many surgeons around the world offer this revision.

Yes, but if your preferred surgical method is PI, you won‚Äôt have that as an option any more. You‚Äôd have to go with colon or PPT.

If your preferred surgical method is PI, you wouldn&#39;t opt for zero-depth to start with.

Thanks for sharing and congrats on what looks like a great result (in your 10day pics)!
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re up for sharing more, I have a few questions?
</p>
<p>
How did the recovery go? How painful was it?
</p>
<p>
How is sensation? Have you been able to orgasm?
</p>
<p>
Are able to access your g-spot with your 1 - 1.5 inches of depth?
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for sharing your pics!

Recovery, all things considered went very well. It had its challenges but it was very manageable for me. Five months on I am completely back to my normal life.

<p>
Sensation is good! There is a patch of skin between my left vulva and my leg that I have no sensation in, which isn&#39;t ideal but not the end of the world. Have orgasmed and find it to be much easier and much more desirable than before!

no access to G-spot. Nothing really of interest going on down there so I stick to clitoral stimulation

Thanks so much for the information! I read the other posts on your profile, 30 day, 60 day etc. If you&#39;re up for sharing more, I was wondering a few other things -
</p>
<p>
It sounds like you were doing pretty good at day 60. What were the challenges you had between then and month 5 when you felt entirely back to normal life?
</p>
<p>
Other than when you developed the hard lump, how painful was the recovery?
</p>
<p>
How long did you stay in Thailand? If your connecting flight had not been cancelled, do you think the trip back would have been as far as discomfort?
</p>
<p>
Thanks much if you have time to respond!

The biggest challenge after I came home was that i was always exhausted for the first couple months. I&#39;m also a chef, so I had to do some reworking of my hours so I wasn&#39;t standing in a kitchen for 10 hours a day or lifting heavy objects on my own. It took a good few weeks/couple months for this to come completely good.
</p>
<p>
Surgery hurts, no two ways around that, unfortunately. However, all things considered it was a manageable pain for me - I think from memory I stopped taking tramadol at about day 5, and stopped taking paracetamol a few days later.
</p>
<p>
Dr Chettawut asks all his patients to stay in Thailand for at least 30 days. This is to make sure you&#39;re healed enough to fly since there are serious concerns flying so close post op (DVT being a big one)
</p>
<p>
If there weren&#39;t issues with Malaysia Airlines it would&#39;ve been the smoothest flight home. I only live in Australia so it should have been a 2hr flight to KL, 2hr stopover, 5hr flight to home, but instead I was stuck in Malaysia with very little information for 18hrs, far from ideal!

I did have minor issues with wound separation and hematoma, both cleared on their own quite easily. No granulation

Do you recall if these issues occurred while you were still in Thailand?

Congratulations!  So happy for you and your terrific results!

Give those sweet lovely nurses a hug from me!  They‚Äôre wonderful.  I‚Äôm coming up on 11 months post op from Dr Chettawut and was thinking what a special time that was.
</p>
<p>
When I was finally encouraged to do my 10 minute walks down the hallways, I was the girl gently dancing down the hallways to dance club music on my phone on floor 7 (where I happened to be).  I was so happy I had to boogie!  It was good exercise.  Also for some reason I fell in love with the tuna salads on their menu.  Great recovery food I think‚Ä¶

Looks great!!! I am about 6 weeks post op from my zero depth, and still feel quite a bit of numbness. Curious if you do too. Thanks.

My left labia Majora is pretty well completely numb, but that&#39;s about the only spot I&#39;ve found to be. They say it&#39;ll take at least 3 months for the nerves to properly reconnect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yes so this area always had discolouration, but I stupidly never thought about it. Recently, I noticed patches on the top of my feet, and on my nipples, and I started to wonder about it. Then, when I got here in Thailand, the doc &#34;officially&#34; diagnosed me when he told me that there&#39;s obviously nothing that he can do to fix that.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t bother me, but if that ever changes, I can simply get it cosmetically tattooed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yea, I‚Äôm in the same boat I have it there and on my stomach (possibly other places too but I can‚Äôt tellüò≠) and I‚Äôm set to get surgery soon, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt bother me so I haven‚Äôt done anything about it. But, it‚Äôs nice to see another doll who has had it done with vitiligo so I know what to expect! :)

Edit: also omg only 10 days post op? Girl you look amazing
