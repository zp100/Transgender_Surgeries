Hey so i sarted &#39;&#39;exploring&#39;&#39; a bit my new parts. I noticed that my left labia has a weird sensation like hard sensitive skin which feels different than the right side more soft and pink (picture). When i run my finger on it it goes right through the vagina canal, does anybody relate? Also i entered a finger in the canal and at the entreance there is kind of a lump near where the urethra is. Is it what im feeling? The inside feels soft and moist though im impressed!

Can I ask a little more about which method and who you used? I don’t think the second one is particularly relevant to the post, that’s just because I’m super stoked by your results even so early on, but the first one might be relevant to your issue.

Pi by brassard, thanks for your kindness :) I had a bit of an opening early in the suture which is not completly healed. Now the only worry i have is this weird labia texture that seems not nornal..

That&#39;s hypergranulation. It needs to be treated with silver nitrate or excised.

I had dehisence at the canal entrance that was threated with silver nitrate. They said that its normal to be swollen and that it should be gone by the 90 day mark but it dosent feel swollen but more like a hard texture idk how To describe it..
