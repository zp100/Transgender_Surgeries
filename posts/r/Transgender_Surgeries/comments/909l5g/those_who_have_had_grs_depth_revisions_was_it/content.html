I had a friend who had a 5 corrections(doctor really screwed up) on everything but sadly I think it got worse.  Dont know what the deepest it was at.
</p>
<p>
She isn&#39;t the best at following through tho with after care and I think that has caused it it seal up sadly.
</p>
<p>
After talking to her about it a lot it scares me about getting the wrong surgeon. Dont know what I&#39;d do.

I only know of a few who used Brassard and of those I don&#39;t recall any having issues. Dr Meltzer was my surgeon. I do know I have heard issues with all Dr&#39;s including De Meltzer. I&#39;m sorry to hear he isn&#39;t helping as this all should be covered under him.

I&#39;m really sorry to read this and I can understand your frustration. I&#39;m still at 6&#34; depth as when I had GRS back in 2014. Was it only 2&#34; initially? Does your surgeon know what may have caused this?

I started out with roughly 4” and had to stop dilating due to complications so I lost another 2”. My surgeon wouldn’t help me so I have no idea what caused it but apparently I’m not the only one with a super shallow vagina from Brassard.
