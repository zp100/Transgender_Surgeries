I hope this post doesn&#39;t come off as hating on Suporn Clinic. This is just my honest review, and I am personally happy that I went there.
</p>
<p>
When you schedule surgery with The Suporn Clinic, you&#39;ll eventually get invited to their unofficial Facebook group and Discord channel. In the Discord channel, there is a spot where people share their results. In my opinion, based on my own neovagina and what I&#39;ve seen, generally the first surgery does not look natal or cis. Personally, I think other surgeon&#39;s work look better and closer first round. Some people get lucky the first try, but usually there is no clitoral hood/anterior commissure, big labia minora, and the urethra is too big making it look like an inner dick. Lack of posterior commissure also can make the vagina look like it is too low or below the vulva rather than in the vulva. Their technique almost sets themselves up for needing revision; They intentionally leave a lot of tissue just in case something happens or for revision, and by doing that, you usually need revision to get rid of all that stuff. In my opinion, the neovaginas I&#39;ve seen in the Discord channel that has had revision look like they are cis or natal. They do a really good job of cleaning things up on the inside and outside. My recommendation to people looking at Suporn is to consider it a two step surgery rather than one.

When I first looked 2+ years ago the photos on the suporn website were old.
