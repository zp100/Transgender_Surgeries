Hey all, Just wanted to share Dr. Suporn&#39;s publication in 2019 detailing his technique. I think this paper really made me appreciate how incredible of a technique it is. It&#39;s basically genital origami üòÇ
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094014319300552?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094014319300552?via%3Dihub</a>
</p>
<p>
The way it works he first removes the testicles, dissects the area where the vagina goes and removes the scrotum. He then makes a ring shaped cut halfway around the penis, removes most of the erectile tissue in the shaft, and cuts a small nub onto the top of the glans to make the clitoris. He keeps a strip of fiborous tissue connected to the glans and stiches it to the pubic bone to secure the clitoris. He then cuts along the back of the foreskin and rotates it downwards to make the inner labia. The top of the newly created labia minora is then joined to the nubs on the glans to make the two frenulums. He then points the remaining base of penis skin downwards and makes a long cut where he pokes the reconstructed clit and labia out of and stiches them together. He then reconstructs the vagina using the scrotum as a skin graft.
</p>
<p>
Having read that paper I am convinced that no other technique can match the level of homologous-ness to cis vaginas and the level of aesthetic that his technique achieves (not saying that there aren&#39;t surgeons as good, just that this technique is the best if your priorities are aesthetics and similarity to cis vaginas). I also like that the vulva is made from penile skin flaps i.e. the skin isn&#39;t completely cut but remains partially attached which gives better sensation. Also there are disadvantages - long and difficult recovery because of the use of skin grafts, and the possibility of retaining too much erectile tissue which can require revision (cis females also have erectile tissue in their clitoris but it&#39;s a challenge of balancing too much vs too little.)
</p>
<p>
Suporn himself has said in an interview that he has spent his whole life continuously improving and refining his technique and believes that no further improvements can be made with the final technique he has developed without breakthroughs like stem cells.

Dr. Bank has taken over after being trained under Suporn for several years! I&#39;ve heard good stores from people who have gone under him. I&#39;m booked in to him for whenever Suporn clinic opens up again after covid.

I had surgery with suporn in 2018 and even then when people at the clinic were talking about it, it seemed like people who went to bank had &#39;better&#39; results many times. You should have a great result with him. &lt;3 Hope it works out.

Suporn or Bank, to me their technique does create a more consistantly cis looking female vulva.  I just wish Thailand was a little close to the US East Coast. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Good God, after reading the Suporn essay and the pics, it explains a great deal.  He really has two methods of creating a vulva.  If you have foreskin material and a good deal of penis tissue you get version one and these seem to turn out the best.  The second is for those with less material.  So that kind of explains why some of his look better than others.  I wish it would have explained his ‚Äúmesh‚Äù technique of the testicle flesh lining the neo-vagina.  Suporn really is a brilliant surgeon.

The &#34;mesh&#34; technique is a bit of a misconception. He uses a testicular full thickness skin graft. Full thickness skin grafts generally are NOT meshed unlike split thickness skin grafts. What he&#39;s doing for the skin graft is not meshing it but cutting small holes to drain any kind of bleeding which would cause a void and prevent the graft from taking (the graft needs to sit firmly against the base tissue so new blood vessels can grow into it.) A lot of people confuse his process of preparing the skin graft with split skin grafts which are meshed to increase their size for covering burns.
</p>
<p>
Source: he mentioned this in an interview done by a member of asktg in 2015. Also the technique he uses is fairly common in plastic/reconstructive surgery (I have a medical background).

I think the surgeon at Kaiser&#39;s southern California surgery center does it the same way.

When I met them for my consultation the ways in which they described the procedure were very similar. Keeping the skin attached, cutting circular flap, scooping out erectile tissue, etc. They don&#39;t scrape hair follicles though.

Based off what I&#39;ve heard and seen (via photos) it&#39;s very close but based off photos he doesn&#39;t reconstruct the clitoris to the same level of detail as Suporn, especially with the clitoral frenulum (I don&#39;t think Chettawut reconstructs the frenulum at all). I do believe Chettawut&#39;s technique is mostly based off Suporn and it&#39;s still very good but if you look at photos the clitoris looks noticeably less delicate and intricate.

I don‚Äôt think that paper is a complete description of Suporn‚Äôs technique. It‚Äôs title says it‚Äôs about aesthetics and I believe he has a lot of structural differences to other techniques. Hopefully there will be another paper.
</p>
<p>
Suporn also acknowledges the help of another surgeon in writing that paper, and she‚Äôs interested in peritoneal vaginoplasty, so I‚Äôm curious to see if anything happens there in the future.

Does anyone know what he does if the individual was circumcised?  I&#39;m considering Suporn/Bank but I want to make sure their method can deal with my... material.

If you read the article, he outlines two slightly different methods depending on whether the individual is circumcised or not, &#39;type a&#39; and &#39;type b&#39;

Not one to mince words are you lol.  I don&#39;t generally like to consider myself a victim, not a whole lot of empowerment in that idea.

Any recommendations for surgeons whose methods accommodate circumcised patients effectively?

I wish I had gone to someone in the US because they see a lot more patients in that situation. It may be different now but they only stopped saying it would be no problem the day before the operation

Awesome, this is good to know.  Right now I&#39;m considering Dr. Jess Ting, and Dr. McGinn.  Leaning towards Ting, as I&#39;d like to avoid penile inversion if possible.

Why can&#39;t the erectile tissue be used for the rest of the vagina?

The erectile tissue is of a different composition (it&#39;s basically a fiborous spongy bag) to what you need to line cavities (e.g. skin or mucosa.)

Wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to use it for the clit?

I do believe a small quality of erectile tissue is retained in the glans for the clit so your clit can become erect post SRS (just like in cis women.)  You don&#39;t need all of it though, because the clit is tiny compared to the penis. A penis is basically an overgrown clit (or another viewpoint is a clit is a tiny penis.) Someonee can correct me if I&#39;m wrong.

For what it‚Äôs worth, if you look at clitoris growth from testosterone the resemblance is remarkable.
