Apologies for not posting photos. Feel free to ask me anything.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
tl;dr:
</strong>
11/10 would surgery again. I love my pussy, shes so cute and it feels wonderful. Also, clothes finally fit the way I want them too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Process!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
This was an incredibly quick process. I reached out to the surgeon coordinator beginning of May 2021. The earliest date I could have had was summer July 2021. Due to nicotine, then covid, my surgery date was moved to the first week of December 2021.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Hamidian and Dr. Douglass work as a team with Douglass focusing on interior urology stuff and Hamidian focusing on exterior appearance stuff. They&#39;re both incredibly caring doctors who will listen to your needs, and can explain the reasons for their recovery process in clear and concise manner. Although they have very different bedside manners, it&#39;s very easy to talk to both of them.
</p>
<p>
For example, I walked the first day after surgery and they use a LOT less packing then other surgeons. Since they said that they&#39;ve had better patient outcomes.
</p>
<p>
I was thrown for a loop because I only met Dr. Hamidian a week before surgery due to him being new to the hospital. It was definitely a bit stressful to have a large change, but I couldn&#39;t imagine the surgery with out him.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Looks!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s really pretty, I might need to get a revision to get a better clitoral hood, but otherwise I&#39;m happy with it at the 2 months. There is a lot of swelling so I reserve any final judgements on apperance. I have about 5in (12.7 cm) of depth
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Bad Feels! (Pain)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I barely had any. I&#39;m probably not a &#34;normal&#34; case, but I really wasn&#39;t in all that much pain through out the entire experience. I was sitting cross legged a few days after surgery, and  able to walk by myself on the 2nd  day, and was doing regular laps of the hospital unit by the 4th. I&#39;m finally feeling muscle spasms, but I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m dehydrated and it&#39;s cold/dry outside.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Good Feels! (Pleasure)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I can orgasm fairly easily, with different feels of orgasms depending on how I masturbate. It&#39;s a bit painful when I get a
<em>
too
</em>
excited, &gt;&lt;&#34;
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still taking it easy as far as exercise and moving around, but I was able to start working on light chores a few days after returning home, I&#39;m back to normal now regarding house cleaning. I&#39;m still hesitant to lift/overexert myself. I&#39;m hopeful that by my next appointment (5ish weeks from now) I&#39;ll be able to start skateboarding again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall Hospital experience!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not perfect: Without going in to details I was not receiving a high level of care the first day out of surgery. I made a complaint to one of the fellows. The nurse supervisor was contacted and my nurse was immediately replaced by someone else. By the end of the night I was moved to a different floor that was better trained by Dr. Douglass.
</p>
<p>
The hospital stay wasn&#39;t 100% without stress, but they listened when I had a problem and corrected it. They opened an incident report and took into account my suggestions for improving patient experience . I&#39;ve been kept abreast of the steps theyâ€™ve taken to not let it happen again. I sincerely believe that the surgeon teams are doing their best to create the safest  environment to recover, and unfortunately I had a nurse who did not respect me. (Please note that I did tell them that I understand the distinction between overworked nurses, nurses who are disengaged from their work, and the nurse that I believe was being transphobic.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Three month post op visit edit:
</strong>
Great news, I had very little granulation that they treated with silver nitrate.  I can start to have penetrative sex. I can reach clitoral orgasm much easier vs when I had a penis.
</p>
<p>
bummer news, Turns out the reason my clitoral hood is basically nonexistant is because I am too thin (5&#39;10 | 135 lbs at time of surgery). They didn&#39;t have enough
<em>
stuff
</em>
to really design the top portion of the hood as nicely as they would have if I was a bit larger. I&#39;m not sure how this stacks up to different surgeons, i&#39;m not really going to pursue anything further because i&#39;m happy overall.

Thank you for sharing your story, im close to Temple and have heard good things about Dr Douglass so I&#39;m setting up my consult. I haven&#39;t seen and pics of her work yet though which worries me a bit but I&#39;ve heard nothing but satisfaction. I&#39;m sure she will provide results during her consult so ill be patient for that.  So glad to hear there&#39;s someone in my area and u don&#39;t have to travel halfway across the globe.

Thank you for the update! It makes sense that being skinny could cause issues when they are working with your existing skin. At my consultation they told us that having extra skin was useful so to try not to lose too much weight before the surgery.

Thank you so much for such a detailed description of overall satisfaction. I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t have enough &#34; stuff&#34; to achieve the perfect scenario for you but it sure looked great to me and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re good with where you are. Please keep us updated and I&#39;ll be sure to tell Dr Douglass in May at my consult what I&#39;ve read.

Hello. While I&#39;m still getting a consultation arranged, I&#39;ve been trying to look into Temple&#39;s BMI requirements for vaginoplasty, since I know I&#39;m too high for some places right now, and I&#39;d want to be certain of my target as soon as possible. Do you know about the details there?

<p>
they told me that they don&#39;t have set bmi requirements partly bc BMI isn&#39;t a good indicator of health from patient to patient.
