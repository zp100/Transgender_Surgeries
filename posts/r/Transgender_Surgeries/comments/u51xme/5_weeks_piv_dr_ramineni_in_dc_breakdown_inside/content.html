Alright! Going from some solid labia dehiscence and large black scabbing to what is starting to resemble a vagina I am growing happier with every single day.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve returned to work, though I do work from home so not much stress to the body at all. Sitting I can do for long periods of time no donut and feel good after so long as I keep adjusting my body on chair.
</p>
<p>
I am very mobile again and doing some light workouts. Bridges have become my life since I do them for dilating and putting a puppy pad under me. The pad is needed because I don&#39;t just get wet, I get
<em>
soaking
</em>
wet. I have to wear maxi pads normally simply because I have a very dirty mind and often times would ruin my panties otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Bathroom is easy again and so is showering. I use a peri bottle to squirt in the area. Peeing is a 50/50 between a solid stream or spray. I use wet Wipes to wipe I still don&#39;t feel confident to use TP though I do tap dry with TP.
</p>
<p>
Sex is wonderful. At 4 weeks I was cleared for play outside of penile penetration. (I am a lesbian).) And I feel everything. Fingering and clit stimulation are like nothing I could have ever imagined. I was told that if I wasn&#39;t so tight I would have squirted when I first orgasmed.
</p>
<p>
Real talk issues: Post op depression is real. Very real. I would be lying and doing a disservice if I did not warn you all that it can hit and hit like a never ending train. Daily I cry worrying I made a mistake, and sometimes I feel like I did. It has taken a strong hit on my relationship with my partner and friends. Please have mental health help ready after you get surgery. Do not make my mistake. (I also have a slew of many mental health issues as a baseline)
</p>
<p>
Life: I am trying to walk and move as much as I can. I intend to start Rugby training again at 8 weeks, I am able to see and drive to my friends again. I am able to shop, and do things I want again. Throughout all of this healing, I never broke a 2 or 3 in pain. I have a very high pain tolerance but it never felt very painful. What I felt the most was discomfort and that does still happen sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Dilating: I am at 4 dots at big orange and 5 dots on blue. I cannot help but play with myself when I dilate (I play gently when I do.)

This will heal very well long term and you will be great.  Try not to doubt your self.Some dehiscence is common and almost all heal very well.  Your surgery was not really that long ago and things are already so much better.  We transwomen are full of self doubt and shame,(internalized transphobia) look at the works of shame by Brene Brown and lift yourself upand go back in the ring.  You are a strong woman, so courageous just to step out the door.  Surround yourself with your friends and fiance who love you. They will help lift you up when you need it.  The posterior commissure and introitus will heal.  Overall swelling will go down with time.  You were recently reborn with the correct beautiful body you should have always had.  Take good care of it and yourself. Remember you are a strong, courageous, beautiful WOMAN.  Many hugs to you.  Bridget

I also had dehiscence with this surgeon. He then sewed me back up after letting the local anesthetic sit for maybe 10 seconds. I was screaming and he threatened to stop if I didn&#39;t stop yelling.
