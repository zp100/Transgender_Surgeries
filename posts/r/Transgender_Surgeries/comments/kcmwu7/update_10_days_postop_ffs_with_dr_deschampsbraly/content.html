Hi everyone! I made a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ka51xk/ama_6_days_post_ffs/">small post a few days ago
</a>
, but I wanted to wait until more time had passed to do something a little more comprehensive. I&#39;ll probably do an even more detailed post with more pictures in 1-2 weeks! Also, I am more than happy to answer your questions!

General Thoughts &amp; Recommendations
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Bring/acquire a humidifier!
<ul>
<li>
Dry mouth and throat and all the side effects of this were AWFUL. Far, far worse than I expected.
</li>
<li>
Hard candies or cough drops are a great idea for helping distract yourself and keep your mouth wet. I figured this out later than I would have liked.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Soylent is the way to go
<ul>
<li>
My attempts at blending savory &#34;meals&#34; were mostly failures. I often augmented my Soylent with fruits, veggies, and supplement powders.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Pack light. Bring zip/button tops and/or tops with wide collars.
<ul>
<li>
I basically ended up wearing fewer than 3 outfits over the course of nearly 2 weeks.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I really wish I had a boba straw for the first week!
<ul>
<li>
Even 10 days out, my lips are still sore and numb, and hard to use, especially for eating &amp; drinking.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
I found sleeping, walking, and watching TV to be the best activities during the first week.
<ul>
<li>
Reading, writing, and video games—for whatever reasons—were less appealing.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

I’m glad I gave myself a few more days (4 more) before traveling back, but’s totally doable. I’d recommend giving yourself at least a day, maybe two, after second post-op to chill, pack, and continue recovering before traveling. I was really antsy to get home by the 4th day.

<p>
yes of course! it’s probably going to be a very challenging uphill battle under your circumstances
</p>
<p>
I have access to a health advocate at Aetna who works with trans patients, but that’s not common to most Aetna plans. I also had support from my company’s and my parent company’s HR.
</p>
<p>
You’ll need to get letters from a doctor and therapist articulating medical necessity, and everything will be rejected at least once.
</p>
<p>
Getting DB covered at in-network rates will require you to prove that no one in your network performs FFS and/or can do so in a reasonable time-frame. Honestly, without an employer that self-funds insurance (very uncommon for small and medium size companies) this is likely unobtainable.
</p>
<p>
If your company provides other specialized benefits like parental leave, you may be able to work with then to create specialized benefits for trans employees until they are ready to self-fund insurance.
</p>
<p>
Once a company self-funds, they have full authority to tell the insurance company what is and is not covered, what exceptions are to be made for who, and when exceptions can be made for network deficiencies.
</p>
<p>
That was my situation, and even then it was a four-way telephone game for months and months to figure everything out.
</p>
<p>
Two years prior I worked with my employer to add coverage for most of the procedures generally excluded by insurance companies as “not medically necessary” and getting FFS approved was the first big test. It was messy, but worked!
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to fight, you can very likely get FFS covered with an in network surgeon, or get it covered with an out of network surgeon at out of network rates.

I had to fight to make this happen at my job: 2 years ago to get FFS and lots of other stuff explicitly added to coverage for trans employees, and over the past many months to get my FFS approved, get it approved at in-network rates, and get it approved with Dr. D. All of this was a nightmarish emotional rollercoaster, but in the end absolutely worth it.

I work for a company owned by IAC, but we get our insurance via IAC with Aetna.

As far as I know they’ve started directly accepting sbux because of the supplemental coverage but I’m still a little worried because they require a 7500 non refundable deposite before they will work with insurance which is a bit scary

Yeah, the deposit was scary. I have a pretty good job in tech, but I&#39;ve never YOLO&#39;d that much onto a credit card before, especially all at once. I&#39;ve cumulatively probably spent that much (or a bit more?) on fertility banking (4 years ago) and laser hair removal (over the past few years) combined. I&#39;m optimistic about getting laser covered by insurance at least partially going forward though, so that&#39;s exciting.

Trans women in Europe should consider DB in addition to FT and Inglrfield if they are gonna travel and take a big risk for FFS. Expensive yes but higher chance of success.

I was very impressed with Facial Team, and the recovery experience they provide seems just completely, luxuriously incredible.
</p>
<p>
The final two I narrowed down to were DB and MDM, and the pandemic travel restrictions essentially made the decision for me.
</p>
<p>
I’m super happy with how everything went, and while I have no way of knowing how any of this would have played out in a non-pandemic-world, I think I ultimately would have chosen DB, especially after securing insurance coverage for everything.

Let’s just say expensive enough that without insurance I truly don’t think it would have been attainable for me even with lots of saving, crowdfunding, and huge loans 😓

I’ll say that it’s a common practice for surgeons to quote very high when it is known that a negotiation with insurance will take place. And therefore, both 😉

I was super diligent about prep, and I&#39;m overkilling it with supplements and a healthy high protein liquid diet right now. Honestly though, I think this is a testament to how talented Dr. D is.

Whoa—birds of a feather! I wrote a paper on DG &#39;becoming&#39; in grad school but haven&#39;t looked at Deleuze since. Pretty much the same with Bergson. I&#39;ll revisit. Thanks for the heads-up!

Difference &amp; Repetition, and anything he wrote on Nietzsche, as well as the Time/Cinema books would probably be relevant!

He is amazing, and so is the whole team. I did virtual consults with him and others due to the pandemic... ultimately decided to spend the money to fly to SF a few months ago to re-do my consult with him in person, and I&#39;m so glad I did. Meeting him completely sealed it for me, and I felt so much more confident and calm about everything afterward.

How much was the virtual consultation, and did you have to pay again for the second one?

Honestly, I don’t remember. A couple hundred? I want to say $250. Second was free, but ultimately far more expensive as I had to travel across the country. I always found the consult fees for this and other things a little frustrating generally, but for FFS especially, it’s such an insignificant thing compared to the cost of surgery and the effect it has on your life.

Wow...  amazing how profound the reduction in swelling from the day +2 picture to day +7.    He must have a hell of a protocol to minimize the duration of the swelling.   When did you start to walk outside and how much did you walk each day?   You planned and sacrificed a lot to get it done right - - the first time.  Without cutting corners.    Looks like that all worked out according to plan.
</p>
<p>
Really great result!    Congratulations !

He requires (suggests?) a very low sodium and low carb diet for a few weeks before surgery. I&#39;ve noticed that many of his prep rules common to other surgeons have have a few extra days/weeks than the averages.
</p>
<p>
I literally started walking hours after surgery (I have no idea how many) with a nurse in the hospital. It was short distances at first, and then eventually full laps around the floor I was on. He told me to walk 2 hours a day as soon as possible. I didn&#39;t average 2 hours, but the San Francisco hills where I am are pretty intense!  I definitely got a light workout from walking 30-90min each day, skipping maybe one or two days over the past 10.

I managed to get connected with an Aetna Health Advocate (i think that’s what they’re called?) who works with trans patients and has helped people see Dr. D before. She was essential for so much of this process, and many other trans-medical related interactions with Aetna.

I also argued that Dr. D is one of a small number of craniomaxillofacial surgeons with significant experience doing FFS who didn’t have a combined waiting list length for consults and surgeries of over a year.
