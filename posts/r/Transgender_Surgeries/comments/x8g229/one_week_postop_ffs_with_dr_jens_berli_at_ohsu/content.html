Since this is early on in my recovery there&#39;s still a good deal of swelling - especially in the nose - but I&#39;m feeling pretty good all things considered. I had a brow lift, brow contour, nose ridge reduction, and alar base reduction. Berli will also be performing a lip lift and tracheal shave at a later date. More pics to come as I continue to heal.
