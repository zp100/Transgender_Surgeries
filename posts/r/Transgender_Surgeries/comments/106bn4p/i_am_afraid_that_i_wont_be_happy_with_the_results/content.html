I’m not sure which surgeons you’re looking into where they’re terrible. Most pictures especially right after surgery will look scary because of the bruising or swelling but that’s normal.
</p>
<p>
Dr Min Jun at the crane center is a literal artist, same with Rachel Bluebond-Langner, Dr Jess Ting, Heidi Wittenberg &amp; Adam Bonnington, Dr Stiller, Dr Banks. It also comes down to the patients recovery, their BMI, their health. But these surgeons are the best based off of consistent patients outcomes IMO.

I think most people will tell you that would rather it work well and have great sensitivity then look perfect. This is what I would say as well. If you go into this with that kind of outlook your bound to get yourself disappointed.

There are plenty of great outcomes here from a variety of surgeons. Just scroll down the posts. Like this one:

This is probably not what u want to hear but there is a lot of luck involved too. Ur surgeon def matters a lot but there is still a luck element. I’ve seen people go to the same top surgeon and have a perfect aesthetic and then people who had something less than that. We kinda don’t get to exactly pick how are vulvas look, it’s like 60% surgeon, 40% luck in my honest pov. The advice that no trans person really wants to hear is that you will not get a cis vagina, you will get someone’s best try at working with what you have and it’s kinda important to go in with a mindset that you accept the limitations of this surgery and that imperfect aesthetic is the last thing on the list of possible complications.

Dr. BB / Zhou said that it is your anatomy that determines how it will look. I don&#39;t think it is wise to put in an order for a designer vagina, just let your body tell you and ket the doctors do their magic. You can prepare your body by cutting out drugs, smoking and take vitamins and anti inflammation supplements at least six weeks before surgery so your body has the best ability to heal.

The worst I&#39;ve seen was - well, nevermind; I don&#39;t want to be sued - but his work looked like an uncooked Thanksgiving turkey butt.
<em>
Even when I was 15 years old, I would have said NO! to that!
</em>
</p>
<p>
I think it is well worth making mandatory... that any (every!) surgeon you consider...
<strong>
MUST
</strong>
show you pictures of his / her completed, healed work.  Keep in mind you&#39;ll
<em>
only
</em>
be shown &#34;the best of the best&#34;.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Ask about the complications their patients have experienced; how / why did those occur?
</em>
Hopefully, the doctor will admit that they HAVE made mistakes - and learned from them.  You cannot learn without making mistakes; the surgeon should be willing to correct them, without charge.

You cant get sued if it is your honest assessment of a shitty doctor. It is a public service announcement for the prospective patients who can be harmed and a signal that you can&#39;t keep screwing people up with incompetent work and keep getting away with it. Doctors lean on the protections that are given them by the profession and their covering up for each other.

You can get sued. They may not have a case, but can you afford a lawyer to defend yourself? There’s a surgeon doing that.

You&#39;re correct, of course; I just don&#39;t want the hassle.
</p>
<p>
I will, however, state that I recently went to Dr. Benny Tan (UFHealth, Jacksonville) to consider him for surgery... and I&#39;m pretty seriously disappointed that I visited him on THREE separate occasions, only for him to tell me that &#34;I&#39;m too old&#34; to have SRS.
</p>
<p>
WTF???  He knew my age from Day One.  First, my overall health and vitality is noticeably better than is the vast number of people my age, AND... I profoundly deeply want the surgery, AND... I profoundly want to recover fully and completely from it, so I can wear my new vagina out before I die.  Each of those are High-Quality Motivations for solid healing and recovery.
</p>
<p>
I
<em>
personally
</em>
feel like the three visits... was for the purpose of generating additional revenue from my insurance company.  Just my opinion; I may be wrong.  But as stated; he knew my age from before Day One.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, I had to visit a Urologist for a Consultation (a &#34;Conversation&#34;, if you will) and he insisted I had to have a Prostate Exam.
</p>
<p>
WHY?  For a
<em>
consultation?
</em>
When SRS, if any, would be many,
<em>
many
</em>
months downstream - If Ever?  Again, it felt like &#34;revenue production&#34;.  I have Zero respect for being treated like a piece of meat.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, I was &#34;sold&#34; a Surgical Soap package... again, months/years in advance of my ever possibly needing it... And I wonder how much that Surgical Soap was.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was $150 for something which I could buy a very similar product from Walmart for, for less than $10.
</p>
<p>
Again; Just Me Bitching.  I&#39;m probably wrong, mistaken, emotional and anything else you can throw in there for me to be wrong.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Dr. Tan... REFUSED...  to allow me to see pictures of his completed work; that one is a MAJOR RED FLAG to me.  As to myself, as the pictures would never include either Names or Faces... I personally wouldn&#39;t care in the least if he want to show prospects
<em>
my
</em>
neo-vagina as a representative sample of his work.  There is no &#34;invasion of privacy&#34;, as he stated.  No one would know it&#39;s &#34;me&#34;; they would merely see an anonymous sample of his work.  It&#39;s personally VERY bothersome that he refused to allow me to see such pictures, and you
<strong>
know
</strong>
every doctor takes them -
<em>
Just In Case
</em>
there is ever a lawsuit / complaint about the surgery.

I think I recall he came from Boston.  I cannot imagine a future for him in Jacksonville, if he continues to have this closed kind of attitude.  It won&#39;t play well, here.

It is.  I&#39;m profoundly disappointed; offended, even, that he adamantly
<em>
refused
</em>
to show me pictures, citing HIPPA.  Personally, I consider it absolutely, utmostly Professional to take pride in his work and to show it off.  As mentioned; that was Big Red Flag for me.

No; actually, Bowers&#39; results seem to be first-class; even better than first-class.  She&#39;s become, I think, President of WPATH (or
<em>
something
</em>
like that; you can look her up) and she&#39;s become a tad conservative about some aspects of transgender care (which I don&#39;t really agree with, but she&#39;s the one with vast, and high-quality experience, so.......)
</p>
<p>
But, no, she&#39;s one of the Good Ones.

I believe you&#39;re correct; Jazz&#39;s surgery didn&#39;t come out well.  Lack of tissue from too-small penis, I think - and it was corrected later, but still...
</p>
<p>
I have seen some photos of Bowers&#39; work which really, truly was so very nicely done.  My personal biggest fear would be having surgery which didn&#39;t come out well.
</p>
<p>
I went to a Dr. Benny Tan, UFHealth, Jacksonville, FL... and I would NOT recommend him to... well, anyone other than my worst enemy.  (Except that none of them are TG, so...)  He refused to show me pictures of his work (&#34;they&#39;re private&#34;).  WTF?  Photos never show faces nor include names; they&#39;re... just pictures!  That was a major problem for me.  Tan eventually (after three visits) decided I&#39;m &#34;too old&#34;.  He knew my age prior to my first visit, so...

In fact choosing a surgeon implies the one who really cares for functionality not sexuality, but being able to pee normally and not having to wear a vesical bag for life are the things to take in account on deciding what surgeon or not.
</p>
<p>
Be sure you choose someone who does a good job on these areas too.

Aesthetically Dr Bank in Thailand (took over Dr Suporn’s practice) is going to give you the best aesthetic results. Good depth, minimal scarring, full sensation.

You’ve got to account for the fact that most people aren’t going to want to consent to their 🐱being posted on the internet for most to see, some are fine with it initially (the “terrible” results you see are usually them fresh out of surgery or only a couple days post op) once they’re healed they likely don’t want their vaginas posted or didn’t keep in contact with their surgeon afterwards. Sorta the same thing with Reddit where more people happily post their post op surgical pictures that’s bruised, swollen, and bloody, but don’t usually return to post the fresh healed version unless something is wrong.

It takes about a year to see the final results.  Keep that in mind when you&#39;re looking at pictures. While there are surgeons to avoid, most of them produce acceptable results.

I don&#39;t know how you feel about it, but I can tell you from my experience doesn&#39;t even matter how a good result, it will be something new and foreign to you and you will have to get used to it. It is temporary, so i&#39;m just saying that you won&#39;t be happy right away but once you start to heal and the vol will start to disappear then a miracle and honey

Definitely. I&#39;m expecting it will take a while to get used to it. Tbh the thing I&#39;d be looking forward to most is clothing options. If i get surgery my self imposed clothing restrictions will all go away. I can wear whatever i want. But getting used to it outside of wearing clothes will be a bit of a struggle most likely

The best thing to do is look at results several months in the future. As far as cosmetics go, most of the scarring is hidden with folds and such while some are covered by a little bit of pubic hair. Then of course there is scar fading which happens with proper care. I&#39;ve seen several pictures from several different surgeons that have an end result I honestly would never have guessed wasn&#39;t afab. Keep looking until you are satisfied but be sure to look for pictures far after surgery. In the end, never do anything any you aren&#39;t 100% sold on.

I really don&#39;t know why you are judging op. We all have our reasons to get srs. Aesthetics weren&#39;t#1 on my list but if I couldn&#39;t get a vagina that looked like...a vagina, I wouldn&#39;t have done it. Be nice

I had the same concern. It&#39;s easy to get hung up on doubts and talk yourself out of transitioning (letting the perfect be the enemy of the good) and if this might be you, it&#39;s not a good idea.  That said there&#39;s a few surgeons who are getting amazing results, and they&#39;re improving all the time.

Personally, I was happy to have my misaligned body fixed as long as things worked and looked OK. I didn’t understand the mentality of having things that looked “perfect” if I ended up with a colostomy bag and couldn’t urinate without medical help. Don’t knock function and sensation because those things do matter. I don’t know where the urban legend started that there’s doctors that only care about looks and don’t care about what other things work or not, because it just isn’t true. You might think that appearance is all that matters, but you won’t be feeling very sexy if you end up with a colostomy bag. And it does happen. My first surgery didn’t look perfect, but fortunately everything worked  OK. I was able to have it improved cosmetically later and even the less than original results were still way better than what I started off with.
</p>
<p>
You might look at some cis non-porn vulvas. “Realistic” and “nice looking” are not always synonymous. It sounds like what you’re asking for is something porn star quality with no concern if there is any sensation or function at all, but again, if you can’t urinate or end up with a bowel perforation “function” will absolutely be a consideration after all. Realistic expectations are important, and if the only thing you will be happy with is perfection then it probably is best you avoid surgery because no doctor can guarantee something with no scarring for example.

I have been slightly looking into zero depth vulvaplasty because looks matter more than function to me. I am perfectly fine not using it for sex, but also, when I say looks I mean like, I will be okay with almost whatever as long as it isn&#39;t a penis.

I would guess they have the best photos on their sites which look the closest most realistic. Maybe do more research to find a doctor that has the best most realistic outcomes?
