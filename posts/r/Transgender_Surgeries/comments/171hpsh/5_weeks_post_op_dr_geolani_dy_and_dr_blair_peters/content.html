This was PPT. I am very happy with depth so far. I&#39;m up to the 1.5&#34; diameter dialator and can get 5-6&#34; depth.

Looks really good!  I‚Äôm waiting on scheduling for Dy &amp; Peters. I hope to get surgery this winter sometime.
</p>
<p>
How‚Äôs the pain?  How long did you need a ‚Äúsupport person‚Äù for?

Make an appointment with a pelvic floor specialist.  It is something surgeons or doctor‚Äôs do not mention.  I have a weak pelvic floor so i had intense pain with large dilations for years.  The pelvic floor is essential to healing.

I&#39;m 30+ days out and I have no more pain at all. Dilation is sometimes uncomfortable but I would not describe it as painful. I was in the hospital for 5 days and the amazing staff there took care of me so I did not have a whole lot of pain. The trick once you get home is to take the OTC pain meds they recommend on a set schedule whether you think you need them or not. Then if you get pain on top of that you have the heavy stuff that is very effective. Stay ahead of the pain and it&#39;s much easier to control.
</p>
<p>
I was fairly helpless for the first two weeks after the hospital. So my support person (spouse) brought me meals, meds and helped me with dilation, which took a bit of time to get used to. The real challenge is they are going to want you to really limit your steps -- essentially stay in bed except to go to the  bathroom so the support person is invaluable there to help with chores like laundry.

Have you ever consulted with Dr. Dugi? That‚Äôs who I was assigned; but I‚Äôm leaning towards requesting Doctors Peters &amp; Dy.

Thank you for sharing your results and healing progress!

Definitely looking into Dy/Peters, but idk if I can stand their waitlist, unless it‚Äôs gotten significantly shorter in recent times‚Ä¶

I hear you. My consult with Dr. Dy was right after she joined OHSU so I would have had to wait only a year but for the pandemic and some other delays out of anyone&#39;s control. I ended up with a three-year wait. Turns out I needed at least two years to finish electro hair removal anyway.
</p>
<p>
I will say that on the other side of surgery, I&#39;m so glad I went with this team. It took a lot of patience and seemed like it would never happen, but I know I made the right decision.

Start researching pelvic floor specialists and ask your surgeon about it.  No one tells us about it and if you have any problems a strong healthy pelvic floor with do wonders.

If they have been notified you are at 80% someone will reach out to give you an idea off your wait time. So keep going with the electro. My last 20% took longer than I would have guessed...

Very much so. Separation healed very nicely and I&#39;m much less swollen. I&#39;ve got some lingering granulation tissue but even that is getting better.

That‚Äôs great! So when you open your legs your labia majora opens up more? I‚Äôm 2 months out and noticing that mine doesn‚Äôt really open up. Kinda stays closed and wondering if that‚Äôs from swelling
