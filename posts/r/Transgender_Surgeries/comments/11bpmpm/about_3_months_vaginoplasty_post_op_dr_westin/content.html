I did the penile inversion method. doctor promised a depth of 5 to 6 cm.. however with the dilation, I get a maximum of 10 cm. all because I was circumcised. I was offered a graft from the scrotum, but I refused because of the risk of having necrosis. I was a little sorry for not having done the graft, but now it&#39;s gone.

I&#39;ve not heard of Dr Westin before. Do you have a link to this surgeon, or full name/address or city?
</p>
<p>
Is 6cm the maximum depth your surgeon offers?

in my country the plan is obliged to cover the surgery, but I didn&#39;t want to cover it. it only covered the hospital costs. I will have to go to court to have the costs of the fees reimbursed

I spent $7676.95 or 40,000 reais in Brazilian currency. He requires a psychiatrist&#39;s report. there is no waiting line, it is in accordance with the surgeon&#39;s agenda. the post-operative period was very calm, I went back to work after 1 month at home, although after 2 weeks I went out a little. I didn&#39;t have any complications. I highly recommend him, he is super attentive. He gave his number and whenever I need I talk to him. are you adm of the group?

5 / 6 cms is only 2.5&#34; that&#39;s really shallow.  You sure they don&#39;t promise 5 to 6 inches?  I get 6.5 inches now (16.5cms) 7 months after PIV.
