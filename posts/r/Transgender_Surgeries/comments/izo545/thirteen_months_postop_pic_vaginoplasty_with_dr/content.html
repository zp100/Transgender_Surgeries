I&#39;m about 7 months post from Avanassian. I love it. My labia minora is still taking shape through healing, but have absolutely no regrets going with her.

Thank you! And sure thing!

I go more in depth on the specifics of the method I&#39;m some other posts, but it&#39;s inversion with peritoneal graft.

<p>
Yep! It all has lots of feeling haha

Looks great, I had my surgery with her a couple months ago.  Did you do anything to help the scars heal?  Looks like they&#39;re completely gone

I didn&#39;t know that was a thing... Is there anything lasers can&#39;t do? Lol
</p>
<p>
Does that process feel similar to laser hair removal?  When I had my laser sessions down there before surgery it was almost unbearable to me

Hurts a lot more because it&#39;s burning away collagen bonds in your skin, but it isn&#39;t too too bad. They use a numbing cream. Just wait until you&#39;re fully healed to do it.

It&#39;s not the most inexpensive treatment, And if does hurt when it happens but it stops quick enough after. Just makes sure to research providers for it, go with someone reputable and experienced at using the lasers for skin resurfacing and scar treatment

Awesome thank you. I&#39;m not sure oh I might end up looking so I think scar removal would be a great idea for me.

Thank you for sharing your experience and being so open and forthcoming with answering questions. NY is a tad far for me and I&#39;m looking to use a different doctor. But your answers to questions have allowed me to have a better understanding of the procedure. Your results look fantastic and have only helped to reaffirm my decision to have the surgery myself when my body and bank account is ready lol I&#39;m so happy for you, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been a long and stressful road. Thank you again for being so brave and for sharing your experience. Stay safe! ❤❤❤❤

So happy for you! You got fantastic results. How was the over all experience? Did you stay in their facility or a nearby hotel? Or was it local for you? What, if anything, did you end up paying? I ask because this clinic is my top choice so far, but I&#39;m in NC, so it&#39;d be quite a trip/stay for me.

I stayed in an extended stay hotel for 1 month. I had some food expenses and like just regular cost of living for a month. The hotel was like 2k-3k I don&#39;t recall specifically.
</p>
<p>
I wrote more in depth in past posts but really everyone is great and it went as smoothly as possible.
</p>
<p>
Because my body heals weirdly fast I had some stubborn granulation but that seems mostly sorted now

I hadn&#39;t even thought about an extended stay yet! Glad everything went smoothly for you! My body is similar with fairly quick healing, I scar in funky ways sometimes too, so thats been a worry. Did you have any other expenses outside of the living arrangements  and food? Did you have to fly out there?

So because of corona I haven&#39;t been able to have actual sex yet, but the dialators are not made for comfort, so I definitely use lube. It&#39;s easy enough and I get to the middle of the thumb notch on the largest size one with no issues.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s definitely moisture there, regular discharge and all that. I just don&#39;t know how it would do for any extracurriculars. There&#39;s not a ton but I haven&#39;t been intimate with anyone because of the virus,  and in the past before the surgery my body reacts very differently to solo vs accompanied activity. So I don&#39;t feel confident giving a comment on that yet.
</p>
<p>
As to cleaning I&#39;m not sure strictly what sense you mean but with peritoneal surgeries the vagina supports a normal pH balance and as such can have the same bacterial biome as a cis woman so there isn&#39;t need to clean the inside out.
</p>
<p>
The outside I clean with soap like anything else haha

Do they give hotel recommendations or places to stay after surgery recommendations or can you provide any recommendations. I have a consultation for March 2021 and hope to use her as my surgeon.

How does Avenessian compare to Ting?  Because this is amazing.

I&#39;ve seen good results too - sigh.  It is what it is at this point.  I am leaning towards trying to get to Dr Bank in Thailand now.  Failing that, maybe Bluebond-Langer or Avanessian.

So I’m having really mixed feelings about Avanessian/mt Sinai. Someone recently posted some really bad reviews and a few people echoed those reviews. Ppl say things like “Avanessian is just good for FFS but not SRS”...
</p>
<p>
Hard to know who to trust, in a situation with inherently limited transparency.

I mean...I guess do you feel that Dr. Avanessian was a skilled surgeon? Obviously your results look great. I’m mostly concerned with results, the nurses can beat the shit out of me and throw  me in the dumpster for all I care. I just want a cute and functional vagina 😅

I would say she is, and her bedside manner is great altho she has an extremely busy schedule and you don&#39;t get a ton of time with her.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I would consider now that the swelling is definitely done is maybe getting a bit more labia minora going on but aside from that the only compication I&#39;ve ever had was quite a lot of granulation that&#39;s been fairly persistent but that&#39;s on my body and how it heals too aggressively. Nothing she could have done to change that from happening.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been treated locally for the most part as I don&#39;t live near NY, tho the first several treatments were all done by her. It&#39;s doing good now tho.
</p>
<p>
I was able to orgasm at 2 weeks when I was advised to give it a try with very light finger pressure making circles on the outside of the clitoral hood, thru a pad, thru panties. She was surprised it happened that quick but I was happy it did.
</p>
<p>
And tbh it&#39;s stayed just as sensitive lol.
</p>
<p>
No problems with urination or anything. Sometimes sprays around a bit but that&#39;s not really anything to worry about. I assume it&#39;s related to the lube I use when dialating covering part of the meatus because it&#39;s not an all the time sorta thing.
</p>
<p>
I had some significant soreness for like 6 to 7 months but some of that was swelling, some granulation, and some just how things go after major surgeries lol.
</p>
<p>
Anything more specific I could answer?

Only other question is how long between consult  and surgery? I have consult scheduled for January but I made the consult appt back last January. It just feels like an excruciatingly long time to wait for something this important 🙁

With the virus my timeline might be way different. I tried for a while to get their attention to set up a consult, and then when I got my doctors to start faxing letters over they finally called back in Nov 2018. My first intake was end of Feb iirc, I have the dates in another post. Then my consult with Dr. Avanessian was end of May. And the surgery was August 1 due to a timely cancellation.

Not bad healing.

Edit: hate to ask but I don&#39;t notice a clitoral. Did something happen, or is it just covered. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell the difference for the most part.

The clitoris is at the apex behind the labia, with a bit of a distinct hood beyond that. It&#39;s not visible unless I spread them.

It&#39;s very there and very works.

Thankfully my insurance changed in 2019 and paid for it. I otherwise never would have been able to afford it.

My insurance was billed like 135kUSD

That&#39;s what my quote was last year. But that doesn&#39;t include the month stay or flight there and back. I was planning on about 20k usd that&#39;s when the conversation rate was higher. Like 17800 compared to the 8000 now.

He’s somewhere around 600k baht, which is inline with all the other prices posted over the last 5+ years. I don’t know how you get 240k, with any well known Thai surgeon. This is last year

Hello! I was wondering what lube you recommend to use for dilation? Did your surgeon recommend any specific ones?

KY is generally recommended but I think that&#39;s just cause it&#39;s normal or whatever

Gotta be honest, I had a pretty bad crisis last night after looking at the results from a friend of mine.  They&#39;ve been in a long term relationship for about 7 years, so their significant other wasn&#39;t upset with anything, and thus, neither were they.
</p>
<p>
I, however, kind of... Got scared.  I didn&#39;t want to look like what I saw. It was just... Not right, not accurate.  And I know that sounds awful, but something I&#39;ve always been adamant on is being able to pass as cis if I wanted to. (Which also sounds awful, but it just... Hurts me and scares me to think of something like that.)
</p>
<p>
But you&#39;ve given me new hope.  You reminded me I&#39;ve got time, and if this is how good things look now, maybe by the time I can get surgery done things will be even better.  Thank you.

This looks just like another normal vulva and I wouldn&#39;t know the difference. Amazing!
