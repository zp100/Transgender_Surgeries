Just cuz I don&#39;t really see many people talking about large volume electrolysis, I figured I&#39;d post this and see if anyone had any questions. I had large volume electrolysis done on Saturday with Precision Hair Removal at the Zukowski Center in Wilmette IL, USA. This was done in preparation for bottom surgery (I&#39;m MtF).
</p>
<p>
Summary:
</p>
<p>
I have had about 30 hours of regular electrolysis so far, but I haven&#39;t been thrilled with the results, so I decided to take the nuclear option: large volume. Like I said I chose Precision in IL, because though I live in MA, I have family in the Chicago area who were willing to put me up. The basic idea behind large volume electrolysis is that they apply local anesthetic to the area beforehand, so there&#39;s no pain whatsoever and they go in marathon sessions. I chose to go as long as possible, which for Precision for the genital area is 6 hours.
</p>
<p>
Precision gave me my appointment time a few days ahead of time, and it landed at 5 AM. Which was awful, because I had to get up at 3:30 in order to eat an hour ahead of time per their instructions, but I managed. I got there early, and no one was there yet so I had to wait outside. Once there though they quickly let me into the room where I changed into a gown. The nurse administered topical anesthetic with lidocaine cream, which I sat with for like 10 minutes before the doctor came in and administered the anesthetic injections and an IV. Then the fun began. I was so tired and loopy from the hour and drugs that I dozed for the first few hours, but after that cramps and soreness from having to lie still in one position began to set in. After a while though there was a bathroom, snack, and water break that helped a lot with the stiffness. All told the procedure lasted 6 hours straight and we wrapped up just after 11 AM. There was no pain or discomfort from the electrolysis, and the staff were all very friendly, affirming, and polite. Though the technician performing the electrolysis (there was only the one the whole time) definitely looked like she was ready for a long break by the end.
</p>
<p>
Following the appointment I did as they instructed, applying lots of ointments and lotions, icing regularly, and taking an ibuprofen when the numbing started to wear off. That said, there wasn&#39;t much pain per se, but a lot of soreness and stiffness and omg so much swelling. So much swelling. The swelling has reduced significantly in the last few days, but the area is still pretty tender. Big blotchy bruises formed during the procedure, and have stuck around. Small scabs are starting to form here and there, but nothing significant yet.
</p>
<p>
Overall it was a really positive experience, and I would like to go back, though due to COVID and my roommates&#39; comfort levels I probably won&#39;t be able to. Though I have yet to see what the hair regrowth is like, I&#39;m hopeful that it will be minimal, because they hit each follicle twice. It was expensive, but my insurance has expressed a willingness to reimburse me for it, and honestly the general painless of it makes me feel like it was worth it. Especially since they were able to clear the whole area in one go. If there&#39;s a significant amount of regrowth, my opinion will change, but I&#39;ll post again if that happens.
</p>
<p>
That basically sums it up, if anyone has any questions feel free to ask.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Just so it&#39;s in the body and easy to find, cost was $1035 deposit then an additional $605 day of. Keep in mind this is for genitals. Face might be different.

Is this method unique to certain places, or can it be found in most places that do electrolysis ?

Most places that do electrolysis don&#39;t offer numbing injections.  So it&#39;s only certain places.  Some surgeons will also provide this service.

Any way to find places that do this? Facial laser is barely tolerable for me, I imagine genital electro would have me in tears.

I don&#39;t care for E3000. Maybe they&#39;ve changed, but back when they were E2000, they&#39;d leave the skin looking extremely rough.

I’m not sure you can avoid this if you fully clear dense hair in a single session, or even over a few days. It’s too intense. And of course people often travel for this so they want to get as much done as possible in one go to minimise the cost/trips.

What&#39;s the cost? Which insurance company plan do you have? BCBS, by any chance? I have BCBS and I&#39;d love to get this done, but unless i know for sure they&#39;d reimburse me for it, I don&#39;t think I could afford it.

Reach out to your insurance company and ask. I know BCBS has considered covering things like this in the past. I have a smaller, local health insurance though. I&#39;ve had to do some arm twisting to get them to do this for me, so expect that.
</p>
<p>
Oh and cost was $1035 deposit then an additional $605 day of. It&#39;s expensive, but for me the lack of pain was worth it.

I&#39;m aware of this, yes. Like I said I&#39;m hoping for minimal regrowth, but I fully plan on visiting Precision another two times or resuming regular, smaller appointments locally for the next few months before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Also 100 hrs is a huge amount of time for genital hair removal. My understanding of what&#39;s common, and what I&#39;m aiming for, is closer to 50. I will have done about 50 by the time of surgery and I&#39;m fairly confident that I&#39;ll be ready.

Ah you lucky duck. I have super light hair down there, so I have to go 100% electrolysis. IPL wouldn&#39;t even scratch the surface. Which is a real pain since it&#39;s so time consuming and expensive.

$1035 deposit then an additional $605 day of. Pricing might be different for face. It&#39;s expensive, but for me the lack of pain was worth it. Though I might not have risked it financially if my insurance wasn&#39;t (probably) going to reimburse for it.

Will do! Oh also in regard to your question about going local, I do have a local electrologist who does regular appointments, but there&#39;s no one I know of in state that does large volume with numbing injections.

Thanks for the helpful info.  I have been thinking of going that route.  I have a bad back and it seems that this method would be preferable to many small, but torturous sessions.
