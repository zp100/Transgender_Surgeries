Something like shaving the bone off the knuckles, to make your fingers slimmer? I used to have very cute, petite hands, but about 3 years ago they bulked up very suddenly. I&#39;d be perfectly willing to deal with any risks.
</p>
<p>
Have started HRT, but its too late for it to really help the size of my hands. I&#39;m more dysphoric about them than probably any other aspect of my body.

Short answer: no, there are no surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Long answer: you can&#39;t shave bones at the ends where all the ligaments and tendons attach and form the joint.
</p>
<p>
Theoretically if you have very
<em>
long
</em>
fingers you could shorten them by removing small sections of each bone in the middle, but that would probably make your hands look
<em>
more
</em>
masculine.
</p>
<p>
In addition, your hands would be covered with scars and the recovery would be both painful and inconvenient. You&#39;d have to do one hand, immobilize it, let it heal
<em>
completely
</em>
(including a long period of physical rehabilitation, and then do the other.
</p>
<p>
If
<strong>
anything
</strong>
screwed up, you&#39;d lose feeling in the hand  or possibly even the ability to grasp or manipulate. No responsible surgeon will do this.

It&#39;s the internal scar tissue that would be the worry, it could restrict movement quite a bit.

Yes, but you are also going to have to shorten the metacarpals as well as the phalanges and hiding scars in the palm or back of the hand won&#39;t be as easy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve
<em>
still
</em>
got an obvious scar from my carpal tunnel release surgery performed by an experienced
<em>
plastic
</em>
surgeon. Granted that was 35 years ago and &#34;state of the art&#34; has progressed some since then.

Is there anything that can really be done, hand wise, to make them look more feminine? They cause me so much distress looking at/feeling everyday, and used to be so dainty.

Longer nails is the only thing I&#39;ve found. Rings just draw attention to them. Dieting doesn&#39;t really help either and any exercises are just going to make the situation worse. Gloves maybe ðŸ˜‰

One thing you can do is fat transfer to the hands. That may help them seem less boney if that&#39;s a concern.

Either way, what distinguishes feminine hands is mostly finger length, wrist circumference, and (usually) a lack of scars and calluses.  Adding fat would add thickness.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think it would work, but I&#39;d be interested to see.
