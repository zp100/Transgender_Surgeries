I successfully worked at Amazon for 6 months in order to leverage their comprehensive insurance to get FFS, BA, and then had SRS in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
FFS - Dr. Jordan Deschamps Braly, San Francisco - Quoted between 60-70K Insurance paid in full. September 2021
</p>
<p>
BA - Dr. Sarah Mess, Columbia MD - Quoted 7.4K Insurance reimbursed full amount.
<br>
January 2022
</p>
<p>
SRS- DR. Banks (Chayamote Chyangsu), Suporn Clinic Chonburi Thailand. quoted 575K THB (at the time exchange rate was .030THB per 1USD) making the total 17.25K USD
<br>
This one was more complex I had to get prior approval for a &#34;foreign surgical placeholder&#34;, take a 18KUSD loan to pay up front then submit reimbursement documentation after surgery.
<br>
In the end Aetna reimbursed me 17K USD.
<br>
March 2022.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I will say I had to be relentless and push Aetna around in a couple instances where they were operating on false information. such as denying network exception for Deschamps Braly due to in network FFS surgeons capable to perform the surgeries in my area. I disproved this by calling each surgeon they listed at got confirmation that they had no idea what type III forehead contouring was.
<br>
Basically all of the documentation, sentiment, and assistance within the insurance system is meant to confuse you and discourage you from seeking coverage/reimbursement. Don&#39;t let them push you around, get angry, submit appeals/complaints, ask to speak with the supervisor, push HARD.
</p>
<p>
Any if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask!

This is really exciting!!! How’d you get past the lack of an itemized breakdown for the Suporn Clinic?

I sent them the overall pricing sheet that listed everything that was included in the price, and a letter explaining that Thailand tax system does not require itemization so asking for an itemized bill was unrealistic as that cost it&#39;s not tracked in the surgeons system due to lump sum payments to the hospital for nursing, room and board, and theater time. that was good enough for them.

I wonder if they care at all that it’s cheaper than the USA?

I&#39;m not really sure what their reasoning was. I did highlight that the surgical cost by my election to go to Thailand was much cheaper. However, Aetna is pretty low communication on their reasoning for things denial or approval so I can only guess.

To answer whoever just commented and deleted for everyone else.

<p>
Another user commented:
</p>
<p>
&#34;Insurance isn&#39;t available day 1 at and Amazon?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Yes I had insurance on day 1 but still required pre-approval for FFS and that took around 2 months to procure after my start date with near daily communication with Aetna.
</p>
<p>
I also had 3 surgeries covered that each have their own long recovery time before you can safely undergo anesthesia again. I prioritized my surgery timeline based on what would have the most impact on the next surgery and could get everything done while maintaining coverage.
</p>
<p>
FFS required 6 month recovery before I could safely undergo anesthesia again, both due to not being able to have an oxygen mask over the bridge of my nose and possible brain cell loss due to frequent anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
BA required 3 month recovery before anesthesia, I specifically waited 3 months because I wanted my upper body to be near full strength for bottom surgery recovery.

Hello so I’m going to be working at Amazon soon and will be taking this route for FFS with Deschamps.  You said you called every doctor to disapprove their claims but did you you have to provide any documentation for this, and if so, how did you retrieve it.  Sorry if this is too much.  I would greatly appreciate how you made it all happen.  I’m not the best at being so assertive so any tips where I can avoid being given the run around would be so helpful and I’m sure to others who are looking to go to him. Thanks sm  :)

This is the hard part, at this point my FFS was preauthorized with DB but with him listed as an Out of Network surgeon based on their assertion that there were surgeons that could perform the surgery within 30 miles of my home address . So I had a list of the CPT codes that were preauthorized by Aetna. I called each doctor that they stated was able to perform FFS in network in my area and 1 by 1 asked if they could perform a specific CPT code. Most of the doctors were not willing to give any documentation stating what they could and cannot do. So I made an excel spreadsheet listing the CPT codes vertically and the surgeons horizontally and wrote down their responses to each CPT and their breadth of experience for each CPT code. I included the all of their direct contact information and provided that to the LEAD of the &#34;Special medical claims&#34; team.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
for context Aetna stated that there were 3 surgeons in network that could perform FFS and that Aetna had called each surgeon and verfied that they could perform these surgeries(They Lied).
</p>
<p>
1st surgeon they listed did not work with insurance at all unless you were a breast cancer patient looking for reconstructive mammoplasty and that&#39;s the only thing they were in network for. They refused to converse with me at all about what they could and could not do, and hung up on me several times. eventually I wore them down by calling over and over and stating that their refusal to work with transgender patients in the way they work with ciswomen is a form of discrimination. I told them if they would give me a simple response on each CPT code I would leave them alone.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
2nd surgeon: Their staff was more accommodating as they were willing to work with trans patients but the surgeon did not have any breadth of knowledge or experience on forehead contouring or the actual physical measurements that go into feminizing facial features. He had a general knowledge of cosmetic surgery and was making broad generalizations about what feminization was that wasn&#39;t correct.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
3rd surgeons was 115 miles away and I immediately disqualified them on the basis of network adequacy. The ACA requires Qualified Health Plans be adequate to serve their enrollees meaning specialty care must be within your immediate area(a radius of 30 miles from your home address). since Aetna is a employer supplied plan this does not apply. However Aetna has implemented a self imposed network adequacy rule of 30 miles from home address. When I presented this to the initial special claims nurse case manager she stated &#34;Well your preferred surgeon is 10 times further away from you&#34;.  I simply responded &#34;provider choice is imperative due to your networks failure to include qualified surgeons in my area&#34;.

That said 1 tactic you can use if it is feasible and doesn&#39;t cause too much burden is to makes sure that your home address is 30 miles outside of any cosmetic surgeon that performs facial surgeries at the time of enrollment in your medical plan.

Insurance paid for your FFS with DB, that&#39;s amazing! How did you find it? Would you recommend him? (I&#39;m not from the US so I would need to win the lottery to afford him, but ya never know lol).

I&#39;ve been at Amazon for 2 months and I was told day one you are insured. You can go to an appointment and you can get it taken care of after you sign up for insurance

Thank you for this post. I’m fighting with Blue Shield of CA for my 53k Ffs a year ago, that I had to pay out of pocket. I’ve hired legal aid of OC to attorney to help me fight this. Thank you 🙏🏻. So reassuring to hear that it’s possible. The notion that other “in network” surgeons are available in my area is ridiculous. You have to work with the best you can get. 😘😘😘

Keep fighting!!! it&#39;s unfortunate that insurance companies will do everything in their power to deny coverage and I fear they will become emboldened to do so with more and more anti trans legislation being thrown around and passed in sham medical board proceedings.

Hey, I realize this is a fairly old post, but I’m considering doing the same thing (working at Amazon) and I had a couple of questions. 1. How much total time did you have to take off work for the three procedures and recovery? 2. Did Amazon/HR/your supervisor give you a hard time or make it difficult to take the time off?  3. Does Amazon have paid medical leave, or did you just have money saved up to pay the bills while you weren’t able to work?

Hi!!
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
FFS - 6 weeks off (short term disability)  BA - 6 weeks off (short term disability)  SRS- 12 weeks recovery in Thailand(I had already quit Amazon)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I literally never spoke to my supervisor any hr in person and had no pushback. I worked in a warehouse packing orders for shipment and the scheduling work model there is 100% digital and automated. You place a leave request for medical and supply for short term disability in the employee app and a corporate hr rep in Seattle will call you to set it all up and complete w questions.  My supervisor couldn&#39;t CARE less if I was there and didn&#39;t even really know my name. As long as he had a body to put at that station he was good and Amazon routinely over hires in many warehouse to blanket employee outages.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I was on short term disability(%60 of weekly income is paid out) for both ffs and BA.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
SRS was different I had quit Amazon and went back to engineering as a contractor which allowed me to stay on Amazons insurance plan through cobra. I made well over 3x what Amazon was paying me so paying the full price for the health insurance plan wasn&#39;t an issue and I used that income to cover my stay in Thailand. That said Amazons employee help line(phone call) is super good at helping with these things as long as your up front and comfortable with talking about the issue and asking your options.

Ok that depends, are your surgeons submitting the pre-authorization request? If so you should check back with your surgeon to ensure that they&#39;ve submitted it to Aetna or to check it there is anything else they need for submittal. Your surgeon has no say in pre-authorizations other than a burden to prove that your surgery is medically necessary and to submit the pre-authorization to Aetna. This is also not called a claim. A claim is has a distinct definition in the insurance realm of a submittal by your surgeon for payment or submittal on your own behalf for reimbursement when you have paid for services up front and out of pocket.
</p>
<p>
You likely won&#39;t get any response from Aetna when the pre-authorization is received by them, only when they make a decision which could take weeks to months.
</p>
<p>
Pre-authorizations also will not show up in the claims section as a pre-authorization is not a claim. You will get an email that states you have a new message regarding pre-authorization claims. The site will guide you to were you can view the message and there will be a PDF attachment that states denial or approval. Be sure to save your pdfs in a location where you have access to them from your own computer.

I am in Seattle, Washington and trying to figure out which insurance to get that will cover FFS with FacialTeam in Spain (already booked). For SRS I also want to go to Suporn Clinic, but have not made any concrete plans. Unfortunately I am not able to get any benefits from my job so I have to pay out of pocket for an insurance plan (Medicaid in WA is terrible, I&#39;ve been unable to get what I need for 5 months). Most people recommend Premera... but I just don&#39;t know what to do. Is that Aetna plan for Amazon employees only?

<p>
yes the Aetna plan is modeled for Amazon specifically.
</p>
<p>
To clarify I am actually a electrical mechanical engineer and work in aerospace/robotics. I left my high paying engineering job to work for Amazon as a box packer to get what I needed as the savings I had for working for amazon for 6 months was nearly 100K.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, 5 months is a really short time to be seeking comprehensive insurance. In 2014 when I started transition there were practically no insurance plans that would cover even bottom surgery. I had to fight with my employer at the time(an aerospace coatings supplier in Vermont) to even add coverage for HRT/Labs/Therapy as they had an exclusion for &#34;congenital transsexualism&#34; whatever the fuck that means. I have been fighting insurance plans from employers in engineering ever since. From full on exclusions to &#34;cosmetic surgery&#34; exclusions. Weigh your options. Amazon Aetna will almost certainly cover FacialTeam considering their plan has a statement to cover international surgeries that would be covered through the plan domestically.

I would def submit a claim for reimbursement for your BA. I went to an out of network surgeon and got fully reimbursed by my insurance. It was however pre-authorized as out of network provider.

It was pre authorized but the denied the gap coverage for being out of network because local surgeons. My doctor and I are still claiming it though. We need to start a trans Amazon surgical group. It’s hard to find info. Starbucks has one on fb which was helpful when I was employed by them.

Did you have to provide Aetna with CPT codes? I’m about to start the prior authorization process with them for the Suporn Clinic and could use any information regarding what they required from you.

How old are you? How did you learn how to do all this? I feel like I’m a fairly intelligent 26 year old but this just made me feel absolutely worthless. I wish I knew how to do this, becuase if I knew how to talk through it all, get a job and work at Amazon, get all of that covered, it would literally save my life. And all I do is suffer. Where do you get taught to push and navigate through the insurance system like that? I’m so jealous of you, you literally have done and lived through my dream surgically goals and I wanna cry

Hi there!
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t be discouraged. It took a long time to get here. I came out at 26 and started hrt then but I am 37 now and didn&#39;t get any of these surgeries until I was 35. I learned slowly over the course of 10 years dealing with the system.  The first insurance plan I had when I started transitioning wouldn&#39;t even cover hrt and so I had to educate myself on how to push back against them and save my own life.
</p>
<p>
I put in a ton of work  and countless hours dealing with different insurance plans over the years and research time learning how insurance works and how they use terms in their plans to discourage people from trying to get coverage.
</p>
<p>
There are some good resources for learning and utilizing that I will link in a reply below.

One thing I haven&#39;t mentioned, I didn&#39;t do anything special or have a high level job at Amazon I packed boxes with orders for shipment in a warehouse for 17$/hr. There was no interview process I applied online and was immediately hired electronically(never talked to a single human) Insurance started day 1.
</p>
<p>
Before going to Amazon for their insurance I was a quality engineer for a robotics company but the robotics companies insurance wouldn&#39;t cover ffs so I decided to make ALOT less money per hr at Amazon but get good coverage.

I’m legitimately considering doing something like this. That is absolutely nuts. Gotta have to fight tooth and nail for it with Aetna afterwards too it seems, but would be SO worth it
