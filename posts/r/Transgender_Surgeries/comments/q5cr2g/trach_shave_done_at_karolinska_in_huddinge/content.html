Looks great. I&#39;m planning having it done soon, so scared. Was it really painful for you? Were you able to eat/swallow afterwards?

It was like.. tylenol level of pain. So very managable. The first thing I ate was some Thai chicken dish which hurt like a fuck. 0/10 would not recomend doing that 2 hours after being intubated. The day after I could eat just fine, it was like weirdly uncomfortable to swallow for a while. Maybe 3 weeks

I just had mine done about a week ago. Surprisingly not painful like OP, I had like a day or two of a headache. I&#39;m still being careful, though

Thanks for sharing your experience, glad to hear it went so well for you. I guess it really does depend on each individual, and how we deal post op.

If you look at second picture, scar is very faded after 11 months. I notice it sometimes because I know it is there, I dont think other people see it

thanks tons posting...
</p>
<p>
i will have mine done in finland in a month or two.  was hoping they&#39;d do the incision just under the jaw (so its not noticeable), but they do the operation in similar fashion.  Doctor told me the scar isn&#39;t noticeable unless you know its there, but he had no pictures to show what he meant
</p>
<p>
so i have much more peace now, thanks :)
</p>

(and i read from below *not* to eat Thai chicken after ;) :) )

I wished mine was under my jaw, but the doctors who I could see did the same incision, which feels sufficient. I asked them to go higher &amp; travel the incision further if possible &amp; they did a little bit.

oh, yes, it is a bit a ways above where the adam&#39;s apple used to be (and they did a real nice job with that)... i hadn&#39;t realized how far up they did go.
</p>
<p>
scar so unnoticeable that going higher with the incision doesn&#39;t seem to make much difference (and perhaps cutting where they did made the surgery and healing a bit easier? idk)

Cutting high means larger internal wound, more risk for tissue adhesion.

I see! I base my statement on asking my surgeon and my experience tending to post op patients for a living. But I could ofcourse be wrong since wordsay and experience are my only sources :)

It was some surgeon at Karolinska. You&#39;d not be able to choose surgeons anyway, so does it matter?  You can tell anova you want a tracheal shave and they might refer you, I have no experience with Anova. I waited about 5 months I think. 12 in total if you count the 7 months I waited in Ume√• before they stopped doing this surgery there.

Is easy. It was mostly annoying to have suture strips and then tape on my throat for serveras months to keep the scar tight. Other than that it was no biggie.

May I please know will that affect your singing range?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm a singer, and was considering vocal feminisation surgery but give up as I don‚Äôt want my singing voice being limited into very certain range.
</p>
<p>
How about trach shave, will that affect your speaking or singing rage. My voice is my only source of income, I can rest for few month, but I‚Äôm scared it will long term affect my voice. Could that be myself worrying too much for trach shave?  Thank you for your help with this, sister üòä

I don&#39;t think it would. I can&#39;t sing to begin with, so I wouldn&#39;t know from experoemce. I Can se no mechanical reason why it would hinder it as long as there is no complication like cracks in the cartilage or infection
