Hello again all!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m writing this post up specifically to talk about how I got to my surgery date and my experiences between Dr. Ramineni and his office, my insurance, and GWU Hospital. I&#39;ve posted a gallery of pictures of my results and recovery from 1-4.5 weeks earlier, but this post won&#39;t have any pictures in it - just a text review of the process and care I received.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Back to the Beginning
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I was a young child... nah, jk. Not going that far back.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been in therapy for gender identity questions since 2019, with a small spurt earlier in my college years (before I knew what nonbinary even was!) When I started therapy back then, I
<em>
knew
</em>
I wanted breasts - this culminated in getting top surgery (breast augmentation) in March of 2022 - and I had complicated thoughts about my genitals. For a time, I had wanted and explored the idea of having both sets of genitals, but over time realized that the only reason I had any attachment to my penis was because it was familiar and not because I wanted it.
</p>
<p>
After my top surgery, things felt really quiet for a while. I was absolutely over the moon with my chest (and still am), but that euphoria managed to drown out the bottom dysphoria for a while. When a close masc NB friend of mine had vaginoplasty themselves earlier this year in Feburary, the dam broke and I felt that deep seeded discomfort with my genitals return. So I worked with my therapist to start the process toward vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Searching for a Surgeon
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I took a long time to narrow down my list, especially using the wiki here on this subreddit. Eventually, I narrowed things down to Dr. Praful Ramineni (DC), Dr. Rachel Bluebond-Langner (NY), Dr. Toby Meltzer (AZ), and Drs. Jaromir Slama and Robert Oates (MA). I eventually ruled out Meltzer due to distance and Bluebond-Langner due to wait times vs. results (just that I did not feel her results, which are excellent, warranted waiting 3+ years for me, ymmv). I had consultations with Dr. Ramineni over the phone and Dr. Oates in person. Both were wonderfully professional, but I found it difficult to get far with Boston Medical Center in getting a consultation with Dr. Slama (this was the recommended course of action by NP Pam Klein, who is absolutely fabulous). This was a disappointment, since I have gone to BMC for
<em>
everything
</em>
over the last few years, including my primary care. It did also make me realize that the primary reason for keeping BMC on the short list was because it is conveniently close and in my insurance network. Ultimately, those weren&#39;t good enough reasons to keep them on the list. (It was also incredibly difficult to find any healed examples of BMC&#39;s work, on here or elsewhere. Furthermore, Dr. Oates made it clear to me that he would likely retire before my surgery, but I had not met the other urology surgeon, which made me somewhat uncomfortable with the prospect.)
</p>
<p>
So I chose to go with Dr. Ramineni and District Plastic Surgery in DC. I found his hybrid PIV method appealing - he uses a standard PIV except he leaves the end of the canal open and anchored to the underside of the peritoneum, giving some extra depth and lubrication without abdominal surgery like PPV. I also found his lack of hair removal requirement to be helpful, as I
<em>
very
</em>
much enjoy my hairiness. After some consultation with other medical professionals on the scrape and cauterization method, I was reassured that it would be adequate. Dr. Ramineni himself was also
<em>
incredibly
</em>
kind and prompt to answer any and all questions I had, often emailing me a response within an hour or two. He never spoke down to me or tried to speak above my head with medical terminology, instead breaking down concepts into language that I could understand without insulting my intelligence. He was also very willing to accommodate my request to have a larger clitoris.
</p>
<p>
The biggest problem, then, was getting my insurance to cover everything.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Insurance
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have a Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA HMO through my employer, with a network set exclusively to the New England states, making my preferred surgeon very much out of network. What&#39;s rather wonderful about my insurance company, however, is that they have a transgender healthcare hotline where you are connected to a higher level claims agent that actually knows and has experience with helping trans patients navigate their insurance benefits. I had used this service very late toward my top surgery, but immediately reconnected with the agent I had then. She passed me along to someone new and she has been a
<em>
literal godsend
</em>
since.
</p>
<p>
I had to fill out an Out of Network Managed Care Request form, which took quite some time, but I managed alright. I also had a hell of a time getting coverage set up for sperm banking through CryoChoice, since they don&#39;t work with insurance. Still, my insurance has at least covered half of the sperm banking and is currently reviewing my request to cover the remainder. Blue Cross of MA also updated their transgender healthcare policy to better align with WPATH SOC v.8 (though not completely), meaning that I still need two letters of support, but they could be from any provider, not just mental health providers. I ended up sending in my claim with a letter from my therapist (LICSW, master&#39;s level) and my PCP. They also removed the hormone requirement, which was perfect because I have no desire to use any feminizing hormones, before or after surgery.
</p>
<p>
In September, when I called to register as a patient at GWU Hospital, they did ask me to pay $2000 - the amount of my deductible. As I knew I had already paid toward my deductible quite a bit and would have all of it covered before surgery, I refused.
<strong>
IMPORTANT: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY AHEAD OF TIME.
</strong>
In fact, I
<em>
highly
</em>
recommend you don&#39;t, as they are essentially asking you to pay an estimate of your costs. If I had paid that $2000, I would have had to get a refund from GWU for $2000... and once they have your money, getting it back is
<em>
much
</em>
harder.
</p>
<p>
In the couple of weeks leading up to surgery, they kept things
<em>
really
</em>
close to the wire by not approving the surgery until two days before I left - but it was approved! No appeals needed, just some gentle (and very persistent) nudging from me!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The Surgery and Hospital Stay
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s where the juicy stuff is!
</p>
<p>
I traveled down to DC using the Amtrak Acela with my mother on Saturday, 10/21. We were going to stay with family just outside DC who would also be taking care of me once my mother left after discharge from the hospital.
</p>
<p>
The day before surgery was definitely the worst part of prep, as I was no longer allowed to eat and had to do some bowel prep with a bottle of magnesium citrate. It wasn&#39;t required that I
<em>
completely
</em>
clean out, but I got pretty close. Jello cups get
<em>
really
</em>
gross after the third or so one you &#34;eat.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Day of surgery was pretty smooth. Check in was rather easy and they made no fuss of me having &#34;not paid&#34; ahead of time, as I mentioned before. I was taken to pre-op and got ready with the nursing and anesthesia team.
</p>
<p>
The gown they gave me was lined in plastic and it just made me SWEAT. This was only compounded once anesthesia arrived to place the epidural catheter in my back.
</p>
<p>
Getting the epidural placed is a feeling that is hard to describe. &#34;Pain&#34; isn&#39;t quite right, as it&#39;s more &#34;pressure,&#34; but
<em>
very
</em>
intense. Others have spoken about how this was the panic moment that made them rethink everything - I absolutely agree. I didn&#39;t have doubts at this point, but I can certainly say that I almost passed out as they were inserting from the sensation alone.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ramineni came in to check on me and we talked one last time about my aesthetic goals - mostly to clarify that I wanted a large clitoris, but not too large that it was exposed! After that, I was wheeled into the OR, strapped down, and put to sleep!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hospital Stay - Night 0 and Day 1
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I woke up in recovery, I was in pain and thirsty. It was a bit hard to get a nurse&#39;s attention, but once I did she helped with pain meds and water immediately. This is where some of the problems began. I was in the recovery area for a while as I was waiting for a room to open up - during this time, there seemed to be a group of nurses outside my curtain the whole time just chatting, but I
<strong>
could not
</strong>
seem to get their attention unless I made a pretty big fuss. At some point, one of them helped me remove the plastic lined gown, but didn&#39;t give me a new patient gown to wear... so I was just naked from this point forward (not even kidding - until day 3, just the surgical dressings).
</p>
<p>
Eventually a room was found and I was wheeled up into the ward. It was right over a nurse shift change and just as the kitchens were about to close, so I ordered a PB&amp;J. After bowel prep, it was the best goddamn sandwich I&#39;ve ever had.
</p>
<p>
The nurse I had that night (shoutout to Michelle!) was
<em>
amazing
</em>
. She spent time with me, was incredibly clear about what pain meds I could take and when, was very prompt with said pain meds when I asked for them, and made sure I had ice packs to spare. She told me at one point that she&#39;s helped several patients through this surgery recovery and that ice during the first 24 hours is the most important bit to keep bleeding down. She had 3 ice packs beneath me and 2 on top of me at all times and it felt
<em>
amazing
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
The next morning is where things started to deteriorate. The nurse shift changed over and I ordered breakfast - French toast and veggie sausage. It was pretty much exactly what I expect from institutional food - kinda soggy and just &#39;okay.&#39; It felt a lot more like &#39;sustenance&#39; than &#39;food.&#39; This really was the case for all the food I ordered from here on out, which I specifically mention only because I&#39;ve seen others praise the food at GWU Hospital. I&#39;m not sure if I just ordered the wrong things or if it&#39;s just a YMMV thing, but it&#39;s worth a mention!
</p>
<p>
My new nurse seemed pressed right off the bat. I admit that I&#39;m still not sure if she was just uncomfortable with me as a patient or if she is just like that in general. I also know that there was a patient around the corner from me that was having a
<em>
real
</em>
rough time - as in coding every couple of hours or so. I
<em>
also
</em>
know that the healthcare field as a whole is struggling with personnel right now. With all that being said - this nurse did not do a good job keeping my pain down. She was often completely unresponsive to calls and didn&#39;t make it clear at all when medications could be taken. When I did get ahold of her and asked for medication, she would respond with &#34;10 minutes,&#34; but then 30-40 minutes would go by before she showed up. Oftentimes, this meant that if I called when my pain was hitting 4-5 and rising, by the time she arrived I was then hitting 7-8 and needed higher dosages to keep pain in check.
</p>
<p>
I have to put a shoutout in here for the med tech I had during days 1 and 2 (along with this nurse). The med tech - who was weirdly also an RN - sometimes filled in for the nurse and administered medications in a much more timely manner. She was also much more patient to explain what was going on at any given time and help me understand ways to help my caregivers so they could help me better.
</p>
<p>
That night, I had a totally new nurse and she was amazing again. On top of everything, very kind and warm, and made a point to include me in the shift change report (something that the day nurse repeatedly neglected to do).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 2
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Day 2 was rather similar to day 1 with the same day nurse I had before. I struggled to get her attention and my pain levels repeatedly went out of control. We made attempts to standardize care a bit more - I was told how often my pain meds could be distributed and we kept track of it on the whiteboard in the room. Since we both knew she would have to take some time to get to me with meds, I made it a point to call ~30 minutes in advance of my next dose. Throughout all of this, I did my best to be as nice and agreeable as possible, since I was now getting the distinct vibes that I was at least on her nerves, if not an &#39;inconvenience&#39; at this point.
</p>
<p>
It was all in vain.
</p>
<p>
I still had runaway pain. I still barely saw my nurse. I still hardly could get in contact with her throughout the day. The med tech still had to stand in more frequently. At one point the charge nurse came in to ask me how my stay was going and a few questions about how my nursing team was doing. I had to be frank (though I tried my best to be kind and understanding of situations happening outside my room, like the coding patient). There were several times that I was in tears because of the pain with no support or medication on the way because no one would answer the phone. At least at one point, I was connected to a completely unrelated unit in the hospital because I had called so many times - they relayed a message by hand to my care team when I made it clear that I hadn&#39;t been able to contact anyone.
</p>
<p>
At some point during this day, I had my first PT session and was able to get up and walk around. This was after the epidural catheter was removed (which I was both thankful and rueful for - see the pain above!) Moving was hard, but not impossible, and I didn&#39;t push myself at all - just down the hallway and back. I finally got to brush my teeth!
</p>
<p>
The night brought another amazing nursing team that was highly responsive and very compassionate. I was absolutely exhausted from the day filled with pain and walking about, so I got lots of sleep. Unfortunately, it was only ever in hour long spurts, as I was woken by floor cleaning at
<em>
every single hour
</em>
. I still don&#39;t understand what needed to be cleaned THAT much outside my door (and it was JUST outside my door the whole night).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 3 and Discharge
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Finally, the day shift came and a new day nurse with it. He was very kind, though a bit abrupt. At this point, I had a lot less pain and was more focused on being able to get discharged so I could have some
<em>
real food, damnit
</em>
. I had another PT session to help me with stairs - it was actually much easier than I thought it would be! I also had a pelvic PT session to help me with dilation later. This was a lot more &#39;theoretical,&#39; as she mostly just talked to me. It also didn&#39;t help that I knew a lot of what she was telling me, since I&#39;m a classically trained oboist. Deep, pelvic breathing is something I was taught a lot about and I had been practicing Kegels ahead of surgery specifically for this purpose. Still, she was kind and helpful!
</p>
<p>
I saw the discharge nurse and was able to get the hell out - ironically running into the hospital CEO and some of the Board of Directors in the elevator on the way down. I am
<em>
so
</em>
glad she didn&#39;t ask me how my stay was, because I do not think she would have liked the answer...
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Followup and Dilation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exactly one week following surgery, I had my followup appointment with Dr. Ramineni at his office. This went rather smoothly and I think I had a pretty typical experience. I won&#39;t go too into details, but the stitch and packing were removed - this was rather uncomfortable and I did have to ask him to stop at one point because of pain. It didn&#39;t take too long, though, and then he demonstrated dilation (and my depth). I did have to ask him to stop pushing at one point, because it got a little painful, but he wasn&#39;t holding the purple SoulSource dilator in for long at all, mostly just to demonstrate the stretching feeling I would be looking for when I dilated.
</p>
<p>
I had one more followup later that week before I flew back up to New England where he told me that everything was looking great! For the rest of my story, check my weeks 1-4.5 post from yesterday!
</p>
<p>
I
<em>
think
</em>
that&#39;s everything. If there are any questions, of course, I&#39;ll do my best to answer them! Overall, I think GWU Hospital is a pretty good facility, but I think I just got unlucky. Exactly how - nurse was too busy, nurse was maybe a little enbyphobic - I honestly don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t mean to write this to dissuade people from going there for any healthcare needs, but I did want to present my honest recollection of my experience as a patient there. It wasn&#39;t fun and I certainly hope it isn&#39;t that bad for anyone else!

Happy to help! It basically just added an extra layer to the approval process, since the approval needed to be approved first! 🤣
</p>
<p>
I got a notice of approval about a week and a half before surgery, but was told that was just the &#34;out of network care&#34; approval - pretty much an agreement between my surgeon and the insurance company. Then they actually worked on approval for the surgery itself, which is what came in so close to my surgery date.

I&#39;m glad it worked out for you. I&#39;m in the same situation, I want to present as male but I don&#39;t know how my insurance is going to feel about that. Keep us up to date on your healing.

Thank you so much for this information. I’m scheduled with Dr. Ramineni for the same surgery in April. Do you think you might have had less issues with another surgeon? Would you still recommend him after all you’ve been through. Are you ultimately happy with your new vagina? Thank you again.

I do still recommend him!
</p>
<p>
The complications I have had are all minor ones and wouldn&#39;t have been avoided with a different surgeon - it&#39;s mostly just bad luck!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with my vagina and while I still have some issues, I&#39;m still much happier than I was before. It&#39;s a small tradeoff to have a sucky couple of months in exchange for a lifetime of happiness!
</p>
<p>
I also want to add that I saw your recent post over in
<a href="/r/ftm">r/ftm
</a>
and am rather disappointed by the response you got. Even if it wasn&#39;t the right place (which is not for me to say, being AMAB myself), it shouldn&#39;t be hard to offer support in finding a more helpful online support community. I&#39;m sorry you had to deal with it and would like to offer
<a href="/r/AMABwGD">r/AMABwGD
</a>
- there are many people who are assigned male at birth there with similar questions, explorations, and experiences of dysphoria that might be able to help you!

I can’t begin to tell you how  happy I am to have received your response on two important counts: 1. I really like Ramineni and he’s been so accessible in answering all my questions in an incredibly timely and kind manner. I’ve seen a lot of his work and it looks great. I’m scheduled April 9 with him for vaginoplasty and I’m so excited and nervous. 2.  I’m still in shock from some of those ftm group comments so I really appreciate your kind words.
