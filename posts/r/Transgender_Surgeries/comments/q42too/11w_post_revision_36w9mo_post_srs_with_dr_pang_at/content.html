Personally I would love to look down and see this results.  As for the discharge issue, I&#39;d seek out a new gyno until I found one to correctly diagnose and remedy it. It&#39;s a huge journey and a lot for your body to adjust to. Give yourself time.  Hopefully the words of support help.  Cis girls aren&#39;t always 100% happy with there appearance either.

Iâ€™m sorry for everything youâ€™ve been through, I really resonate with your experience at Mt. Sinai, down to the details and the lingering post operative feelings youâ€™ve had since your surgeries. I had surgery predominantly done with Dr. Avanessian a few years ago, and recently went back a few months ago for a revision consultation, and I have to say Iâ€™m pretty dissatisfied with my experience and results from there too. I honestly wish I never stepped foot into Mt. Sinai. While the surgeons there are nice in passing (except for maybe Dr. Ting, Iâ€™m not sure how he is as Iâ€™ve never worked with him. My surgeons were Dr. Avanessian and Dr. Pang), youâ€™re definitely not alone in your communication frustrations with them (as I am a very detail oriented person too, Iâ€™m also hyper aware of anatomical differences). My stay at the hospital was also extremely traumatizing. I also just felt like they lacked sense or compassion for certain aspects of dealing with dysphoria/mental health, I felt like when I pointed out obvious issues with my results they were essentially played down or brushed off altogether. Their program is severely fractured and Iâ€™m definitely going elsewhere for a revision.
</p>
<p>
I will say, your revision result is a definite improvement from what you had previously but I also see the issues youâ€™re concerned with. I think at this point, whatâ€™s best is that you just give your body time to heal and balance out and then taking it from there. You can always get another revision, though you may see things settle and turn out differently in the end just as your first surgery settled into itâ€™s final aesthetic. Itâ€™ll just take time. Iâ€™m sorry again youâ€™re feeling this way, and arenâ€™t satisfied. I honestly wish Mt. Sinai would stop performing these surgeries because their facilities cannot keep up. If you find in a year from now youâ€™re still wanting a revision, perhaps reach out to NYU or another team to gather second opinions. Best of luck with everything.

Ting the Butcher was my surgeon and I had the same experience back in 2017. All I can say if that I will NEVER let him touch me again! You only got 1 time to get on my bad side and screw me over and itâ€™s a wrap! My revision will be done by Rachel Bluebond at NYU

Iâ€™m a VICTIM of Mount Sinai. Dr Jess (the butcher) Ting did my SRS back in 2017. Their communication with their patients is HORRIBLE! when I was a patient of theirs getting in touch with them was damn near impossible and when it was time for my follow ups Ting barley showed his face. I was blessed enough to have met Bella (whoâ€™s a MUCH better surgeon). They pissed me off so much i will never let them touch me again! Iâ€™m scheduled for my consultation with Rachel Bluebond at NYU this coming January for SRS revision.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m sorry you had to go through this. But there is hope your results looks a THOUSAND times better than mine

personally I do not think your results look bad aesthetically! not that your concerns are invalid ofc. I have no specific advice for you re:next steps but I did want to share a more positive view of your results aesthetically because I think it&#39;s justified.

Visually I think your results look decent, but this sounds like a rough road to take to get there! If you still are not satisfied, definitely go to a different surgeon and see what they have to say.
</p>
<p>
I have to ask if you could elaborate on the pain that you have? Is it all the time? Or just with dilation?

thank you for your reply.
</p>
<p>
yes, decent, but not good. i&#39;m going to schedule a few consultations and see what they say! looking at thai surgeons as well, but that would be much less possible at the moment if ever.
</p>
<p>
as for pain, it&#39;s more like a constant discomfort because of things not being properly tensioned/held together, like when i move or reposition myself (sit/stand/etc), my vulva doesn&#39;t move properly with my body, if that makes sense? definitely true pain during dilation and sex, and most of the time when touching it at all.

Iâ€™ve been around a long time and your result is decent looking.  I agree with most of your criticisms of things that can be improved aesthetically, but Iâ€™d probably focus on the function, pain issues and odor at this point.  For the latter, check Susans Place-a lot of experience over there in our issues.  Regarding the other, surgical issues, I would probably look to a solution in Thailand.  If not there, RBBL might be anle to help with her peritoneal  graft method.   Best wishes.

thank you for your reply.
</p>
<p>
among the criticisms, do you agree that the clitoris is potentially too high, or that the labia are too long? this is the one i can&#39;t really make my mind up about.
</p>
<p>
thank you for the suggestions, i will look into resources at susan&#39;s and start doing research about thai surgeons, though actually going to thailand for surgery is not a viable option for me at the moment. i was thinking of looking into RBBL and McGinn.

Overall, given the history of srs, itâ€™s not that bad aesthetically.  I do think the labia majora could easily be made more realistic by a good, skilled surgeon.  I think the long labia/clit placement/hood is a variation not uncommon to transwomen.  Personally, I donâ€™t think it is an abnormal looking result at all.  Is it natal looking?  No, probably a bit to the left of that, but not bad either.  On the other hand, the functional problems are what I think you should prioritize.  I would check out and prioritize RBbL since she uses a peritoneal graft method.  Wishing you luck.
