Title says it all, nothing works. There&#39;s sensation down there, things feel okay, but it&#39;s like rubbing a thumb. I could orgasm before, but since my operation nothing.
</p>
<p>
Is this normal at this point? Any other experiences like this? When should I worry / start looking into wether or not they did something wrong during the operation?

Dr Wittenberg says the average time for her patients to orgasm is 8-9 months ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è seems weird that you don&#39;t have a lot of sensation yet, but nerves are still reconnecting

That‚Äôs reassuring. And yeah, there‚Äôs not no sensation. There‚Äôs just absolutely nothing special about the sensation that‚Äôs there.

I never touch myself and especially not my clit. I really focus on the moment and what excite me... I just lay on my stomach, rub my pubis on the mattress and squizz my ass/perineal muscles... I still get a really good orgasm. You have to adapt to your new body part, it&#39;s very different from before because rubbing is not the only way to get the orgasm. I remember I was so worried for about 4months that I still didn&#39;t get any orgasm and I was getting so horny that one day I had enough and it took me 3hours to get my orgasm but I still got it Ahah Now it much more easy, I know how to do it faster, you really have to learn :) I even bought at the time a vibrator because I was so worried, thinking the only way was rubbing my clit... And now I don&#39;t even use it üòÖ I hope it helped you a bit, you need time and the right time is gonna come, don&#39;t worry :)

Its a pretty intensive surgery so it will take a while. I had a lot of sensation early on now im on like a sensitivity/ numbness rollercoaster at 9 months as the nerves properly sort themselves out. Also theres the whole issue of just not even know how to operate this damned thing, theres no manual!!!!

It took me longer than four months, more like 8, but now at 12 months it can happen fairly easily.

Have you tried prostate simulation? Not many women just cum from clitoral play. Most orgasms are g spot related plus clitoras. I can basically only get off from prostate orgasms even pre op. But theyre fast and heavenly

I just passed five months ‚Äî I can get reasonably close but no O so far. I‚Äôm not impatient. I just ride the wave of the good feelings and trust it will happen.  I do have some numbness down there still, and I expect to for a while.

did your team not say you can reduce frequency?  i was told twice a day from three months and once a day from six months.  also i&#39;ve been encouraged to use fingers more for applying gel and excercising pelvic floor, so less achy making.

Different teams have different rules. There‚Äôs no great studies on what works well. I went to Ting and their recommendation is 2-3 times a day for the first year with no variation.

Check my post history, I just came for the first time 3 days ago. I am now 5 months post-op.  I thought for real that I was broken but kept trying and boom it happened. I now already orgasmed twice!
</p>
<p>
The area that feels good is more in the labia and above the clit, the clit itself feels like the tip of the penis and is not that pleasureable to touch directly.
</p>
<p>
You are not broken and it will work eventually, trust me!

Did you try to distract yourself with sexualy arousing thoughts?
</p>
<p>
I get best orgasms when I don&#39;t try to get them, and instead when I massage my vulva and delve into pleasure this massage is giving me. Then, when I reach full relaxation I get my climax, which can last for half an hour if I want.
</p>
<p>
Did you find your most erogenic spots already?
</p>
<p>
Sensation is evolving over time. There were times when my sensation was completely gone in one area while present in other, and vice-versa. When the wound is healing the nerves need to recover. The capillary network is growing and nerves reconnect in new ways. Perhaps disconnect too. So for example straight after op my sensation was outside (where penis was no longer there) and sides of my clitoris felt reversed left-right. Then over first two months sensation gone, and then it reappeared in correct arrangement left being left and right being right, depth being depth. Erogenic zones changed too. My current erogeninc zones aren&#39;t the same as in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s just best to not think too much about it, relax and wait one year, and see how over that time things change. You can still massage the area. Massage will speed up wound healing, capillary regeneration and nerve reconnection. In the meantime try to enjoy the feeling and relax.

Then watch how you speak. This idea of ‚Äúfemale genitals‚Äù is weird. Trans men don‚Äôt have ‚Äúfemale vagina‚Äù. Trans women don‚Äôt have ‚Äúmale penises‚Äù. You‚Äôre in a trans focused forum. Take the strict assignment of gender and genitals outta here. Instead of being defensive, recognize the hurt you caused and move on.

I hope no one will get sad or upset, but I&#39;m 6 weeks post op and a week ago I was able to orgasm while masturbating. I have a lot of sensitivity and all, but my clit is still a bit painful from stitches and everything.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to hold myself from masturbating more so things can heal and painful clit will be no more. Also I just want to give myself a bit more time to adjust to new body arrangement.
</p>
<p>
Relax and remember that orgasm comes from within your mind and the rest is just a helpful tool.

I was I think 4-5 mos post op before I came. But I didn‚Äôt try too many times. For me what did the trick was a vibrator in my vagina, my wetness or lube on my fingers rubbing on my clit and then the other stuff I liked pre-op (certain pics of guys, my nips stimulated, etc)
