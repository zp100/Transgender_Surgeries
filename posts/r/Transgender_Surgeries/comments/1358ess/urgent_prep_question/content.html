In many cases the surgeon tells patients not to do any hair removal and risk nicks and cuts. In these cases the nurses take care of it. This shouldn&#39;t be surgery-stopper. Just tell them what you did and that it didn&#39;t work. They will take care of it from there.

Did you do a thick layer of Nair? It took 10 minutes for me to start removing hair. You do it in the morning after using the anti-bacterial soap. For some reason the Nair made my skin bleed, but this was no concern for them.  As a last resort you’ll need to see what they say when you get there. Tell the nurse right away when you check in (not the front desk person, but the nurse checking you in inside the “broom closet”)  DM me if you have other questions.

I used a reaaaally thick layer and put it on for 15 minutes and it still didn&#39;t come off.

<p>
I&#39;ll let them know as soon as I get there
