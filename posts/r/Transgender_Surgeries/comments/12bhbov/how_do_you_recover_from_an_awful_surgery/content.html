Hi, so i&#39;ve had about a year of recovery since my first SRS with Dr Schaff in germany which probably has been the worst year in my life. I basically have completely lost the will to live in that time due to the pretty horrible results (not so much the look of my vagina, but basically everything else). So i am trying to come to terms with the fact that this is the way it will be for me going forward, and thought there might be other people who have had to do the same.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m right now about a month and a half after my revision (11 months after my first surgery), dilation hurts as much as it ever did (which is a lot, even with the smallest dilator). Combined with the fact that there are a couple of hairs growing in the canal and consistent yellowish discharge + smell, i kinda don&#39;t feel like i&#39;ll ever be comfortable having a sex life and therefore any romantic partner. So like, how do i cope with this other than the hope of eventually having my shit fixed?
</p>
<p>
Could there be a situation where this magically gets better somehow lol?
</p>
<p>
Is it reasonable to expect that my issues can be fixed in more revision surgeries?
</p>
<p>
Is it a better idea to look into something like colon SRS as a &#34;replacement&#34; for the issues?
</p>
<p>
What a sad fucking waste of my life i guess, and im sorry for bringing my grief to you guys, but i genuinely have no idea what to do now.

I am very sorry this happened to you. There’s another person on here always telling people they don’t need hair removal in Europe because the doctor in Germany has a magical technique to prevent it, and I guess your situation shows that definitely isn’t true. It’s possible to have a revision with colon or peritoneum, but it’s a big surgery. I don’t know how insurance coverage works over there so I can’t give you a lot of advice about that. Have you looked at Thailand at all? If you’re paying out-of-pocket, that is the most reasonable priced place for revision procedures.

That coud be me. But im just saying that people need to trust their surgeons more. Lets say you do hair removal but the dr. Told you not to. You coud damage the skin they use, or hair might even be missed do to hair follices comming in cycles. Or at least consult with the surgeon if you wanna do removal prior aniway.
</p>
<p>
A bit of luck will always be unvolved with this kind of surgery, thats just inevitable.

Yup, ive run into that person as well in reguards to medical scraping at the time of surgery. It puts a lot of &#34;luck&#34; into the process.
</p>
<p>
I second thailand as being reasonably priced option where a lot of good surgeons are.

Having had the combined method myself. The &#39;discharge&#39; your feeling is most likely sweat do to the combined method. It SHOUD get less and some day stop completly when the skin and urethral lining used adapts and doesnt produce sweat in that amount anymore.
</p>
<p>
The pain i cant really help with, since im not having any after the stage 2.
</p>
<p>
May i ask what dilators/size you use?
</p>
<p>
If you want to talk with someone who also had the same method feel free ro DM me, maybe exchanging experiences coud help sonewhat.
</p>
<p>
To the rest i honestly cant say to much.

Don´t know if you have seen it ... concerning after surgery
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126225535/https://marcibowers.com/transfem/gav/post-op-care/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/surgeries/transfeminine/index#wiki_after_surgery" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
may be more.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/support/index#wiki_connecting_to_others" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransAdoption/comments/nnz697/join_the_trans_galaxy_an_18_inclusive_safe_space/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be a number of hints concerning looking for support and connecting to others.
</p>
<p>
And concerning a revision later it may be preferable to do what is necessary now, and hope for the best. Maybe it would not be necessary.
</p>
<p>
There would be resources concerning a revision in the wiki for later in case.
</p>
<p>
And if you feel really low please reach out .. there are helplines, for example
</p>
<p>
thetrevorproject.org/get-help-now/ They also have a chat and further resources like Trevorspace so they could be accessed from anywhere. It may be possible to use a proxy like filterbypass .me  in case. And someone who worked there said they may also help people of all ages.
</p>
<p>
thrivelifeline.org/ They also have a chat
</p>
<p>
glbthotline.org/ They also have support groups.

Discharge means your vagina is cleaning itself it&#39;s going to be there for good. All cis women I know have a little.
</p>
<p>
As for the aesthetics and other stuff I sympathize there I also went to schaff and had issues there
