my partner had surgery with kamol 5 years ago and has yet to have ANY issues. her vulva looks natal, she’s comfortable, her only issue was that there wasn’t an english translator when she was there. but the surgery, healing, and result is fantastic.
</p>
<p>
i’m not saying kamol is good, im saying that not everyone who has been to him has horror stories and is needing a revision. in my opinion, i think kamol himself produces fantastic vulvaplasties, however, he
<em>
allegedly
</em>
seems to allow trainee doctors work on patients without notifying the patient, and some have bad experiences because of this.

I had a small prolapse in my vagina, which I had removed yesterday.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I also had my outer labia tightened.
</p>
<p>
The surgery took 2.5 hours and I am completely satisfied with the result.
</p>
<p>
The prolapse had obviously developed because I put too much strain on my body too soon after my first SRS (also with Kamol).
</p>
<p>
I will only find out more details at the next appointment with Dr. Kamol.

Most of the results of Camol are bad, it can be good as a review, but surgery from the beginning, I do not want you to regret it.

<p>
That&#39;s right!
</p>
<p>
And I know a few girls who have also been to Kamol and are just as happy.
</p>
<p>
But it seems to be in people&#39;s nature that they write much less on the internet when they are happy than when they are disappointed.
</p>
<p>
The only not so good result that I can remember was with a girl from the UK.
</p>
<p>
However, I have to be a little more specific about what I said about her - in and of itself, her result is good. It&#39;s just that the healing process is very slow. I suspect that this may also be partly due to the fact that she has a lot of liquid silicone in her bottom to make it nice and round.
</p>
<p>
You should know that this liquid silicone is the worst thing you can do to your body. It almost never heals and will always cause health problems.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the healing process will be different and, above all, slower than for girls who don&#39;t have liquid silicone in their bottom.

<p>
This confirms my suspicion that most of the girls at Kamol are quite happy with their results.
</p>
<p>
But they usually don&#39;t go online to report on their positive experiences, they just want to lead a normal life after the SRS.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, girls whose wish was not really fulfilled are very likely to write negatively about a doctor. If only for the sake of receiving encouraging words and sympathy.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s bad in principle and it&#39;s just human. Nevertheless, it distorts the image of a doctor considerably and I still think the Kamol clinic is a very good place to have an SRS done.
</p>
<p>
I would of course always be all the more interested to know what went wrong with Kamol&#39;s critics, because simply saying that Kamol is an alleged butcher is meaningless to me.
</p>
<p>
If someone were to say that they wanted a Barbie vagina and now their labia are too big, then that would be more understandable. In this case, however, the criticism of Kamol would be wrong, because he makes the vulvas and vaginas according to physical characteristics and even in cis women the vulvas look completely different.

Lol people don’t learn. Kamol won’t even do your surgery. He will draw lines. You will wait for hours in your room. Not really knowing when it is. And then you will get it by a random dude. And of course you will need revision because that’s what they do. They planned for you to come back and pay for them and your stay at k garden.  How much is k garden by the way? Close 50$ a night? Which is super expensive for thailand but n top of poor wifi.
</p>
<p>
Feel sorry for you but I made the Ames mistake and didn’t listen. So…

Kamol still operates himself - I noticed this myself, because you can&#39;t speak to him at certain times because he is in the operating room performing surgeries. Usually first thing in the morning and then again in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
It is therefore not true to say that Kamol only has the surgeries performed by young doctors.
</p>
<p>
This type of surgery is his life and he would never give up sole control to other doctors.

More proof that Kamol doesn&#39;t perform all the surgeries himself. Some patients have amazing results like you and others wake up with horrors that don&#39;t look like this at all and with a different technique. So booking Kamol is a bit of a gamble but is it worth the try idk

yeah you shouldn&#39;t trust them or be at the very least very skeptical, especially if their profiles usually sound like an ad for them
</p>
<p>
yes every surgeon has bad cases, but the amount and rate of such and how they&#39;re handled MATTERS immensely. 5 minutes searching for kamol results here should stop anyone from seeking surgery with them.

And I don&#39;t trust any post that puts Kamol down or denigrates him.
</p>
<p>
How come so many girls here in the house are happy and a few on Reddit are dragging the Kamol clinic through the mud and not even showing pictures of what is supposed to have gone so badly at Kamol.

She&#39;ll look incredible! Looking forward to see your progress. So 3rd pic is 1y post op(primary)? Can you tell us what method did you get , was it colon, ppt or pi? Also, if you could answer what exactly did you ask to touch up for tightening your labia minora?

I had a prolapse and previously a colon SRS.
</p>
<p>
I had this vaginal prolapse repaired and at the same time had my labia tightened, which was included in the treatment.
</p>
<p>
I will probably only find out the exact cause of my vaginal prolapse on Monday from Dr. Kamol.
</p>
<p>
It is quite possible that it came about because I put a lot of strain on my body at a very early age.

Why/how is the degree of wrinkliness so drastically different between the 1st and 3rd photo? I&#39;m so confused how that change is possible, it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s that much excess skin in the first photo.

<p>
With my limited medical knowledge (I only studied medicine for 2 years in Germany), I can only assume that the first SRS is always done a little more generously in order to have reserve material in case of later complications.
</p>
<p>
Necrosis, for example, is a risk in almost all surgeries where tissue is permanently lost.
</p>
<p>
And with material reserves, there are always options to replace tissue accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Another point is the healing process itself - immediately after the SRS, everything in this area is extremely swollen and hardly any doctor can say with 100% certainty how much swelling will subside.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there are empirical values ​​- but every patient heals differently.
</p>
<p>
Due to my daily exercise, the healing process was really extremely fast. But I also know girls whose vulva is extremely swollen even after a year. That&#39;s why I always tell them not to be sad or impatient, but to just listen to their body and wait. I always feel incredibly sorry when I read that things are not yet as good for other girls as they would like them to be and I can only try to encourage them and help them.

Sorry, I don’t think that answers my question - It looks like you had a similar labia minora size after primary surgery as I did in my primary surgery but I don’t see how it could look like your 3rd photo down the line. Maybe I need to be proven wrong. Were your inner labia touched up at all in revision somehow? Do you have any other photos of your post-revision results?

At the moment everything is still very swollen.
</p>
<p>
And yes - both the inner and outer labia were reworked.
</p>
<p>
I think that the swelling will have gone down a bit in the coming week and I will post more pictures then.
</p>
<p>
I am still really happy with the result of Kamol.

your results are very good.👌  I am also doing surgery in Kamol 8 days ago.  I am in the hotel now.  I noticed that our vulva is not similar.  you recovered very quickly.  I&#39;m very slow.

We can meet up - I&#39;ll be in the K-Garden (room 501) until Monday.
</p>
<p>
After that I&#39;ll move into an AirBnB (better for sightseeing and partying).

By the way, it was a really great and pleasant meeting with you. I moved into my AirBnB in the center of Bangkok today because I want to party here for another 2 weeks. Driving into the center every night outside of K-Garden is too inconvenient for me and I just love going out in the evenings.
</p>
<p>
Have a great time and relax well.
</p>
<p>
A big hug to you.
