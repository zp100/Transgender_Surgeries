15 minutes (not 50 minutes) once at full depth is what my surgeon uses. I do &#34;dilate extra&#34; up to 60-90 minutes at least once a day but if you still are expected to dilate three times a day try splitting up dilations into major dilations and minor (holdover) dilations.
</p>
<p>
do you do pelvic floor exercises? do you rotate the dilator around? do try to do kegels or stretch the tissue? do you do any self stimulation during dilation? can you orgasm?

Also yeah. Dr chettawut expects us to dilate 3 times a day 50 minutes per dilation, that&#39;s completely impossible for me due to how long it takes me to put the dilator in and two having to work a full time job..
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve actually been too afraid of tearing anything honestly. Only excessive I do is a lot of walking but that&#39;s because of my job. Would doing kegels actually work? I&#39;d think it would make it tighter. Also I do rotate the dilator but it being made out of glass, I fear I cause more blood doing so.
</p>
<p>
Also no I haven&#39;t done much self stimulation during dilation and no I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve orgasm but my boyfriend has teased me many times. I haven&#39;t really explored myself there out of fear of ruining something.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much for responding

!! You&#39;re not going to tear anything. to be honest it sounds like you&#39;re having trouble dilating because  you&#39;re refusing to use and stretch the canal as intended and now it&#39;s in danger of closing up. at 100 days the connective tissue holding the canal in place has already been well formed and most of the sutures have been absorbed into the body. please use your canal. stretch it as much as possible. slide it. do all the exercises. pleeeease do not squander your once in a lifetime opportunity.
</p>
<p>
any bleeding is superficial, from granulating tissue etc. you&#39;re well past the danger point of rupture from using the smallest dilator. at this point I think even intercourse is permitted by most surgeons.
</p>
<p>
kegels really help. tightening and relaxing = stretching = easier dilation over time. when you do kegels you make your pelvic floor muscles tired and stretched. this means that they don&#39;t resist the dilator as much and you are in less pain. do kegels for 5-30 seconds, then take a deep breath in THEN advance the dilator. rinse and repeat. then do circles. then do rotations. spread the lube around. stretch the skin. (remember it was already stretched at surgery and needs to maintain elasticity.) etc etc
</p>
<p>
you are SUPPOSED to rotate your dilator. you will only lose depth and never move up to higher sizes AS INTENDED if you don&#39;t follow the standard exercises that everyone uses. sliding. pelvic clock. circles. tapping. etc etc
</p>
<p>
and please try touching yourself it really makes dilation less painful even enjoyable. at 100 days dilation is sometimes annoying but I often lose count of my orgasms
</p>
<p>
IF YOU DO NOT USE YOUR VAGINA YOU WILL LOSE IT. you are not going to ruin it by touching yourself. you are supposed to! it encourages circulation (blood flow / perfusion) and therefore speeds up healing and breakup of scar tissue!
</p>
<p>
these are all factors that are definitely contributing to your difficulties dilating.
</p>
<p>
btw dilation protocol: 50 minutes 3X a day at 13 weeks? that&#39;s interesting. but dilating 15 minutes is better than 0 minutes. any time is better than no time.

Omg lol. I just tried doing a few exercises before dilating today and it just went in. No blood that I could tell either. I hope it&#39;s like that for every time I dilate now. Thanks fellow redditor!

<p>
and you definitely need to contact your surgeon. don&#39;t put it off. you probably have some hypergranulation that can be treated or ablated. do yourself a favor and BE PROACTIVE ABOUT RECOVERY
</p>
<p>
which country are you in now?

I am trying to see a gynecologist here. I am in the u.s. I&#39;m definitely trying to do as much overtime as I can to be able to go back to Thailand for a medical visit. Right now during Chris tickets are a whopping $3k and that is completely out of the question if I can come up with that kind of money for the flight alone.  The problem with gynecologist around my area is appointments are weeks in advanced or even months I have learned.

your surgeon doesn&#39;t take emails?
</p>
<p>
and try rotating your dilator - you might actually scrape or dislodge the hypergranulating tissue others have
</p>
<p>
when was your last gyn exam?

Yes! He does but for me honestly feels like I&#39;m talking to an alexa with generic answers. That or they misunderstand me through a language barrier. But yeah! That&#39;s what I think is going on? I sometimes feel stuff moving around when I dilate. Edit-my last appointment was about a month ago. I&#39;m attempting to make another appointment at the moment. Most likely late January sadly...
