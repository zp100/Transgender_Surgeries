Yay! Good for you. That&#39;s awesome.
</p>
<p>
How long was it between consult and surgery for you? I have a consult with them in August. Letters shouldn&#39;t be a problem. How did scheduling go? Also, sounds like you did FFS. You didn&#39;t also do that at NYU, did you?

Oh awesome--that&#39;s a fast turnaround. I&#39;m local but unfortunately I have a kind of inflexible schedule. We&#39;ll see how it goes. I&#39;ve started laser, but meh, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s working. I will probably need electrolysis.

Were you able to get any of this stuff paid for by insurance?

I had my initial consult in February of this year, an in-person consult in April and was scheduled for a date in September. I received &#34;expedited&#34; scheduling because (a) I had all of my letters and documentation; (b) I had already started hair removal and was mainly clear by the April consult; and (c), my insurance covers the procedure so it makes billing easy for them.

What did you do for hair removal? I have done 3 laser sessions and I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s working. I am thinking I&#39;ll probably do electrolysis. The person I spoke to in my office said RBL could give me a referral for insurance purposes. So I&#39;ve paid for full body laser and they&#39;re doing that, and I figure I&#39;ll start the electrolysis after I meet with her. But I dunno. Should I just start it now? Unfortunately there aren&#39;t that many times in the year when I can just take a month off.

I went to an electrolysis/laser practice that was referred to me.  We did two sessions of laser (ouch) and I&#39;ve done electrolysis sessions every 3 weeks since the end of last year (OUCH!).  For the purposes of SRS you only need to remove a triangular patch from the scrotum down to the anus (RBL supplies a template).  I&#39;m kind of lucky in that I&#39;ve always had very little body hair anyway, so it&#39;s mostly just been cleanup work.   Since my hair is blond/white than I have to do electrolysis for the most part - which is more expensive and painful.
</p>
<p>
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY DO AS MUCH HAIR REMOVAL AS POSSIBLE.  I&#39;ve had zero downtime after each session - in fact go directly to work after (thank you Tylenol).
</p>
<p>
Ironically, while I have little body hair I have very persistent, dark facial hair (thanks a lot dad).  I started removal on my face about 10 years ago and I&#39;m still removing it.

Yeah, I&#39;ve got the template. What a nice drawing that is. You are lucky to not have lots of hair. I don&#39;t need to be hairless, but I&#39;ve got so much annoying hair. There was no chance of HRT alone getting me to a place I was comfortable with anywhere on my body. And I have such dark, thick facial hair that even close shaving leaves me with a shadow. So, I&#39;ve been cursed.

Yeah I feel you. I&#39;m blond/light brown/white everywhere EXCEPT my face.  Dad had a thick black beard and gifted it to me.  That&#39;s why I started hair removal on my face 10 years ago, and still have electro done to deal with the strays to this day.  I must have had hundreds of hours at this point.  I figure it will be done a few weeks before I die.  Laser works on dark hair, but it&#39;s not really permanent for a lot of people.

Literally so nice. Very kind and caring. It’s a rough few days after surgery, but they make it better with their amazing care. They are the only thing I will miss about being in the hospital! I’m ready for a normal bed and no tubes hanging out of my body lol

So far, so good! I’m very swollen rn but when the took the bandaging and packing off, I could see it better without as much swelling, and it looked really good. All of my nurses were super impressed. She really is an artist. Good luck with your surgery!! Follow all of the post op instructions and you’ll be just fine

So far so good!! Just know that the day of surgery is literal hell. It’s been the hardest day of my life. But don’t let that scare you. It’s worth it. So so so worth it. Congratulations on your date and I hope all goes well for you! The team here is the sweetest and even when they’re busy as hell, they take the time to be awesome and make you feel safe and taken care of.

YMMV, personally for FFS, I just went home and slept for HOURS, and the meds handled basically all of the pain, but not this time. It’s been Very hard for me. But I’m managing!! And thank you!! I will definitely post updates and stuff (although probably not pics or anything, I don’t think I feel quite comfortable with that, but I’ll describe it! Lmfao)

I had an overnight in the hospital, and they tortured me with poor climate control and lack of icing, and nothing for my clogged nose (due to the rhinoplasty) or sore throat (due to the tracheal tube from anesthesia).  By the next day I had literally not slept a wink and was hugely suffering.  It took a literal week before I could sleep through the night, and the pain went right through the oxy.  The only thing that mitigates it is that the surgeon did an awesome job, and I&#39;ve healed much faster than expected.

Oof that sucks! I wasn’t hospitalized when I had ffs and that could be why my experience was less intense. But for this surgery, I’m in the hospital for 4 more days, and I’m dreading the removal of the packing and stuff. But yeah yesterday (day 0 as they call it) was torture. Today is a WORLD better. And the team is so sweet and are so helpful. Also my tv is HUGE lol which doesn’t matter at all but it’s something I’ve been laughing about. It’s comically large

Good to know about the TV!  I won&#39;t bother with my glasses then ;)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard that the pain progression is a lot easier with SRS than FFS.  I&#39;m having BA next month, and I was told to expect 3 days of discomfort. I figure I&#39;m going hardest to easiest

It was the most mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting/painful day of my life. By far. Hot flashes, panic attacks, crying, etc. it got tremendously easier after day 0 (day of surgery) but it was hell. This experience has been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. But it is worth it. Just hope for the best, but expect the worst. Keep your expectations low, and be happy when it gets better

Hmmm, that, I’m sorry to hear. By chance did you attend their pre-surgery web session?

Grats! I&#39;m quite happy with Dr. Bluebond and Dr. Zhao&#39;s work. :) I wish I had inner labia though. It&#39;s my only real gripe about my vagina....but every woman is different so I can accept that.
