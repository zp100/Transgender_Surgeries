Im looking to get SRS in Spain as I’m based in Europe and don’t want to travel to Thailand for surgery
</p>
<p>
So far I’ve had a consultation with Ivan Manero’s clinic and I am quite confident to go with them But was also researching into Dr Jesus Lago.
</p>
<p>
Can anyone give me any insights on both? And which would you prefer? Or any other in Europe also
</p>
<p>
Looking to get the colovaginoplasty btw :)
</p>
<p>
Thanks

I am in the same situation as yours.  I also went to a consultation with Ivan Mañero.  In my case I was not very happy for several reasons.  The first is that he told me that he had operated on over 2,000 transsexuals and that all of them were happy with their results and that is a lie because I know several who are not and secondly he showed me only one photograph that I had already seen on his website and In none of them can you see the internal part of the vulva, which is something I give a lot of importance to.  Jesus Lagos uploads photos of operations every week on Twitter where he shows his results well but I personally don&#39;t like how it looks on the inside.
