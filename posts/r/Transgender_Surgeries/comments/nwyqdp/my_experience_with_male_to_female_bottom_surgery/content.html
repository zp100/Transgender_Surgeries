It’s no wonder why so many trans folk turn to self medication when our experiences with doctors are so frequently awful. From long wait times, to poorly understood hormone therapies, and even arbitrary insurance requirements for gender affirmation surgeries. While these are just a few common points of frustration, almost every trans person I’ve met has deeply personal stories of their disappointment in trans healthcare, myself included.
</p>
<p>
If you’re interested in male to female bottom surgery, please read on and I’ll do my best to tell you what it was like for me.
</p>
<p>
A bit about myself — I’m a transgender woman who’s been on HRT since 2019. I’m in fairly good shape and exercise often in my daily routine. The biggest health issues I face are narcolepsy (which is feeling tired no matter how much sleep you get), and cataplexy (which is a weakness in your muscles as if your body thinks it’s supposed to be asleep).
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly sensitive to pain and most over the counter meds have no little to no effect. And while stronger drugs do work, they don’t last as long as they would for an average person. Thankfully I don’t seem to have a genetic predisposition to addiction. I’ve never craved pain killers, weed, alcohol, or even my daily ADHD meds. Ice cream seems to be my major weakness though. I like to tell people that I eat like a yak farmer — mostly yogurt, cheeses, and bread.
</p>
<p>
Mentally, I’m usually upbeat and can talk myself thorough frustrating situations. But I can get overwhelmed when a situation is out of my direct control, and seemingly unending struggles through medical bureaucracies are sort of like the perfect storm for my personality faults. My strategy for dealing with frustrating situations is channeling that energy into actions.
</p>
<p>
Something will most likely go wrong after your surgery, but it probably won’t be that big of a deal, at least by itself. Under-dosed pain management, being asked to leave the hospital before you’re ready, and passing out on the toilet after your first bowel movement. These are just a few of the moments when I felt helpless and maybe even a little betrayed. After all, I followed all the steps to get to this life changing surgery, so why was I being punished?
</p>
<p>
It was only after many little things that went wrong that I felt like every bit of pain was a personal attack on my dignity. Look, I get it. I chose the surgery, waiving off the warnings of how difficult it would be. But it’s not like there was much choice in the matter. The post-op experience could’ve been twice as bad and I still think I would’ve done it all over again. That’s how badly I wanted a vagina. For better or worse, it’s life changing surgery. Personally, I thought it could’ve gone better. Dr. Avanessian does great work and aesthetically I’m really happy. In my opinion, Mount Sinai’s transgender care runs like a factory. It’s a mess and I think my recovery was unnecessarily difficult.
</p>
<p>
It’s been about four months since surgery, but I wrote my thoughts out below as they came to me, raw emotion and all. I was so angry, and I’m still a little angry, but the words felt right at the time, so here they are.
</p>
<p>
After just waking up from six hours of surgery, the nursing staff repeatedly shouted at me to adjust myself into different positions for a change of beds or something that could’ve been done before I was partially conscious. And to make matters worse, my hands were completely numb! Apparently this is somewhat common as a result of a pinched nerve stuck in a fixed position during a long surgery. Maybe they should wiggle your arms every few hours but I’m not a doctor so whatever.
</p>
<p>
Okay I gotta talk about the narcolepsy thing for awhile because it was such a clusterfuck of incompetence that I’m surprised I didn’t end up with concussion. There are small things about narcolepsy like automatic behavior, where my hands might move and it looks like I’m alert, but I’m actually not alert. I’m
<em>
actually
</em>
asleep. And repeating your request to start or stop moving won’t work.
</p>
<p>
I spent most of my recovery doing what unmedicated narcoleptics do: sleep. And much of my other free time was spent with my eyes half lidded in a cataplectic state that looks like sleep. On several occasions I had doctors and nurses come into my room to ask a question or pass along some information, only for them to assume I was unconscious and walk out without a second thought. I know this sounds counterintuitive, it’s just that I specifically told every single person about this before surgery.
</p>
<p>
A few days into my stay a nurse helped me walk to the restroom, my first steps for since I laid down for surgery. The hospital had trusted this tiny woman to catch me if I fell. And with her only guidance of asking if I was dizzy every few seconds, loosely holding my still numb hands, I was suppose to just fall where exactly? And to up the stakes, cataplexy makes this even more dangerous! A combination of pain, temperature change, and strong emotion is a perfect situation for me to ungracefully tumble to the ground in seconds. They should’ve asked if I needed a walker or a brought a second nurse.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to ask, “how are you feeling?” and it depends on if you actually care or not. Nurses ask this question with the tone and cadence of someone who does care, but with the indifference of someone who doesn’t. It seems that every question is actually already answered. There’s nothing we can do about the room being too hot, so the answer to the question, “are you comfortable?” should be yes. Questions like, “would you like some help brushing your teeth or washing your body” were never asked because they were too busy to deal with me.
</p>
<p>
I’m pretty sure the only real decision I was able to influence was vetoing the staff’s attempt to put someone in my room — something I was told repeatedly was not going to happen. Something caused the hospital to overbook their rooms. I really don’t give a fuck if there was a 10 car pileup. I just had major surgery and it’s pandemic. “We’ll try but we can’t guarantee anything,” is all they could say. I had to get my doctor, nurse, and social worker involved to put this idea to rest. I walked over a mile in a blizzard dehydrated and nauseous on an empty stomach. I held up my end of the deal. They can find another room.
</p>
<p>
It seemed to work but I never actually got a confirmation, and had to spend the evening contemplating if I would be checking out early that night and dealing with my recovery at home. I was losing trust in everyone’s ability to listen to my needs. I once spent the night in a garage during a sub-zero winter, and it still honestly felt like I had more comfort and autonomy than my stay at Sinai.
</p>
<p>
My social worker’s heart was in the right place, but I wasn’t sure what she was actual capable of. She asked if I had any concerns and I commented on my back pain. If it was possible to have a physical therapist take a look at my back, maybe it could fix my numb hands too. The look of confusion on her face was unforgettable, as if I was asking for a luxury spa massage; asking as if the hospital had any gold bars lying around I could take home with me. Absolutely ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
A nurse rushed in after I called for pain meds, asking how bad it was from 1-10. I replied “6 and rising,” as I fanned my fiery crotch. She replied, “can we write 7?” This is really bizarre and unnecessary. What difference does it make? Put down 10 if it makes you happy! And there seems to be a deliberate air of mystery to what meds are available. “We’re going to give you something that should help manage the pain.” What drug? What quantity? How long does it take?
</p>
<p>
On one occasion a nurse informed me that I had “missed a window” for a full 10 milligram dose of codeine but she could dispense 5 milligrams without needing approval from the head nurse. I just had my dick origami’d! I don’t care if the pills come out of a bubble gum machine or a crane game. Do what you have to do and please just bring my medicine so I can leave this place.
</p>
<p>
I find it so interesting that hospitals focus their opioid metrics entirely on medication
<em>
not
</em>
dispensed, and yet they still don’t offer alternatives like physical therapists, and acupuncturists. A massage on my nerve damage hands could reduce the need for pain meds, or at least distract me from the pain, but I guess the $120,000+ billed to my insurance just wasn’t enough to cover those kinds of luxuries.
</p>
<p>
Despite the daily fuck ups, I was still uneasy about going home. I stayed for just four days and three nights, a decision I still can’t think of as anything but unjustifiably cruel. Patients have to return for a post-op a just a few days later, so why are they being sent home with vaginal packing, catheter, and a wound vacuum? Why put them through needless pain and suffering when they could spend that time healing in hospital bed with round-the-clock care?
</p>
<p>
It’s not like New York is all that handicapped friendly, and the snow from the morning of my discharge wasn’t doing the city any favors either. The troubles started before I even left my room when the nurse steering my wheelchair immediately bumped into the bed, painfully jostling my surgical site. We made our way through the halls of doe-eyed people seemingly unaware that they should
<strong>
move out of the fucking way as quickly as possible.
</strong>
Instead I had to literally crane my arm out to nudge people away from my delicate chair. Why wasn’t the nurse marshaling them out of the way? Maybe this is why they send people home so early…
</p>
<p>
Finally, we make it outside to trucks and buses honking and whizzing by at earth rumbling speeds. I called an Uber XL since the cost of an ambulette was somewhere around several hundred dollars. The driver arrives but all the parking spaces are full of idling ambulances and 15 foot high mounds of snow. You know something is seriously wrong with a hospital when its curbside pickup is worse than an Applebee’s.
</p>
<p>
As a single nurse kept me upright on icy sidewalks I hobbled into the street thinking this would be the worst time to have a cataplexy attack. Getting hit by a car in front of a hospital would be just the kind of ironic death a millennial could ask for.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I climbed into the Escalade, double checking not to get blood and piss all over this guy’s car. I never felt more relieved than once I was under my Uber driver’s care. He drove slowly, carefully, and even blocked traffic as we walked into our apartment. I think I tipped him 100% and still wasn’t enough for how amazing this guy was.
</p>
<p>
My caregiver and I somehow made it back with mixed feelings of relief that we were home, and fear that we couldn’t handle the next few days. This should’ve been a celebration but every single one of these issues had really soured what was supposed to be life changing surgery.
</p>
<p>
As I expected, the next few days were Hell. I kept on top of my pain med schedule, but they didn’t seem to work. My vaginal packing began to feel as if it was covered in crushed glass. I think this was the moment when I ran out of patience and truly began to hate everyone who hurt me in the slightest bit.
</p>
<p>
Post-op pain management was a hazing ritual. There’s an “emergency number” which connects to the transgender surgical office but they’re only open on Wednesdays during business hours. All other weekdays are dedicated to surgeries. But if you’re having a
<em>
real emergency
</em>
, the phone staff will try to reach your doctor. And if you’re having an emergency such that your life is in immediate danger, you’re directed to the Emergency Room.
</p>
<p>
So I got a call back from a doctor in the department and got him up to speed. “It feels like I have glass in my vagina and I’m running out of meds.” Same answer: Avanessian is in surgery and I should wait until my follow up appointment two days later. I tell him that either someone who’s trained can help me remove the packing today, or I can take all my meds and do it myself tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
He objects, asks “what will you do if there’s uncontrolled bleeding?”
</p>
<p>
“Well then,“ I reply smugly, “I guess I’ll go to the hospital and they’ll help me finish.”
</p>
<p>
His official recommendation is to not touch anything. So I tell him what I think, how dealing with the recovery and narcolepsy has been a nightmare. Naturally, he says “Okay. I’m sorry you feel that way.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>
THAT’S NOT A REAL APOLOGY.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Oh, you’re in so much pain, huh? Prove it. Come to the ER and spend the day with us for a $600 Vicodin. That’s the game and it’s completely fucked up. If their policy is to have patients go to the ER, why send them home in the first place? I think it’s a money thing. The vagina factory can’t be held up with a bunch of people lounging about the ward taking their sweet time healing up.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I got a call from Dr. Avanessian asking if I was truly going to remove my packing myself. I told her if the pain was still going on, I would watch a few YouTube videos and figure it out in the bathtub. She relented and made some time for me that evening. Packing out. Pain dialed down. Brain working.
</p>
<p>
The recovery has been generally better after that, with a few especially memorable painful moments sprinkled between. I’ve had a particularly stubborn hyper granuloma (a kind of skin tag that bleeds easily), and some granulated tissue. Both were treated with silver nitrate and clobetasol.
</p>
<p>
My biggest issue as of lately is dilation. For awhile I was on the third size, but my vagina seemed to really tighten up. I’m seeing a pelvic specialist, but I have a hunch that my tightness is physiological and mental – basically residual trauma from a really shitty experience. She’s a pretty vagina though. Dr. Avanessian‘s style tends to emphasize plump labia majora which I think looks more natal than other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I don’t believe that my doctors preferred that my experience went so badly. Dr. Avanessian listened to my frustrations and offered an apology, something along the lines of “I’m really sorry you experienced that. It’s already happened and I can’t change that, but we can do better in the future.” I believe she’s sincerely trying to do her best. It’s just that this is more of a systemic failure, which is the worst kind because there’s so little accountability. Everyone’s just “doing their job” and patient outcomes are tabulated into some abstract score. You’re kinda fucked if you don’t fit into the surgeon’s expectations.
</p>
<p>
If you get the surgery and it doesn’t go as planned, just know that someone out there understands what you’re going through. Plan for the worst. Be your best advocate. Moisturize your elbows.

Wow. Thank you for sharing, and I cannot believe you ever had to go through this.
</p>
<p>
I truly hope I never need to receive medical care in the U.S.

Thank yo for sharing your experiences. I am so sorry you had such a negative experience during such a life changing event. I don’t imagine recovery is all rainbows and sunshine, and I get that ppl are human, but it really sounds like the medical team could have done so much better. You’ve definitely given me a lot to think about and a lot of questions to take to my consultation next year. I’m not sure I want to go to Sinai if this is the experience I can expect. I’m wishing you a smooth recovery girl and I hope your days get brighter! ❤️

Yeah dude I literally waited 2 whole hours for my consult, the front desk woman first said she lost my paperwork, acted frantic. I spent over 1k on that trip and I in that moment thought I wasn&#39;t going to bevaeen and started balling in the waiting room. BUT bella herself seems amazing so I am moving forward with her.

Holy moly, I knew Mt. Sinai had issues, but good lord.  I’m so sorry you had such a rough experience.  Thank you for sharing your story, and I hope this helps future patients looking for their surgeon make an informed decision.

I had my surgery with Dr Avanessian as well in July 2020. Dr A really knows her work but Mt Sinai really could work on their interpersonal skills. From the time I started to work on getting my surgery at Mt Sinai to the day of my consultation with her probably took about a year getting paperwork and insurance and most of all just getting through to someone to find out what&#39;s going on, etc. Once I finally got a name and number of someone to call it was a bit easier. Then for me, it was 8 months from consultation to surgery. Mt Sinai is different than most hospitals in that you are in there for 3 days after surgery, they then send you home or to your recovery location and you come back on the 7th day post surgery to have your packing removed and they show you how to dilate. The absolute worst part was the 45 minute ride to my mom&#39;s and the 45 minute ride back to the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the dilating, when I was on green (size3) I had some bleeding, maybe from moving up too soon, so I just backed down to blue for another week then tried green again. My method every time was to start with 1 then 2 then 3 then hold the largest dilator that I could get in. Orange (size4) I still struggle with but I have full depth to dot5 which is 5.5&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, except for a little granulation, I didn&#39;t have any complications and really wasn&#39;t in much pain, super uncomfortable for sure though.
</p>
<p>
Dr A did my BA as well in January 2022. I didn&#39;t have to stay overnight for that.
