What are the chances you could be persuaded to provide me with a copy of your instruction packet?  You can send by either email or snailmail at your discretion.  I will send you payment of whatever you ask in advance and thereafter you can send the copy.  Please?

Sorry, I certainly do not mean to intrude into your life.  I was thinking of a copy of the blank forms.  But if you&#39;ve already filled them in, there won&#39;t be any blank forms for copying.  As for payment was only thinking to support your own efforts as you would be supporting my own.  I just want to get the feel and learn all I can as I try to make progress on my own journey.  Thank you fornreplying. Moana

While the couple examples of aesthetics of his work I’ve seen were fantastic, I consider Dr. Witten to be a “function over form” surgeon. (He agreed with this assessment.) His background in reconstructive urology makes me more confident that the sexual and urethral functions will be correct from the start. I personally feel less worry about getting a revision for aesthetic reasons than for these things, which means this is a desirable trait for me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
i agree with this, glad to see somebody else on here voice this view. this place tends to emphasize aesthetics above all else but the reality is it&#39;s 1000x easier and less invasive to get an aesthetic revision / labiaplasty than it is to fix fundamental issues with function and anatomy. the biggest factor in my choice of surgeon was the feeling that a large amount of time and care would go into the surgery itself and the knowledge that i would have reliable, accessible follow-up care in the event that anything went wrong.

If you are looking for a skilled electrolysist (specifically  for GCS) in Louisville KY look up Christina at Louisville Electrolysis. I love her to death.

No problem. It has been impossible to find someone knowledgeable in my local area. Louisville wasn&#39;t the easiest and using the nurse practitioner at Dr Witten&#39;s office was all but impossible.

This is really helpful. I have a consultation with Dr. Witten in a few months. I did originally have one set for earlier this year but I was a bit late and had to reschedule

There is a trans electrologist in Louisville. She does bottom surgery prep. She’s really good and knowledgeable as well. Authentically You Electrolysis
