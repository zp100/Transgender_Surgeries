I love the clear post-op bandages. That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen that used.

Oh...Bloody Hell, DID I NEED ONE OF THOSE!!!
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a brilliant idea. Especially for the first 7-10 days post-op. It there a portable version of a wound vac?
</p>
<p>
How long has he been using that on his patients?

Yes, it’s portable and I’ll go home with it. The vac and foley stay until postop day 7-8. On my first postop visit they remove the vac, foley and vaginal packing. The vac will hopefully keep the swelling down and let the incisions heal, although I’m not sure how strong any literature is to support its use. I’m relying more on eating a high protein diet, which good nutrition has been shown to prevent many postop complications.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know when he started using them, but I’m pretty sure I’ve seen pictures that he has used them since 2017-2018? But don’t quote me on that…

I can review. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
</p>
<p>
I had my initial consult in April, 2019. I think my waiting time for a consult was 4 months at that point, but I also already had been on HRT for over a year, and had letters from my medical provider and therapist, so I just needed to see the Sinai psychiatrist for my second letter.
</p>
<p>
On my preop visit, I saw the PA, Jim, and Dr. Ting. We talked and he did his exam. It was quick. I know I’ve read a lot of people say Dr. Ting didn’t take a lot of time with patients and he was in and out of the exam room, was sort of short with them, etc. I won’t say this is not true. He has never been rude, he seems nice and polite but he’s much more of a no nonsense kind of guy. I’m a surgeon as well, so I sort of get the attitude. Not a lot of fluff. And I have had a surgeon who was much more interactive and personable who would take a lot of time to discuss things with me etc. almost sort of coddling, but without any insulting undertone. Anyway, Ting was in and out, I asked whatever questions I needed and that was it. He answered to my satisfaction, which again may be different from a lay person.
</p>
<p>
So, I chose my date for Jan, 2020. But had to reschedule due to some family issues. My rescheduled date was august, 2021, which was moved to July because they had an opening. Then, it was just a bunch of waiting. I had already started laser way before my preop date. By the time I was ready for my first surgery date I had 11 rounds of laser and a few hours of electrolysis… in retrospect it was good that my date ended up getting moved because I still had a surprising amount of hair. So, I started doing electrolysis, and maybe accumulated about 20-30 hours?
</p>
<p>
I will say that hair removal should be started as early as possible. And in my experience laser didn’t remove all my hairs, just reduced them. And the laser did turn them into a fine blond color… or maybe those were the hairs that laser didn’t touch? I did have dark hairs that remained around the shaft of my penis and electrolysis took care of those.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, about a month before surgery sinai started to contact me more to make sure insurance was set up, I had all my supplies for home, visiting nurse, etc. they were on top of everything for the most part. I did have one hitch in regards to insurance. My insurance company called me two months before the surgery and told me my vaginoplasty was approved and everything was set. I didn’t think much of it and didn’t ask any specific questions. But a week before surgery I found out my insurance company only approved the procedure as an outpatient surgery, and did nothing approve me for a 3 day inpatient stay! Not only did they jot tell me this, they didn’t tell sinai this either! So, stay on your insurance company to make sure the procedure is fully approved and the inpatient hospital stay is approved also. Call them and specifically ask the ICD10 or cpt codes that are being covered. It was a easy change once I found out, but the panic and anxiety that this was happening 6 days before my vaginoplasty was awful.
</p>
<p>
I did the bowel prep the day before surgery. My asshole was so sore from painting the toilet.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Sinai at 530am. Got checked in. Was in the anesthesia holding area. The resident, fellow, and Ting came by for a quick hi. Asked if I had any questions. I didnt. They left. Around 8 I was taken into the OR. Laid on the table. The CNA gave me some Iv versed initially, then a few min later induced me and the next thing I remember is waking up in recovery.
</p>
<p>
After 30 min they took me to my room on the 7th floor. I currently have a vac and foley In Place. The nurses have been attentive. Ting has seen me along with the fellow/resident every morning to briefly check the surgical site. The PA also drops by to see if I have any questions, etc.
</p>
<p>
Pain is minimal. I just feel a lot of pressure in the pelvis. I’m only getting toradol, Tylenol and gabapentin for pain with an occasional oxy for break through. The nurses are getting me out of bed twice daily. I’m having a lot of gas. Haven’t had a bowel movement yet and the abdominal distention from the gas is probably the most annoying, but not painful.
</p>
<p>
I guess that is all for now…

Heck that was a lot, wow! Thank you so much for being so detailed in your response,  especially considering you&#39;re still in hospital.  I can&#39;t thank you enough.  Funny,  my experience has been the Same with Dr. Ting..lol. Glad to hear you are doing well with recovery, super happy for you.  Good info regarding the insurance,  appreciate they can be shifty sometimes. Had similar issues with BA. Not looking forward to the bowel prep, but I guess a small price to pay. One last question...promise....how many days in advance did you do the covid test at Mt. Sinai? My surgery is Wed and I&#39;m arriving on the Sunday prior. Thanks again for everything,  thoughts are with you ❤ and wish you well on your journey,  Sammy

Please ask as many questions as you want. I’m not doing anything and sorta stuck on bed rest since there is the walking restriction. So, I got my covid test 5 days before. I think that is basically a requirement for all hospitals. Covid swab was on Wednesday and then surgery on Monday. They are really fast with the results though, so if you get the covid test at Sinai, then they will have the results in 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and good luck with your surgery, which I guess is next week!!!
