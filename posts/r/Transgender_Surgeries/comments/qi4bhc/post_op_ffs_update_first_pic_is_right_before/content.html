Iâ€™ve felt good enough to go out a couple of times recently. Just this past weekend, I went to dinner and a show with my partner and it was so incredible to just blend in. Finally, Iâ€™m not being clocked left and right. I was hoping for some relief in this area and itâ€™s really paid off.
</p>
<p>
I also notice when Iâ€™m out with my children, they are more at ease now. They used to look around waiting for someone to clock me and it made us all kinda nervous. Now, we can just relax and visit, eat and enjoy ourselves without issue.

Dylana, you look amazing. While the changes appear subtle, the overall changes are simply brilliant! I&#39;ve been giving FFS a LOT of consideration.  I&#39;m 56 and have a fairly masculine face. I would love to have changes akin to yours. Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind me asking?  One question I&#39;ve asked others post FFS is what have the changes been like for you when you look in the mirror? A friend shared with me that now she no longer wrestles with seeing the man she once was. She only after recognized just how much mental gymnastics that she was doing each and every day to push back that dysphoria. I&#39;m already aware of my own dysphoria.

Looks great! I&#39;m 3 weeks post op FFS (and BA), and really anxious for the swelling to go down!
</p>
<p>
Best wishes for a continued good recovery

Also did you get your adams apple shaved down? It wasn&#39;t in the list of work done. Just curious!

That&#39;s very cool!
</p>
<p>
I have another question. Your skin looks so shiny. How do you get your skin to have that shiny glow about it?
</p>
<p>
Ever since I started hormones 6 years ago my skin has become very dry. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to keep it moist and shiny but having no luck.

You look great.  But...I think you looked great in your before too.  Do you really notice a huge difference or is it that you feel different and then feel more confident in being you?
