Some people use puppy pads under themselves when they are dilating. I just bought a bunch of cheap towels that I could wash.
</p>
<p>
A used standard menstrual pads until I was healed.

Pads you stick inside your underwear so that you can wear your undies without getting them soaked.

Look up Medline Extrasorbs AP pads.
</p>
<p>
Those are the ones Dr. Ting&#39;s hospital staff gave me. When I got home I ordered more of them online.
</p>
<p>
They come in all different sizes and bundles. Just shop around for the cheapest priced ones. I think I got a 24 pack of the 18x24 size and they lasted the entire post-op recovery. I still have like 5 left over.
</p>
<p>
As for pads - just walk to the nearest drugstore and purchase them in person.
</p>
<p>
AVOID ANY SCENTED/FRAGRANCED PADS/DOUCHES/FEMININE WASHES.
</p>
<p>
Order bulk medical grade saline off of Amazon for douching.

Menstrual pads for in your underwear to take care of bleeding/discharge/leaks
</p>
<p>
Puppy pads under you while you dilate because lots of lube makes a mess.

I found always pads are the best as they don&#39;t stick to the wounds at all, I personally got the super thick ones, if I did it again (which thank goodness I dont have to go through that again)  I would have gotten a much thinner pad. Like the always radiant flex foam.
</p>
<p>
I also reccomend the always sports pads once you are mostly healed but still have a little discharge, thin, comfy and absorb just enough.

As far as puppy pads, early on they are super nice, when you don&#39;t feel like standing much or doing laundry. But now I just use a small hand towel when I do it.
</p>
<p>
Also Huggies natural wipes are super nice as well for clean up afterwords, I just use washcloths now, but for the first couple weeks sitting up to do laundry kinda sucks.
</p>
<p>
I could give you a whole list of useful post op crap you could buy, could also give you a list of shit that I bought and never used lmao!

In and post hosptial:
</p>
<p>
Video games, movies, books, etc, any activity you can laying down. I played a lot of guitar personally. Make sure you are stocked though the first 1.5 months are hell. Being up for more than an hour is a chore
</p>
<p>
An electric heating pad or some rice bags, because soothing
</p>
<p>
In hospital:
</p>
<p>
A hospital buddy or 4 to visit you while you are there especially if you have complications and are stuck there a while like I was, 2 weeks of isolation sucks.
</p>
<p>
Thank you cards, and cute gifts for your nurses and doctors. Trust me! Treat them good and the more time they will spend on you, and slip you treats. I got a 4 course meal one night because I had a good relationship with my nurse and one of the doctors was having a birthday party downstairs. (I really can&#39;t stress this enough, make your nurses feel special af, it will come back 10x)
</p>
<p>
A portable fan, being off hormones gives you hot flashes, being on opioid gives you hot flashes. Being in pain gives you hot flashes. Besides blowing a fan directly on your wonderfully painful new vagina is kinds the best feeling.
</p>
<p>
Dry shampoo for when you are in the hospital, as well as some wipes for cleaning up smelly parts of you. The nurses will take care of you, but sometimes your pits stink.
</p>
<p>
Really loose non elastic pants, like 3-5 sizes too big, sweat pants, scrubs, etc
</p>
<p>
Loose panties a size too big, you really don&#39;t want anything pressing on your pubes mons after surgery for the first while
</p>
<p>
A decent size water cup with a straw, get you a yeti, the little plastic cups they offer are tiny and suck
</p>
<p>
A ride to and from surgery. And a backup, shit happens
</p>
<p>
Post hosptial:
</p>
<p>
Dakin solution (medical bleach water mixture, you can make it yourself with bleach and distilled water but better to get the medical grade stuff, I had to make my own later on) this is used for disinfecting the wounds early on being that it is in such a cross contamination prone area (check with your surgeon)
</p>
<p>
Sterile Gause pads for cleaning, early on, good for Dakin  absorption
</p>
<p>
bacitracin ointment, I went through 6 fucking tubes
</p>
<p>
Wash cloths, a fuck ton of them, I had 15 and wished I had more, lint free if you can find them. Dilating 3x a day sucks and wash cloths help clean up the mess you leave behind because for the first while you are going to use a ton of lube.
</p>
<p>
Always pads, you ooze, and discharge so much crap the first 3 months, this will prevent you from ruining underware. And staining pants (they will supply these in the hospital, need these for after)
</p>
<p>
Medical / puppy pads, awesome for the first while when doing laundry sucks
</p>
<p>
Unsented, natural wipes, same as above, avoid ones with detergents and sents, they burn like hell.
</p>
<p>
Surgical lube, I reccimend surgilube tried a few others this was the best, at least 24 tubes of it (36+ if you don&#39;t want to have to reorder during your healing). You will go through so much the first year dialiating
</p>
<p>
Tylenol extra strength, because ouch
</p>
<p>
Stool softeners, don&#39;t want to worry about bearing down for the first while, we don&#39;t want prolapse
</p>
<p>
A lube injector, sex shops carry them, its a lube syringe, gets the lube up there early on while you are learning to dilate
</p>
<p>
White vinegar, for douching
</p>
<p>
A good douching kit, one of those red hot water bottle styles.
</p>
<p>
Betadine for douching early on, also useful later on if you get a funky smell down there and your flora is off
</p>
<p>
Good antibacterial soap or &#34;toy cleanser&#34; and a lot of it. You will likely be using multiple dilators per session early on and all that shit needs to be cleaned before and after, the wash cloths come in handy then too.
</p>
<p>
If you can, invest in a bidet system for your toilet, wiping sucks early on
</p>
<p>
A nice medical ice pack, preferably felt wrapped, because soothing (not for directly on the site, can interfere with nerve growth, but for above where the leftover testicular tissue is, because omg that sucks)
</p>
<p>
One of those armed pillows for sitting up in bed, because you are going to spend a lot of time there
</p>
<p>
Extra pillows for your bed, you can&#39;t sleep on your side or stomach for the first while, could cut off circulation to the surgery site leading to necrosis, tuck them to either side of you to keep from rolling over
</p>
<p>
Pre make a ton of meals and invest in a crock pot, freeze what you can, and speak to friends about making you the occasion meal and bringing it over
</p>
<p>
A donut to sit on, the rubber ones work but there are some that are oval shaped with cutouts on the front and back that make things much more comfortable sitting after
</p>
<p>
Ask your doctor for some ambian or some other sleep aid, useful for the first month when you wake up in pain.
</p>
<p>
Friends/family/neighbors, whoever you can recruit to do stupid things like take your garbage out, get you groceries, cook for you, spend time with you... its lonely healing by yourself
</p>
<p>
A good $100+ toy for when you are healed enough to use your equipment again, because that first orgasm after months is fucking amazing.
