Take two advil and let us know how you&#39;re looking in a couple of days.  üôÇ
</p>
<p>
Do you use a desensitization cream like Lidocaine or Zensa?  When I go, I apply that and let it sit on my face for about an hour prior to numb the skin but the neck and under the chin/along the jaw is very sensitive and painful... There&#39;s no real way around it but to put your big girl panties on, drop a bunch of f-bombs and get through it.

I didn‚Äôt use cream but she did say we could try it next time. She also said the same thing about the neck being the worst part. I showed her my progress and she said she would change the duration spent in each follicle. I should have also mentioned that she uses the thermolysis method in case that makes a difference. She said I was at a ‚Äú7‚Äù intensity. I‚Äôm be sure to update, thank you!

Neck is very irritating, so is the chin and upper lip. Makes my leg jerk every time it gets one.
</p>
<p>
The redness is normal and it should go down in a few days. Try witch hazel. That typically cools and soothes after a session.
</p>
<p>
But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been bruised before.

&#34;7&#34; means nothing. That&#39;s a setting on her brand of machine. Different brands use different settings. For example, my machine I use a percentage for the current and milliseconds for the length of the pulse. For example 0.037s /76%.    or.   0.023s / 72% ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Bruising is not something I want to see after electrolysis. I admittedly have done some substandard work as an electrologist, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever given anyone a bruise.

Maybe inaccurate insertions? Bruising is always listed as a side-effect of electrolysis, even though I only see it when people come to me from someone else. Possibly over-zealous stretching of the skin by your tech. I really don&#39;t know.

Your electrologist is ripping you off.
</p>
<p>
You have fair skin and dark hair.  You are a prime candidate for (proper) laser.  You&#39;ll be done far quicker and far cheaper with laser, plus with less skin damage.
</p>
<p>
Electrolysis is used to tidy up at the end for people with your skin/beard combo.
</p>
<p>
Your electrologist knows this, but they&#39;re instead choosing to work on you at a significant hourly rate.
</p>
<p>
My skin/beard combo was exactly like yours.  My electrologist cleared me in about 100 painful and expensive hours.  So about ¬£5,000.
</p>
<p>
Laser would&#39;ve removed the vast majority for well under a grand, leaving maybe 10 hours of tidying up.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still a little annoyed that her goal was lining her pockets instead of advising me properly on the best route to clearing my face quickly.

Thank you! It was explained to me that laser would work for me but could take longer and could keep coming back. Then I‚Äôd need electrolysis anyway. It‚Äôs hard to tell but I also have quite a bit of grey hair as well. So the combination of that and me wanting to get this over with as soon as possible has taken me down the electrolysis route.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm now thinking I should get a consultation someplace else and see what that have to say about it. Thank you!

The only reason it ‚Äúkeeps‚Äù coming back is due to hair growth cycles. Once you catch every valid the in every cycle it won‚Äôt grow back.
</p>
<p>
My gf has done exclusively laser and she‚Äôs had no real issues other than a few hairs that the laser can‚Äôt zap.

This. Your hair grows in cycles. That&#39;s why it takes time for the laser to get each growth cycle and why they schedule you at so many weeks apart. Only thing the laser won&#39;t get is light or gray hairs, but electrolysis will get those.

From personal experience with laser with a similar facial hair color to yours: it works SPLENDIDLY. I&#39;ve only been doing it for about a year (sessions every 6 weeks) and I literally can&#39;t even grow a beard anymore. It&#39;s just thick peach fuzz now with some darker hairs still around my mouth and chin. One or two more sessions and we will start on electrolysis but I doubt I&#39;ll need many sessions of that.

A consultation could be worth it, though youre right about electrolysis being more effective. Electrolysis is the only true permanent hair removal. And if you have any lighter, redish, or grey hairs it wont get them.

Laser is permanent. Once a follicle is dead, that&#39;s it. There&#39;s no coming back with either Laser or Electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
The issue is catching the hair in the cycle where you can actually target the follicle, which is more difficult with laser. Your hair is on lengthy cycles so you can really only target a certain percentage of it on each go even with a powerful laser session.
</p>
<p>
Electrolysis is falsely seen as more effective because they dig into the follicle with a needle and zap it regardless of where it is in the cycle. But that takes a huge amount of time and effort, whereas they can just scan your skin with the laser and delete anywhere from 10-25% of the follicles in one go. Takes minutes compared to the lengthy electrolysis sessions.
</p>
<p>
It just feels like your hair &#34;grows back&#34; after laser because a) the follicles need to fall out on their own and b) laser only targets a handful of the follicles on any given patch of skin compared to electrolysis which removes all of the visible follicles in an area.

Laser is not permanent hair removal.
</p>
<p>
Laser is effective for reducing excess hair. Laser targets the hair by using mild radiation that is attracted to dark-coloured hair (melanin) with the help of high-heat lasers. This is why your skin needs to be light and your hair needs to be dark. Laser can remove existing visible hair, but only permanently destroys 1 in 6 hairs at each treatment. These poor results from Laser are because the bulge and its stem cells are relatively transparent and therefore immune to heating by laser light. With laser hair removal, the laser beam connects with pigments (melanin), meaning dark skin can be burned by absorbing too much light. Additionally, it only works on dark hair - not white, grey, red or blonde.  It&#39;s not a permanent solution. For this reason, the FDA, the AMA (American Medical Association) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) only permits Laser to describe themselves as ‚Äúpermanent hair reduction‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through its Center for Devices &amp; Radiological Health regulates electrolysis equipment, lasers &amp; other medical equipment. Amid the growing popularity of laser hair removal &amp; the extravagant claims of manufacturers &amp; clinics, the FDA reiterated its position that only electrolysis can permanently remove hair &amp; warned laser clinics against making such claims.
</p>
<p>
The FDA Consumer Health Information Bulletin of 27 June 2007 states &#34;The US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes electrology as providing permanent hair removal, The FDA identification in Title 21, CFR, Sec 878.5350 for needle-type epilators is: &#34;a device intended to remove the hair by destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; As no other device for hair removal has the unique identification of &#34;destroying the dermal papilla of a hair&#34; only electrologists are allowed to claim permanent hair removal in their advertising

True, after laser when your hairs will grow back (and they will with this technic) if they are lighter or less dark you will have to do electrolysis, it&#39;s the only way to get rid permanently of your hairs.

It‚Äôs hard to tell in my photos but my beard is mostly red, orange, blonde and grey. There is quite a bit of brown and black hair as well. Everyone I spoke to said I would be doing laser for 1-3 years and then electrolysis for another 6 months to a couple of years. Or I could do electrolysis for 12-18 months and another year maybe of maintenance. Far more expensive but done in less time and so I just went with the route that maybe takes less time. But also nothing I read or was told was precise or concrete lol. Everyone‚Äôs experience is different so I guess I won‚Äôt really know what to expect until I‚Äôm on the other side of this.

Definitely seek another clinic. I was puzzled as to why you were getting electrolysis when you obviously need laser first.
</p>
<p>
Laser works gradually, but over the course of the past year I only have my mustache growing a few stray hairs, and then the white ones will get electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
My tip would be to seek local trans communities, they might give you a better adress.

I tried reaching out but all advice I was given (which was very little) sent me in the direction of electrolysis. It‚Äôs the amount of bruising that has perplexed everyone and myself.

Well that is perplexing as well. I&#39;ve done a little electrolysis so far and I only had a couple scabs, nothing as dramatic as what you received. My guess is a bad practitioner unfortunately

Hey, wanted to add that the type of laser matters too. I went to one place for my first few sessions, and they thought that their laser was supposed to be painless, so they set it on the lowest setting so I barely felt it and I never really got much in terms of results after 5 sessions. I think that laser was meant for thin female hair.
</p>
<p>
I eventually went to another place with a much stronger laser, which I think is needed for thick dark hair like I have. It hurt 1000x more and my face looks gross / hairs are darker for a few days, but the results were literally instant; I had hair that had fallen out of my face during the laser session all over my face and noticed a nice reduction. It has taken about 9 months but I&#39;m finally at a point where I could probably stop and just do a quick trim every other morning.

If you are under the age of 30 than it could possibly be new normal growth. Laser won&#39;t kill everything, but it&#39;s much cheaper and faster than electrologist for an initial clearing. You won&#39;t have to do as much electrolysis, and it will be cheaper overall to do both.
</p>
<p>
Also I am not sure but it feels like it in my case at least; the laser will get your growth cycles more in &#34;sync&#34; so you can get more hairs in the growth cycle for electrolysis then you would otherwise. So that you see results faster in what remains after laser.

I hasn‚Äôt even considered the growth cycle being in sync. That‚Äôs a great point.

I‚Äôm definitely going to get laser for the initial clearing.

Essentially that it would likely be cheaper, faster, and more effective to start with laser and once that has cleared a significant amount, take care of the stragglers with electrolysis.

If you could go back and do it again, would you skip the laser on your face?

She was incredibly sweet and was very informative. She kept describing everything about the process the entire time and keeping a conversation going really helped with how excruciating the process became as it went on. She kept turning the intensity down when I‚Äôd comment on the pain and it seemed like she was being really mindful. So at a point, I stopped complaining because I figured this was just the normal level of pain to expect and so I just..took it. The euphoria I was feeling knowing that this hair would finally be gone was more than enough to keep the pain bearable. When I left though, the entire area that had been worked on was incredibly swollen and dark purply red. Now it‚Äôs sort of rough and scared feeling across the entire area that was worked on and I have a lot of bruising. The pain is almost entirely gone now and I don‚Äôt have any other symptoms other than a tiny bit of itching.

Yes thats pretty normal to look like a bad rash or hives after electrolysis, especially on the neck. Had mine done there 12 years ago. Electro felt to me like someone smacking me hard with a rubberband each time.

Yeah and my partner bought me some as well to use at home. I iced it first day and I‚Äôm keeping it clean and also haven‚Äôt been wearing makeup. The bruising makes it look worse than it is at this point but the skin is healing nicely. I just couldn‚Äôt find anything at all saying that bruising was normal aside from something maybe the size of a dime and so I got worried that maybe she was going it wrong.

Im not trans, but I have PCOS, so I got electrolysis because my hormones kept making me grow a small beard, so I wasn‚Äôt a good candidate for laser. the first few times when she did big clearings, my face was swollen for a few days after and it looked a looked a little red and rashy like yours, but my results so far are great and faster than I anticipated. So you could probably find an electrolygist that doesn‚Äôt cause as many reactions, but you will still have some skin reactions regardless &amp; sometimes if they don‚Äôt treat as aggressively it takes longer to treat. This week is the first time I went in and hadn‚Äôt taken Advil so it hurt a lot more. Just remember to take something liked 2 Advil at least 30 minutes before you go in or buy some numbing cream, so you don‚Äôt have to sit there feeling like ur suffering the whole time since it‚Äôs a slow process .

It looks normal although laser would probably be cheaper and far less painful to get started. Once you have got rid of the dark hair then finish up with the electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
My face is pretty swollen after electrolysis but passes in a day or so. The bruising might be due to the skin being thnner there I guess.

Looks normal. I&#39;d highly suggest doing laser first, then follow up  with electrolysis.

Yes, very normal and will fade in a couple of days. I usually put some lotion on the next morning and that pretty much clears it up.  Buckle up though - Electrolysis is a very long and arduous process , typically  200 to 400 hours for full completion.

I‚Äôve been going for approx 300 hours and nearly finished with both my chest and face. It was practically all white hair so I wasn‚Äôt a good candidate for laser.
</p>
<p>
I HIGHLY recommend this
<a href="https://www.cfspharmacy.pharmacy/blt-compounded" rel="nofollow">BLT numbing cream
</a>
. The 120ml lasted me approx 170 hours of treatment. Using it on my upper and lower lip causes them to go completely numb for a few hours, like going to the dentist.

I‚Äôm prepared to buckle up but I really wanted to make sure it was being done correctly. I will endure quite a bit, to the point where I won‚Äôt be aware that I‚Äôm being mistreated until it‚Äôs too late and the damage has been done. The cost of this however is definitely something I am not prepared for and have no idea how I‚Äôm going to afford to finish. That‚Äôs an entirely different issue lol. Maybe I should take the general consensus and not skip the laser. Even if the entire process takes longer, it seams like it will be more affordable and less torture.

The cost completely sucks! Outside of surgery It&#39;s actually tends to be the most expensive part of transition. Even with the decent rate I get ($50 per hour) it will run 10-15k and two to three years.

No choice for me because of hair color. As others have said, if possible, laser for the bulk and electrolysis for the final clean up.

My skin was quite red and very enflamed every time. Though my electrolygist thinned my hair out before doing a full clearing of any area. If your person isnt thinning you out first and is going for 100% clearing on the first go that my be causing excessive irritation, inflamation, and damage

I did the laser and electrolysis combo. I have never experienced bruising from electrolysis but the pink irritated area and hive like appearance - yes. I have had this area dependent even with icing and strong skincare. I strongly agree a laser consult could help you. I had a few techs who did my face at various times. I think that the pain level is highly variable to where is being zapped and how frequently. Icing areas between zaps and not just machine gunning- but letting pain subside after a few zaps to cover an area made a world of difference for me. And the tech who had dark hair and who had done a lot of laser herself, over her pure blond colleague who had less empathy in my impression.

I would recommend to get 3-6 sessions. I think lots of people are overdoing laser because electrolysis is painful and expensive. When electrolysis can clear your face it is preferable from the perspective of outcome. The thinner darkish hairs sometimes don&#39;t receive enough energy from laser to be fully treated but recover after a while.
</p>
<p>
Since you grow a full beard laser will be more economical though for at least a few sessions to catch the majority of dark hair. As you can see in one electrolysis session you only covered a small part whereas with laser you could&#39;ve already treated the full area. So in the current stage doing a laser session will get faster progress. That changes when the amount of dark hair is significantly reduced after a few sessions so switching after that will give the fastest way to remove all hair. Staying with laser too long leaves all the lighter hairs untreated and hinders progress.
</p>
<p>
I have only done electrolysis because I only grew a beard around lips and chin. I still would have had a faster progress with a few sessions laser for the bulk of dark hair, but I could reach a full clearance of face with electrolysis relatively fast. Also had lots of swelling, especially in the beginning when the density of hairs was still significant. I am still doing sessions now as there are still a few stubborn hair popping up every now and then after almost 3 years. It takes only a few minutes though and is getting more and more negligible.

Do laser first. Dark hair with light skin is the best. I went from a full thick beard to only having a small goatee. Now there‚Äôll be so much less for electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
LHR is basically permanent. You may need some touch up every once in a while, but it‚Äôs not like it fails at some point. It gets your hair such a lighter color and coverage.

Looks like my skin after an area that hasn&#39;t been treated before or hasn&#39;t been treated for months because we are working in other areas of the face for a while.  It should go down in a few days, and it should be less bad if you keep treating that area over time.
</p>
<p>
That said, I&#39;d think about laser first given your dark hair and fair skin.  I did 11 months of laser to get rid of most of my black hair, and the electrolysis part for the 1/3 that was grey or stubborn is still taking forever.

A couple things one when I had electrolysis I swelled up pretty bad. It can be fairly terrible at first. Second you kind of have the ideal hair and skin type for laser. You might consider doing that for a while and then switching to electrolysis. I think it would save you time money and pain. But that&#39;s just been my personal experience being a ghostly pale person with dark hair.

If it feels like your hair is being plucked after you hear the &#34;Zap&#34;, you&#39;re getting &#34;plucked&#34;, physically and financially. This can cause bruising from the trauma. Make sure that after you hear and feel the zap that the hair comes out effortlessly and is not being plucked out. If you can&#39;t tell, ask her for a mirror so you can watch. You can tell a plucked hair because you can see your flesh being pulled with the hair. If you can see that, she&#39;s wasting your time and your money.

It definitely felt like every single hair was plucked after that initial zap. So much so that I could feel the tweezers slip off often and she‚Äôd had to try to pull it out again. She also showed me the hairs and said ‚Äúsee this is what you want to see, that little black dot on the end or a little white tail.‚Äù She got one that had a ‚Äúsleeve‚Äù on it and showed me and said ‚Äúthis is good too, this one won‚Äôt come back‚Äù.

But when I watch videos on YouTube, it definitely looks like the hairs all have this massive thing on the end of the hair and they all slide out very easily.

The hair will literally slip out when treated correcly. I&#39;ve had both good and bad electrologists, the ones who were pluckers had me back again and again. The good ones, I saw steady progress. You can focus on one area of your face to see if she&#39;s making progress.  Take a selfie and watch for changes. I&#39;s easier than assessing your whole face.

Neck will hurt like hell, was told to hydrate plenty, moisturize often, use a moisturizing mask on the area the night before, Advil  an hour before an cream at least thirty minutes before the session. It sort of helps, since the dryer the skin is, the more power is required, while more hydrated the skin is, less power is needed. Laser doesn&#39;t fully remove hair, it simply thins it out, so it&#39;s less painful and faster to treat. Body hair is also faster as it naturally thins out while the facial hair simply slows down somewhat but remains dense.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;ll stay red like that for a while, specially when focusing on the region, also makes it more sensitive. Upper lip is supposedly as painful if not more so warning. But it&#39;s best to focus on an area for a bit then move to another to give time to the general area to recover so it&#39;s not as sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Laser was suggested to me but decided to just tough it out for now, do plan on eventually doing a pass or two to thin out the hairs. Maybe by years end but with Covid hitting harder (lockdowns started) it&#39;s been hard finding places that have open spots due to all the backlog. So toughing it out for now

See this is more on point with what I was told before making my decision and all fingers were pointing toward electrolysis. Now that I‚Äôve done it though it seems like everything is pointing me towards laser. Feeling a bit defeated at the moment but I‚Äôll let this heal and then get back to work. I‚Äôll try your methods, thank you! Either way, I‚Äôm definitely going to get a consultation someplace else just to have a better understanding of my options. Thank you!

Never done laser been doing electro for almost a year but on average two hours a month. It&#39;s slow and painful, but once the hairs gone its gone. Laser just makes it so the hair is thinner so the treatment is less painful.
</p>
<p>
Electro is more thorough, with a good practitioner and ensuring skin is as hydrated as possible etc it&#39;ll come. Its just slower because its more methodical and hair to hair. Once they&#39;re gone they are gone unlike laser, that still requires you do electro. If its too painful etc then take some time to do a handful of passes then do electro. Its frustrating but it is part of the process. I have a beard thats denser and covers more area specially on the neck. Hurts like hell, but once its done its done, and the occasional regrow take less power and hurt less. Its much slower because its methodical obliteration of the dreaded facial hair....
</p>
<p>
One year in July and I have half the neck fully gone (mine nearly covered the entire front of it 1 hoyr per two weeks... yours will take time, but its not as dense. But laser does help if its available.

Thank you! I‚Äôm definitely more than willing to just endure it and be patient but only if I can rest easy knowing that it‚Äôs being done correctly and that I‚Äôm in good hands. I‚Äôll do another session and see how it goes and if I still feel the hairs being plucked out then I‚Äôm going to switch to laser for the first clearing someplace else and then have someone different do the electrolysis.

Inflammation for a day or two is normal in my experience.
</p>
<p>
As others have said, I&#39;d encourage you look into doing laser before electrolysis so you&#39;re getting more bang for your buck.

I would add a nice recovering cream to your skin after each session!
</p>
<p>
This stuff is what my electrologist recommended and it&#39;s really nice. Cicalfate.

<p>
Also (and you probably know this) make sure to wear a thick layer of sunscreen and minimize sun exposure for the few days right after!

That looks normal. Heck it looks better than my first session, but she did it on my chin. Give it a few and it should clear, if it doesn&#39;t follow up with your electrologist.

if it feels like hair is painfully pulled means they aren&#39;t using enough power. Or not double pulsing. Mine double pulses and i don&#39;t feel the hair being forced. I feel it but feels more like its loosened out not forced. Should not feel it tugging.

She kept the power between 7-9. That‚Äôs how she put it anyway. When I showed her the bruising, she said she‚Äôd actually spend less time on each hair so now I can only imagine the tugging/plucking will get worse.

I have sallow skin with dark hair. Less than 10 sessions of laser had the vast majority removed and then finished off with electrolysis. Even after 2 to 3 sessions the difference was massive! It was probably only about 6 sessions where most was gone. Just so long ago I can&#39;t remember!

Absolutely the better option. Given your skin is so light it should be even more effective on you. About a week or so after laser a good exfoliation should help remove any loose hairs in the follicles.

I generally take Advil, Tylenol and a Benadryl before the electrolysis. That looks fairly standard. Oh also use a numbing cream
</p>
<p>
As others have said, laser is going to be faster and going to clear out the vast majority. I had undertones of red so laser stopped working after about 6 months on my face. At that point I moved to electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not seeing any bruising but that could also just be me being tired this morning if you do have bruising, I never experienced that.

It‚Äôs hard to tell in these photos but I actually have a mostly orange/red beard with lots of grey and blonde. Although there is also a lot of dark brown/black hair. It sounds like even if it‚Äôs only for a little while, I should start with laser and then move back to electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs also hard to see in these photos but the entire area that was worked on ended up bruising. It looks even worse today but that‚Äôs just because bruises look worse as they heal.

Thank you! She was the very first person I spoke to about it and we continue to communicate and I send her photo updates. She won‚Äôt say wether or not it‚Äôs good or normal but she did say that she‚Äôd ‚Äúlower the duration‚Äù and ‚Äúturn down the intensity‚Äù. She said she was doing it at 7-9 intensity. I don‚Äôt know that the scale is though.
