Hi lovelies!  I think this is going to be a long post, so I&#39;m going to try to put in some relevant headings
</p>
<p>
Tl;dr: Dr. Pang is amazing in every possible way and I&#39;m so thrilled that I had him take care of me.
</p>
<h1>
My background
</h1>
<p>
A quick bit on me: I&#39;m at 32 year old female who transitioned a little over two years ago.  I&#39;m also an emergency medicine resident physician, which means that I&#39;m a doctor that is specializing in emergency medicine (i.e the doctor you see in the emergency department), but although I&#39;ve graduated medical school and am licensed, I&#39;m not yet &#34;board-certified&#34;, so I work with my supervising or &#34;attending&#34; physicians until I finish residency.

</p>
<h1>
Timeline
</h1>
<p>
For me:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
2019 July - called to start the process, with goal of surgery in summer 2020
</li>
<li>
2019 December- had my appointment with CTMS
</li>
<li>
2020 March - Initial appointment with Dr. Pang, canceled due to Covid
</li>
<li>
2020 June - Re-scheduled date with Dr. Pang
</li>
<li>
2021 January - Surgery!
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
Getting Started
</h1>
<p>
For Mt. Sinai, they have a very, very comprehensive system in place and overall I was impressed by how well everything was put together given how disjointed most of transgender medicine is.  Basically you start by calling CTMS and they get the process rolling.  A few things to know ahead of time that make life easier:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Check with your insurance that they cover this. Do it in a polite way, and ask questions that get you to specialists. My insurance company (Health New England) actually has one person that handles all claims regarding transgender medicine, so she knows ALL the specifics about requirements, what&#39;s covered, where to go, etc.
</li>
<li>
Get a therapist that you see regularly. First because every human should, and second because it&#39;ll make the process easier.  Please make sure they actually know what they&#39;re doing in terms of treating gender dysphoria and know how to write a good letter.  My first therapist wrote a letter that CTMS was not particularly pleased with because it was basically one line.
</li>
<li>
Make sure you&#39;re on hormones for one year and two years out publicly before the date you want surgery.  These requirements may change, they may not.  But they are what they are for now.
<ul>
<li>
Thank you to
<a href="/u/cesarioinbrooklyn">u/cesarioinbrooklyn
</a>
for pointing out my earlier mistake and also mentioning that WPATH currently recommends 1 year of each prior to surgery.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
First appointment
</h1>
<p>
Your first appointment will be with CTMS, not with Dr. Pang&#39;s office directly.  CTMS basically does all the background work so by the time you see the surgeon, you&#39;re basically golden from a financial/legal/insurance perspective to go ahead with the surgery.  It&#39;s one of the things I kinda like about the way they do things if you ask me.  Your appointment with them will include a social worker, psychologist, case manager/coordinator, and medical clearance.  They will make sure all the paperwork is in order for you.  Since I came from out of town, they arranged it so all my appointments occurred on a single day, which was nice but long.  This was pre-Covid, so my partner was with me in all these appointments.
</p>
<p>
After that, it took a few weeks before we got the paperwork sorted out and got my appointment scheduled with Dr. Pang.  Inconveniently, this was scheduled for March.  As you can imagine, this was canceled as Covid struck in force in Manhattan (not to mention my work drastically changing as well).  Fortunately this was re-scheduled for June, which we were able to keep.  At that appointment, Dr. Pang spend a lot of time talking with me before performing a fairly brief exam and took pictures for pre-operative planning.  After that, I went out and scheduled a date for surgery!
</p>
<h1>
Surgery Preparation
</h1>
<p>
So some things to know about before and after surgery.  First, you need an appointment within 30 days of the date of surgery by your primary care doctor or an appointment will be scheduled with the Mt Sinai team (this is typically an insurance requirement that you are medically healthy still for surgery).  They also require bloodwork - including testing for pretty much all drugs and especially for nicotine, which is a pretty uncommon test.  This surgery relies on the body being at its most optimal in order to heal properly, and even then we don&#39;t always get perfect healing (namely things like the incision at the &#34;posterior fourchette&#34;, the area at the edge of the vagina towards the anus, commonly separating).  Nicotine drastically impairs this process, as does other medical issues such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.  Getting all these things under as best control as possible will allow for the absolute best healing.
</p>
<p>
They also require that you stay in the area for 30 days after surgery.  They do not provide housing.  I&#39;m fortunate and was able to rent an AirBnB for the 30 days we were there.  You&#39;re in the hospital for the first 4 days, and you have a follow up appointment about a week after surgery, a week after that, and then two weeks after that, just before leaving for your home if you&#39;re out of the area.
</p>
<h1>
Arriving for surgery
</h1>
<p>
A &#34;bowel cleanout&#34; is required 24 hours prior to surgery. This helps to decrease the changes of infection as the surgeon needs to access your rectum during the surgery and also decreases risks should there be something happening that causes a tear in your rectum during surgery.  It&#39;s a thoroughly unpleasant process, mostly because the drink made me want to vomit.  It took me about 8 hours to drink half the amount I was supposed to, when you&#39;re supposed to finish all of it in about 4 hours.  In the end though, the goal is that only liquid is coming out your butt and when you wipe there&#39;s no brown - so if you get there, you should be fine.
</p>
<p>
The surgery takes place at the NY Eye and Ear Infirmary, which I find hilarious.  In any case, I was checked in and brought to a private room up on the 7th floor where I would stay for the next four days.  Shortly after I was brought down to the OR pre-op area and waited for a few hours until I was brought back for surgery.
</p>
<h1>
After surgery
</h1>
<p>
I woke up in the post operative area somewhat groggy but in minimal pain.  I don&#39;t remember too much of the first night as my surgery didn&#39;t end until a little after 9pm.  After surgery, you have vaginal packing along with a foley catheter in your urethra for urine and a wound vac over your vagina, covering the whole area.  Even with all that, the emotional and psychological release for me was enormous.
</p>
<p>
The days consisted mostly of pain meds and such, eating three meals brought to the bedside, and just trying to relax.
</p>
<h1>
Post operative course
</h1>
<p>
After you go home from the hospital, you are set up with a visiting nurse that will evaluate you and determine how often and what services you will need.  For me, given my background, there was little needed and the nurse evaluated me the first day and we discussed and agreed that there would be little benefit to their visits.
</p>
<p>
My journey was fairly unremarkable.  I&#39;m at 5 weeks now and things are going very well.  I will say that I think I had quite a bit more pain than most patients.  Dr. Pang told me I would be unlikely to need the opiates, but that was very much not the case.  It was very hard for me to go the full four hours between doses at times, and even after I got home the pain continued to worsen.  They do provide a prescription for opiates at home which helped but did not last long enough given the amount of pain I was in.  I don&#39;t think this is a result of Dr. Pang&#39;s work but rather simply my body and it&#39;s reaction to the surgery, so please don&#39;t let it scare you!  At this point, 5 weeks out, the pain is fairly minimal except when dilating.
</p>
<h1>
First appointment and dilating
</h1>
<p>
I had my first appointment at 8 days after surgery.  I saw the PA Jim who removed the bandages and took out the vaginal packing, which was extremely tender and sensitive for me.  He then showed me how to dilate, which was exceptionally painful and unfortunately got worse for me.
</p>
<p>
I was able to dilate as instructed three times a day, but I could only use the blue #2 dilator.  I mentioned my concerns to Dr. Pang on my next visit with him and he was surprised by my level of pain.  However, it seems I have exceptionally large (and now swollen) pelvic floor muscles that were causing most of my trouble.  He provided some muscle relaxants and breathing exercises that actually did help quite a bit.  I&#39;m still quite tender while dilating, but I&#39;m able to rather easily get up to the largest orange #4 dilator at this point for a full 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
During my third week at home, after the second appointment, I had two episodes of significant bleeding.  This lasted about 5-10 minutes and was substantial by my standards as an emergency physician.  It was also drastically unpleasant, uncomfortable, and painful.  However, given the nature of the persistent drizzle of blood coming from my vagina, I determined that there was nothing really to do about it should I go to the ER.  Eventually it stopped, and I did talk to Dr. Pang who reassured my conclusions.  (The only intervention possible would really be to go back to the O, and you
<strong>
<em>
really really
</em>
</strong>
don&#39;t want to do that if you can&#39;t avoid it. Since the bleeding stopped on its own, nothing to do!)
</p>
<h1>
Conclusions
</h1>
<p>
Overall I am overjoyed at the results of my surgery.  Things are still quite swollen and I&#39;m hoping my labia majora will contract some as the swelling goes down, but I need to give it a few more months before we draw firm conclusions.  My mons pubis, the area over your pubic bone in the middle, is also still quite swollen and I&#39;m waiting on that to go down as well.  The aesthetic and overall appearance of my vagina is perfectly average - I couldn&#39;t be more satistfied.  I&#39;m happily planning on returning to Dr. Pang for FFS with a consult already scheduled for March.  I hope anyone in the NYC area finds this useful and also has great experiences with Dr. Pang!

I have a few questions.
</p>
<p>
Why did you choose Dr Pang?
</p>
<p>
Given that this surgery is a very medical thing, I find it quite interesting that there&#39;s nothing really in your story that sounds any different to anyone else who posts here. If you not have said you&#39;re a physician I&#39;d not have guessed. Do you think it influenced your experience at all?
</p>
<p>
Probably a bit of a cliche, but do you think it will influence how you treat your patients in the future? The inadequate pain control for example.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few other trans doctors around, although they usually keep it quiet. Anything you&#39;d like to add for their benefit?
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I believe using the dilator to apply pressure is the usual way to stop that.

<p>
I had essentially chosen Mt Sinai because of the existence of the transgender surgery fellowship.  When you have a teaching program, in my opinion you&#39;re forced as an attending or fellow to be really on top of things because the new learners are constantly asking you questions and making you think of new ways to do things (or stupid ways to do things... but you still need to come up with a good answer!).  After that, it was a matter of choosing someone whose profile I liked, and I liked that he liked working with residents!

</p>

<p>
I tried to write the post for a non-medical audience.  However, I wanted to provide my background that I do have an &#34;inside seat&#34; in medicine as things like having my surgery scheduled for 1pm and not start until 415pm was thoroughly unsurprising to me.
</p>
<p>
Also, surgery is
<em>
very
</em>
different from emergency medicine.  Especially this field of surgery which is focused on the slow healing process, something I really know pretty minimal amount about in practicing emergency medicine.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As an emergency physician, I have a front-row seat to the benefits and risks of opiates.  In my opinion, and I think backed by most modern literature, using opiates for traumatic (including surgical) pain is not only appropriate but it is the most effective method of treating that sort of pain.  I personally prefer early, aggressive pain management for patients.  However, I will certainly concede that the longer a patient is out from surgery, the less I can comment on the utility of opiates for pain management.  At some point a line must be drawn between acute and chronic pain, and opiates absolutely are not the answer for chronic pain.
</p>

<p>
I wish I knew more about them earlier in my life!  Growing up how I did, and then going to medical school realizing I was transgender was incredibly scary - I didn&#39;t know anyone who had done that before so it was hard to imagine myself in the doctors I worked with.  I think having transgender role models is really important in every field!

I don&#39;t trust surgeons (or anyone really) so I do tons of research instead. I got a bit carried away.
</p>
<p>
I looked though your post history and it reminds me something I&#39;ve noticed with other trans doctors - they don&#39;t seem very interested in trans medicine, HRT, etc. I find it a bit odd, since it concerns me greatly and very personally, but there we are.

Always a good idea to do as much research as you can when it comes to something as unique and specialized as transgender medicine.
</p>
<p>
In terms of dealing with transgender patients, frankly I would love to.  There&#39;s just not much of a role for emergency physicians in transgender medicine, which is mostly surgery and outpatient medicine.  It has made me seriously consider going back for a plastics residency...

I know a young transfemme attending who did an EM/IM residency. She now does outpatient gender care :) She was the only transwoman I knew IRL before I transitioned.

Apart from anything, you&#39;d have a really good marketing edge if you went into trans surgery. I think there only 4 trans surgeons in the USA at the moment (Marci Bowers, Christine McGinn, Ellie Zara Ley, Gregory Dowbak).

You can have both, but unlikely to have them done at the same time.  Both are major surgeries and I don&#39;t think any surgeon would do both at the same time.

Thanks this was an interesting perspective. Just to clarify did you have penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr Pang ( I&#39;m unsure what kind of vaginoplasty options he performs )

Cool. I&#39;m curious if he gave any details as to his technique, was it differentiated from others or similar to any others or gave any references? Both for the vaginoplasty as well as the vulvoplasty ? I&#39;ve seen one result of his for ffs that looked very good and I know he went through their fellowship but don&#39;t know too much about him.
</p>
<p>
I like that mt sinai has a trans Surgery fellowship but it seems curious to me that it seems to run the gamut from ffs through grs when you consider that people often come to specialize in each of these surgeries and often come to them in specializations related to the area (like craniofacial / maxillofacial or even ent focusing on ffs vs urologists and gynecologists often going to specialize in grs )

I can&#39;t really speak to his technique other than to say I&#39;m satisfied with the results and felt confident in how he described the procedure that his decisions seemed logical and reasonable.

I like that mt sinai has a trans Surgery fellowship but it seems curious to me that it seems to run the gamut from ffs through grs when you consider that people often come to specialize in each of these surgeries and often come to them in specializations related to the area (like craniofacial / maxillofacial or even ent focusing on ffs vs urologists and gynecologists often going to specialize in grs )
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Great comment!  So this is a result of the fellowship itself!  These are specialized procedures which are the culmination of additional training often outside of a physicians initial training (residency).  By having the fellowship, they are able to provide their fellows all of this training rather than focusing on just one specific transgender surgery such as FFS for max-face surgeons or like SRS for obgyn.  As a result, I&#39;m more confident in them providing these services as a result of their more comprehensive education.  (However, that&#39;s not to say no one else can do as well or better - just if you take things at face value, that&#39;s why I went with them!)

Yeah that makes to me. I&#39;d be curious to know more about the specifics of it. I&#39;ve only ever found it&#39;s posting on various md fellowship sites.

Given that it&#39;s not accredited, there&#39;s not required curriculum.  I suspect this is the type of fellowship that is tailored to each fellow and they have some general points to learn over the year or two but also focus on areas they specifically want to learn and practice.

Yeah that makes sense. I think accreditation for trans surgery either general or specific is a major next step in maturing the field.

I mean even with an accreditation that will still happen but having one would at least point to a standard people can use that isn&#39;t &#34;let me give you the history of this surgery and explain how these people&#39;s backgrounds makes me suspect their competence&#34;

That would be a reasonable next step, but I&#39;m not sure if it will get there given how few surgeons there are.

considering the rate of increase at which trans surgeries is desired... I mean demand heavily outstrips supply right now - especially if we get stronger rulings from the dept of HHS on GRS being covered and SOC8 makes FFS &#34;medically necessary&#34; per the recommendation by the working group I think you&#39;ll see demand explode.

How did you feel about the length of the hospital stay? I do really like Dr. Bella Avanessian and I love the tunica vaginalis technique, but being sent home with packing, a wound vac, and a catheter is incredibly off-putting to me, and they&#39;re just tubes and possible complications I don&#39;t want to have to deal with when I&#39;m in recovery. If anything, a 2 1/2 day hospital stay feels irresponsible to me as the first week is where a lot of complications can occur, and it really makes me feel like Mt. Sinai is rushing their patients in and out the door.
</p>
<p>
edit: I just saw that it was 4 days for you, which is great that its longer, but personally that still feels short.

I thought four days was a bit much, but that&#39;s what they recommend so that&#39;s what we did.
</p>
<p>
Although there may be complications, you have to remember that every decision we make in medicine deals in risks versus benefits.  The risk of you having a significantly detrimental complication is outweighed by the benefit of not being in the hospital, which itself is a risk.  As soon as its clear there are no immediate problems with the wound vac and as long as the foley is working, there&#39;s really no reason you can&#39;t be sent home, particularly because they do have visiting nursing set up.

They definitely will keep you in the hospital longer than 2/3 days if need be. I suffered a complication early on (surgeon was Avanessian) I was in the NY Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary for around 5/6 days.

I&#39;m sorry to hear your surgery went over - hopefully nothing bad!

I was unsurprised by being late to my surgery because operating room scheduling is infamous for guarantees on its lateness after the first case.

oh whoa what a coincidence! apparently the cautery machine malfunctioned and burned me twice... luckily not on any vital tissues, it was on my thigh and my mons, and Dr Pang resected the two little burns and it’s healing mostly just fine. the only problem now is that i have some extra skin in the labia majora, but he said that he can fix that in a minor revision, which is good. i‘ve been wondering if because of the extra surgery time i got more swollen than he was used to... anyways! it will be fine. btw, i also had some trouble with pain during dilation, and he prescribed me a steroid cream that helped a lot. good luck healing! &lt;3

Sounds comparable to my experience with Dr. Ting. Super curious about what Dr. Pang&#39;s results look like. My results weren&#39;t average, and the clitoral hood didn&#39;t stay. As someone who knows how some surgeons work, I&#39;m guessing he tried a certain clitoral hood method on a batch of patients, hopefully, learning it was a bad idea. So I wonder if he has made changes to his practice, and maybe has a revision solution for his patients his method failed on.
</p>
<p>
As someone with a professional perspective, would you say that Dr. Pang has established a good 1-step vaginoplasty results?
<strong>
Did you ask for something, or did he give you his &#34;style&#34;?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Did he tell you to dilate 3 times a day for a full year?
</strong>
That&#39;s the instructions I got from Ting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Have you been, or are you receiving long-term support? Can you talk to Dr. Pang? Did they educate you about your new genitals and how to take care of them?
</strong>
When I saw Ting, I barely heard anything from him, I only had access to the PA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
How did they handle dilation routines?
</strong>
Did they have a plan for certain numbers for a certain time? Did they skip the purple one, and have you on the Blue one immediately? I&#39;m from a different state. In comparison to local trans surgeons, who slowly ramp up dilator numbers, Ting&#39;s team told me to kinda-sorta feel it out with no guidance. Bonus for us: apparently a lot of places don&#39;t even give their patients the big orange dilator.
</p>
<p>
Glad you liked the Mount Sinai setup. I can confirm  NY Eye and Ear Infirmary as an inpatient was great. All the nurses were super gender-affirming.

<p>
i did not ask for anything other than to wake up with not a penis and not a scrotum.  Anything more than that I would have been happy with.  I think that, given that I&#39;ve seen many, many vaginas as part of my job, I recognize that all vaginas are more or less the same led into that desire going into the consultation and surgery.
</p>

Hmm Yes, I think those are the instructions.  I&#39;ll confirm in a couple weeks.

<p>
Hmmm on this one that&#39;s a good question.  Given my background, there was a lot of &#34;you know what to do already&#34;, which is true. In terms of communication, I can talk to them if needed.  In terms of care, they basically told me to wash gently, not using anything to scrub the area for the time being.  They recommended against commercial douches for the time being.  They recommended being careful with incisions and movement to decrease chance of wounds opening up.  I will say that Dr. Pang&#39;s PA, Jim, is phenomenal and I would have no issue talking with him if Dr. Pang was not available.

<p>
Yes, we skipped purple and went straight to blue and green, although like I mentioned I couldn&#39;t tolerate green for the first week.  After the second appointment given my challenges Dr. Pang told me to increase to 30 minutes three times a day.  At this point I&#39;m up to 5 min blue, 5 min green, and 20 min orange.

Make sure you&#39;re on hormones for two years and a year our publicly before the date you want surgery. These requirements may change, they may not. But they are what they are for now.

Wait, I was just looking on WPATH and it says only one year on hormones and out publicly. Is that wrong?

My insurance has separate public and not-public rules for FFS. The public ones say not for &#34;cosmetic&#34; purposes, but the non-public ones basically say they cover all the individual procedures that make up FFS so long as it is for gender transition.
