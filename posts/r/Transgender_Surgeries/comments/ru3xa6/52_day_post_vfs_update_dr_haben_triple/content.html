Thank you for sharing, VFX is a super fascinating procedure. I hadn’t heard of Botox being used before, but it definitely makes sense. Accidental use creating damage would be one of my biggest post op concerns so it is good to know they have a plan for that!
</p>
<p>
What was the “return to work” or socialising like? While VFX is a much smaller operation than GCS it effects an important tool of our day to day lives. How easily could you be heard in a quiet room vs in a noisy bar? Are there limits on how long you can talk, for example are long work meetings out of the question?
</p>
<p>
Sorry if the questions are intrusive! Best of luck on your recovery

No worries, happy to share! It is a really cool procedure.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I was not prepared for how long I would be out of commission for. My work requires me to be able to talk for 20-30 minutes almost continuously, at a volume loud enough that I can be heard across a table over various amounts of background noise, multiple times per day. And at this point almost 2 months out I&#39;m not there yet, which is why I&#39;ve been off work so long. It is a &#34;minor surgery&#34; by most measures, but from the standpoint of just living day to day life, I think this one is going to be the most intense recovery that I will experience, at least from what I&#39;ve read of GCS/BA/FFS. But this could vary a lot depending on your life, if you don&#39;t have to talk much for your job / mostly socialize online it would be a pretty minimal impact for you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been out to restaurants on a few occasions recently, just went out to dinner last night, and a few family gatherings / parties. It&#39;s definitely a struggle sometimes for people to hear me. I can talk for up to about an hour if I&#39;m really careful and use a lot of breath support, but past that my voice gets really tired. I also try not to do this too often as the more I talk the more I am at risk of the stitch breaking which I absolutely do not want.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m expecting improvements in both volume / sound quality / stamina as I heal more.
