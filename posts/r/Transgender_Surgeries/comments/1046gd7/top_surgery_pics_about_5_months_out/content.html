Dr. Sajan of Allure Esthetic in Seattle, WA, btw. Its not letting me edit the post.
</p>
<p>
Went with him because of the positive reviews online and a few here. As it turns out, most of them were fake and the results on his site are photoshopped.

I never want to be the one to be mean to another sister etc, but massaging is not going to be the thing that gets you the look you’re going for. I do think it’s effed up that he said that. I hope you eventually get the results you’re looking for. I’ve had mine for over a year and even when they were 5 months healed one didn’t have my natural tissue dip below the implant/crease. Idk if technique choices matter. I did 700cc mentor second to highest profile silicone under the muscle with inframammary  incision.  I hope any of this insight helps. I know I haven’t posted my results but I’m more than happy to DM them since I don’t have a post with them.

It&#39;s less of a massage and more of a using hands to push the implant down to encourage it to drop.  At least that&#39;s what his directions were.

<p>
Id be grateful for the dm

Honestly it looks like capsular contraction to me. I had one side end up with that, my doctor didn’t want to redo my boobs and kept insisting on massage. That didn’t work. My massage therapist is amazing and we spent a couple of years working on that side. 90% of the capsule has been broken up and the remainder is trapped behind a permanent stitch placed for my benelli lift so it’s inaccessible. The pain was intense, almost as bad as having a chest tube placed.

My CC was firm compared to the other side but not hard, it’s lower than when they were put in but not where it’s supposed to be. This looks like CC to me.

Love and best wishes to you sister and lovely shape though surprised scaring near areola looks painful and wondered why it is there ? Usual approach is under breast so it’s not seen at all and much less risk of sensation loss as well

It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a weird scar from an abscess of several dissolving stitches. This was a lift/augment combo

Yes that&#39;s all I can see of you, which is a side view of your developing breasts that are really beautiful to look at.
</p>
<p>
My breasts are growing out as well, but not as nice and round as yours are.
</p>
<p>
Your a Lucky Lady.
</p>
<p>
I am not able to see your face, but I will admit that your development is very feminine for sure hun.

I’ve seen her on here before. She’s very sweet and super encouraging, but also older and doesn’t grasp the situation fully sometimes. I think that’s what is happening here, she doesn’t understand this is not development but surgery, and is just being blindly supportive which I completely see why you’d be upset by this.
