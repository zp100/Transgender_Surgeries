Hello, Lilia of FT here.
</p>
<p>
As our coordinators and the official published notice has advised, this was a really difficult decision to make but the first priority was to protect our patients, our staff and brace for uncertainties of the future. FT acted quickly, less than 24 hours after the emergency state in Spain was announced on Saturday, March 14th.
</p>
<p>
Staff are currently working under home quarantine until further notice (at least until the end of April) and the HC hospital (or any hospital for that matter) is unavailable at the moment. Subsequent updates are being posted on the same blog link shared by the author of this subreddit - all surgeries until the end of May are either rescheduled or pending a new date when the situation is clarified in patient&#39;s countries, where the pandemic is developing at different rates and border closures are indefinite right now.
</p>
<p>
In any case, please do let your coordinator know if you require further assistance, we remain here to help as best we can. Thanks for your understanding and patience. Check our social media for resources in the meantime about our activity, plans for the future and even talks to continue your research in FFS.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your feedback.

They have now canceled surgeries. Itâ€™s on their Facebook page.

I got the same info from them! About ready to book a date, which feels pointless given the current state of things.
