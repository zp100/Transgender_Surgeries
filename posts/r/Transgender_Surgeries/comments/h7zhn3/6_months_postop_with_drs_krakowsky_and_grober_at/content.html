It&#39;s been quite a while since my previous update at the three week mark (
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/e6jqjg/vaginoplasty_with_dr_krakowsky_and_dr_grober_at/">Index post with other updates.
</a>
), and I&#39;m now about 6.5 months post-op. In the meanwhile, quite a bit has happened, mostly not that great. I had my 3 month exam late February, raised the issues I&#39;d been having with appearance and function, and got some reassurance that a revision was in the cards (Dr. Krakowsky was the one to mention revision first in the appointment, not me, so...) with details to be discussed at my 6 month follow-up, scheduled for May...
</p>
<p>
First off, the big bad news: I seem to have lost the ability to orgasm, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s hormonal, physical, or mental. I tried at the 8 week mark and it worked, followed by yeast, a UTI, and BV-like symptoms.
</p>
<p>
After clearing that up I tried again and it worked, followed by BV-like symptoms and dilation getting really painful. An internal exam revealed a ~2cm patch of granulation. Since then, I&#39;ve tried a few times with external stimulation only, and it either felt nice but not great and went nowhere, or didn&#39;t feel like much at all. I&#39;ve also tried penetrative with a strap on, the first time it felt really good, but not pushing me over the edge... very frustrating. The second time it just felt sore, and dilation started getting sore externally. Most recently, externally, it felt kind of nice but really didn&#39;t do much for me at all.
</p>
<p>
Granulation was not fun to deal with because of COVID, it turned into a ~2.5 month long saga to deal with it. Dilation went from painful, before the granulation was partially under control with steroids, to better but sore externally (after the second round of trying out the strap on and silver nitrate to fully deal with the granulation) to painful again but not sore externally. I&#39;m going to have to try to schedule another internal exam.
</p>
<p>
Simultaneously, I figured out a (partial) work-around for the split hood... medical tape to pull the two sides together. It&#39;s a partial fix only; My hood is still very prominent (ie, it sticks out forward of my majora), so there are still some major sensitivity issues with seams pushing against it (especially while doing things like running) the tape tugs at places sometimes, when the tape comes loose it can jab my clit or my minora, my minora are not happy with being taped all the time, and it sucks mentally confronting it. On the bright side: Better than not taped.
</p>
<p>
COVID has shut down the WCH clinic, so my 6-month was a quick phone appointment to touch base, and a hope that they&#39;d be back to seeing patients in clinic sometime in June, maybe. I know meetings have been had, but no decision has been made yet.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not in a great place mentally with my results, I went in wanting sensation and appearance, with a side order of depth. I currently have painful sensations, appearance that feels mangled to me, and I&#39;m struggling to maintain depth because dilation hurts both mentally and physically. I am hoping that a revision will help, but since I&#39;m non orgasmic right now I just don&#39;t know if I&#39;m screwed or not.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;ll see. I&#39;m on antidepressants now since I started showing depressive symptoms in April and couldn&#39;t manage it on my own. (best guess, combination of hormonal balance and situational bullshit as described above, plus COVID.) I feel broken and I honestly don&#39;t know if I can be put back together well enough or if I&#39;m missing any critical bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
While I&#39;m waiting for WCH to start up clinics again, I&#39;ve reached out to Dr. Wittenberg for at least a second opinion. I&#39;m thinking I may want her to do the revision instead of WCH (if I can get ministry approval.) I don&#39;t have a ton of confidence in WCH, given the results of my primary surgery. I know they want to do well, and I think they will be there eventually, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re there yet and I want someone with a lot more experience in fixing things.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m surviving. There have been lots of tears in the last couple of months.

Thanks for writing this all up! Wish I did something similar. I was their September. Reading through reminded me how awesome the experience was. I&#39;m sorry to hear about the trouble later on :(

Honestly, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. Based on my personal results, and assuming they&#39;re typical, if you were looking at surgery with them in the short term, no. I would look elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
I think they&#39;ve got a great team, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve got the experience yet to consistently produce really solid aesthetic results. Their baseline technique is pretty much Dr. Bowers&#39; technique, so they certainly have the potential, but...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got no idea what the root cause of my anorgasmia is, I have a sensate clitoris and g-spot, so the bits that I need should all be present, but I just can&#39;t get there. So I&#39;m deliberately not going to make a conclusion on that front.
</p>
<p>
If you haven&#39;t already, I&#39;d suggest figuring out what sort of aesthetic results you want and then taking a look for results from other surgeons to see what gets you closest. Shortlist possibilities, and reach out to their offices to see if they&#39;d be willing to work with OHIP.

Hey!! I was their September 2019 patient and just found this thread. It been pretty awesome to read. Just another point of data.
</p>
<p>
So for me everything went flawlessly. My only thing is that I have granulation too. But it is fixable. Covid has made it harder to get treated but nothing im concerned with.
</p>
<p>
WCH is amazing with communication and if something does go wrong they are there for you. I had a few scares and they would get back to me within minutes. I even emailed them this week asking about if I can swim with the granulation and Emery responded in literally 1 minute.

I’m not 100% on the details, but I believe Dr. Powers has been giving his post-op patients low-T topical for dealing with various issues. Might be worth checking out. I’d wager it might help bring your orgasm back, but I’m just speculating.

I&#39;ve read the same. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about it, but I might have a conversation with my endocrinologist. Thanks for reminding me about it. :)
