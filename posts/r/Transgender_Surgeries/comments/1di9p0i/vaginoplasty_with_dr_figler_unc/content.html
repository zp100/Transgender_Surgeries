i got a full depth vaginoplasty six days ago with dr brad figler through the unc transgender healthcare program. when i was looking for surgeons (and choosing him) i struggled to find many resources on him or places to ask questions. if you‚Äôre considering him (or surgery at all) feel free to ask any questions and i‚Äôll do my best to answer them :))
</p>
<p>
the surgery was super smooth, no issues. spent three nights in the hospital and got my catheter and bolster out today. some pain throughout recovery but that‚Äôs to be expected. i have not really gotten a sense of the results so far but he says it looks good at this stage, and he seems like a very competent surgeon. his bedside manner is a little bit lacking, but everyone else on his team makes up for that :)  overall i would recommend him but will update this in a few weeks

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre experience was good! I know NC isn‚Äôt always the most trans-friendly area, so it‚Äôs nice to know there are still options for care there ‚ù§Ô∏è

Glad to hear you are doing well so far. I actually have my surgery with him in 4 weeks. I also have a few friends who have also gone with him and have been pleased.

I have family in MC who would care for me if I went out there.
</p>
<p>
So what method did Dr. Figler perform?
</p>
<p>
How is recovery going so far? How long was your wait between making an appointment for consult and the actual surgery date?
</p>
<p>
Did you need to get electrolysis before surgery?

I believe his method was either a total or scrotal graft vaginoplasty. Recovery has been alright, the first week was hell but since then it has been pretty easy though it is very hard to see how the final results will be still. I am not sure how long the wait usually is, I had my consultation maybe eight months before surgery just because I had to wait for summer break (from university). I only had laser, no electrolysis

sorry to revive this old comment! i had my consult with figler yesterday. im hoping to also not need electrolysis (moneyüò≠). did you get laser locally? do you know about how many sessions you had? ive had 3 so far and i feel like things are starting to clear up pretty well, i just dont know how many i should realistically expect, and itd be nice to have some estimate of a timeframe since i have to wait 5-6 weeks between sessions.

i required 8 or so sessions, and the area was not 100% clear but he checked it ahead of time and said it was fine in terms of hair (it was probably 90-95% gone). I am not sure if I would recommend him as a surgeon in general though

why is that? your post seemed mostly positive. im incredibly limited on options since i need to stay in-network with my insurance. i had my consult with him and everyone seemed positive and friendly, including him

if you‚Äôre comfortable seeing pictures my most recent post more details my thoughts now that everything is healed. (if not, he left far too much erectile tissue which makes it aesthetically unpleasant and painful during arousal). all of his results i have seen look quite varied too, everyone heals differently but he seems to have more variety than normal. i understand the issues w insurance, that is also why i went with him and i do think he is the best option in nc, i just cannot in good faith recommend him anymore

thats fair. i think im at the point where i dont have any other options, so i just have to cross my fingers and hope for the best
</p>
<p>
i think your results look really good tbh! the erectile tissue can be fixed in a revision, but aside from that it looks really good :) i think after a revision youll be super happy, and its not uncommon for people to get revisions, even from celebrity surgeons. i can understand your frustration though ü´Ç‚ù§Ô∏è thank u so much for sharing and i hope it works out okay!
