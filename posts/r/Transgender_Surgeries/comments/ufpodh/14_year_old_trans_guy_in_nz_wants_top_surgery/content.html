Do you have a medical team already in place?  Start with puberty blockers (and without knowing your current situation) and then hopefully you won&#39;t need any kind of major top surgery - especially once they can legally transition you to HRT.

i think i am in a medical team but i told them i didnt need help because i was anxious and my mum had told me just before how expensive it is, sadly i started puberty at 9. 5 years no hormone blockers and they though it would be a waste.

All trans Surgeries are subsidised in NZ. You have to have been on hormones for 2 years and over 18. I think they might&#39;ve changed it but seeing as you&#39;re in Auckland just email Auckland Sexual Health Services and they can point you in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
There are a few surgeons who do top surgery for ftm and only 1 surgeon in NZ who does bottom surgeries for both ftm and mtf, her name is Rita Yang. You can go private and the costs are around 60k nzd as waiting lists for subsidizsd are around 50+ years currently so you&#39;re probably better off going overseas for your bottom surgery which will cost half that.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps, if you need any other specific info feel free to DM me or ask here - I also live in NZ

If find it hard to believe top surgery can cost 60k. Did you get that right?

They said bottom costs 60k, not top. That sounds about right for phallo with testicular and erectile implants.

Yes, thats correct. thats going private. all costs included. the surgery itself is around 50-55k, with the cost of private hospital care  thats about another 5k. totalling 60k. In NZ, anything that isn&#39;t subsidized is very expensive, especially labour. I emailed Ritas clinic asking about this and the repsonse i got back was &#34;This is a reasonable price compared to overseas&#34; which is obviously a lie but it is what it is :(
