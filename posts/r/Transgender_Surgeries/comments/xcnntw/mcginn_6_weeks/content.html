This was just what I needed to read today. Thank you for sharing! I recently scheduled my consult with Dr. McGinn for next year and will be starting hair removal there soon. Her staff has been great so far, and Iâ€™m glad to see it was that way with you for the duration.

Dr. McGinn did a very good job, can I ask you some questions, please it would be very helpful for me (I am considering having my SRS with her or with Dr. Sutin)

I&#39;m sorry if there are many pretensions: How was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos? And if you opt for revision surgery or medical tattooing, What elements of your vulva would you like to improve?, How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

I&#39;d take Sutin over McGinn anyday. I had Sutin very happy. And very humble.

Looks good.   McGinn seems to rarely have patients with problems afterward.  She knows her craft well.

Thank you! Very reassuring! I&#39;ll have mine with her probably in December.
