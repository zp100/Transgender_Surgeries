First thought checking the pics was &#34;wow, that&#39;s going to look so good once the swelling has settled.&#34; One month isn&#39;t much time at all, it&#39;ll transform a lot before you&#39;re done healing, that is such a great look so far.

It looks great, once the swelling goes down it has a decent chance of looking natal

i wrote some time ago a comment where i discussed the various vaginas from the &#39;wall of vagina&#39; project.
</p>
<p>
yours is very much in line with the range of normal cis vaginas... you really have nothing to worry about.  (yours is also, imo, one of the many nice versions of normal)
</p>
<p>
if i have a similar result, i&#39;d be perfectly happy.

cis vulvas come in a wide variety. It doesn&#39;t really look outside that range to me. I hope your dysphoria lessens .

If you don’t mind me asking. With Dr Yang did you have it done privately or publicly. If publicly funded how long was your wait?

Honestly, and not trying to be presumptuous, but my first thought was &#34;I&#39;d lick it.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Like others have said, vulvas come in many diff shapes &amp; sizes. And this one is not only within the expected looks, but it&#39;s pretty cute.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I don&#39;t really believe we should try so hard to &#34;look cis.&#34; I think it&#39;s time for our society to turn the corner and stop hating.

If this is the best that is offered in your country, then come to acceptance. You overcame an intense surgery. I’d recommend accessing mental health services to help with the healing process.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone can reasinably access surgeons like Dr. Min Jun, Dr. BBL, or Dr. Zhao. This is okay.
</p>
<p>
Revisions are available if this continues to give you anxiety. Hold on and be strong.

Be patient and gentle on yourself. You’re going to do great and you will be fine. Stay dedicated on your dialations. And listen to your body. The fantastic thing is: you are now whole!
</p>
<p>
Transition journey is tough. But things get better. Be proud you put down a major milestone! Only those who have crossed that specific path can understand.

I am mistakened. Unfortunately I confused lasthopel for OP.
</p>
<p>
However, it doesn’t change my stance. OP is expressing their anxiety. And they should not be gaslighted (which appears everyone on this thread has done).
</p>
<p>
OP realizes there is an issue with aesthetic. And so everyone lies to accept the result? OP is having anxiety. Rightfully so. Truth is, it is no where near cis looking. But I offer real advice: revisions can be done. This is normal. And OKAY.
</p>
<p>
I also pointed out, if this is their best they can receive in their country, this must be accepted.
</p>
<p>
Even Dr. Wittenberg, whose results I’m not fond of, says there is critical difference between thai and US trends in SRS/GCS. The introitus in Thai surgeries have a “U” shaped appearance. It look like the shaft had been forced into one’s canal.
</p>
<p>
US techniques give the desirable “V” shape. More akin to natal.
</p>
<p>
Bottomline, I’m fascinated watching everyone gaslight OP, instead of being present with their anxiety. Being HONEST and looking for actionable &amp; supportive solutions.
</p>
<p>
The suggestion for mental support is to help them move past their anxieties, come to acceptance, to be brave and emboldened to make right decisions for them. Maybe it involves revision…maybe not…and both are okay.
</p>
<p>
Downvote me all you want. End of the day, I don’t exist in a world where gaslighting is welcomed. Best of luck to y’all.

<p>
Except it is.... I&#39;m a trans guy and aside from some swelling that will go down time, it looks cis to me. I&#39;m starting to think you&#39;ve never seen a cis vagina outside of maybe porn and drawn diagrams. And accusing people who acknowledge that it does look cis of gaslighting someone just because you have some weirdly specific mold of what they should look like is kinda shitty of you.
