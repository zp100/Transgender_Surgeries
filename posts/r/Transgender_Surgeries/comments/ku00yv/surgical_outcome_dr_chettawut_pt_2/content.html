Thanks :) I&#39;m happy with what I&#39;ve got, but I&#39;d be dumb to say it&#39;s the best results I&#39;ve ever seen, and my depth is miserable. Thought it wouldn&#39;t bother me as a lesbian...but ya girl wants the strap, what can I say :(

I’m sorry you’re not completely satisfied, for what’s it’s worth I think your vulva is stunning. I appreciate you sharing your results.
</p>
<p>
We don’t really get many folks sharing their results beyond a year so it’s nice to see how things still change. I hope that you were at least satisfied with the way Chettawut treated you and how he handled any issues you had while you were there.

I’m happy to have a vagina, and if this is the one I die with I’ll continue to be over the moon. But that doesn’t mean I’m not left pining for more.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, he was very nice, although it weirds me out that you only see him maybe 3-4 times in your whole stay. The nurses were lovely, and to this day I still remember them fondly. The ones that come out to the hotels were also nice, although a bit more bossy and grumpy sometimes (they were really busy, so it’s understandable). My only gripe with Chett’s performance outside of the actual surgery is he can tend to be very dismissive. Not in an unkind way, but in a frustrating way. He’s dismissive of most issues and tells you it’s fine. He’s very warm and empathetic though, which was nice. He held my hand while I fell unconscious and made sure I was ok, because I’d never gone under anaesthetic before and was freaking out a bit. He’s a nice guy, I just don’t know how I feel about his results.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how has your recovery been so far? What made you choose Dr. Chettawut over other Doctors? Do you recommend Dr. Chettawut? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to have a labiaplasty or revision surgery (it&#39;s one of the best results I&#39;ve seen from him)? How is your vaginal depth? How was your stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Chettawut&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried soul dilators? And if you used them, is there any advantage? and by the way many congratulations on your surgery and the happiness it brought you

Chose Chett for price, sensation (external), looks and availability (I got booked in and under the knife within a month and half).
</p>
<p>
Do I recommend him? Hmm...tough to say. His results regarding external sensation are good. And his external work is subjectivity good too (in hindsight I’m not as big a fan, but eh). But he has a frequent habit of giving girls less depth than they expect (painful when you also have to spend the extra $800 or whatever it is for a skin graft for inside that likely doesn’t even get used anyway due to the low depth. External aesthetics are almost always quite wonky or asymmetrical too. He’s a very nice man but can be too dismissive or issues or concerns.
</p>
<p>
I may have a revision at some point, possibly for external aesthetics but mostly because I want depth badly. I also would like some form of self lubrication
<em>
before
</em>
orgasming (I get wet af after I cum, if it ever happens). So I may go to someone else for a Peritoneal technique revision, but it depends on logistics and most of all, cost.
</p>
<p>
My depth is shit. I had ~4” of depth when I started, and now over 2 years later I’ve got about 3”, maybe 3.5” at a push (ouch). It’s enough to get fingers into, but makes strap-on sex scary and daunting. Haven’t tried it yet (in this opening anyway). I feel like I basically got the non-vaginal labiaplasty at times with how shit I feel about my depth, and it definitely is something I initially made peace with but now has come back to really upset me fairly frequently.
</p>
<p>
Chett’s aftercare whilst in Thailand is good. After you get on the plan I would say it is...moderate to decent. It’s not great, and his dismissiveness comes into play here. But it’s serviceable.
</p>
<p>
I’ve not tried SS dilators, however are those the tapered one or the non-tapered cylindrical ones? Because if it’s the latter, Chett’s dilators he gives you are basically the same thing.

I&#39;m so sorry to ask this. What was your length before? I&#39;ve been wanting to book Chett in the future because doctors around my part of the world don&#39;t exactly offer more than 4&#34; of depth
<em>
anyway.
</em>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not even sure if it matters because of Chett&#39;s technique, but I thought I&#39;d ask for your opinion/insights/experience.

I think this is a reasonable question, I don’t know why you’re being downvoted. Around 6” erect before surgery, maybe 5 by the time I got surgery. I wasn’t overly concerned with measuring my dick on the regular...

These days, I scarcely notice. It’s just..normal. My life day to day is pretty normal with relation to my downstairs bits. But the first time I put my skinny jeans on to travel home from Thailand...oh boi! That was a trip and a half. Brain was like “there’s too much room. Where is the constriction. What is happening. Everything feels simultaneously wrong and right. Agghhhhh”. The biggest thing is just being able to pull a dress on and the only worry be if my arse cheeks hang out the back, not “will my dick flop out”. Phantom limb syndrome has all but gone away, although interestingly if I delve down any porn alleys and view anything to do with trans people, my brain does revert to thinking I have a penis and going to masturbate it, only to be taken aback for a second that it’s not there. That’s always weird. Doesn’t happen to me with guys (not that my gay ass watches anything with guys in it), only trans girls/enbies.

Yeah, I can understand. I&#39;ve never done it either and dreading even the consultations right now.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, thank you so much for your response. I&#39;ll really take your experience into account because to go to Chett, I have to save
<em>
up
</em>
, rather than down. My currency is weaker compared to THB, unlike GBP being more powerful compared to THB. That is to say, it&#39;s too stressful - and I don&#39;t want to spend the money only to get the same outcome I could have gotten for 1/3rd the money domestically.

Gosh it’s so beautiful. I had always heard Chettawut has the most ascetically pleasing results. What is your depth? I’m gay too and have been thinking that depth isn’t the most important thing for me. I just want to feel normal.  How long was it till you could have sex with your partner?

I started at 4”, it’s optimistic to say I have 3.5” now, more like 3” realistically. You think it won’t matter, but that day when you realise you want your girlfriend to look into your eyes as she penetrates you and you can’t, not without finding some 4” dildo (quite hard to find to be honest). Also, penetration is weird for me. If I do it after dilating (fingering) it’s alright, but I don’t particularly like movements in and out. But if I haven’t dilated first, fingers kinda hurt me. In fact, to be honest anything ribbed or not entirely smooth hurts or feels uncomfortable. But smooth things like dilators? Stick it in me please &lt;3

I know they have this thing called the OhNut and while it&#39;s meant for penises I&#39;m sure it works fine on dildos too as it&#39;s just meant to limit the amount of depth, not sure if that would help fulfill something you want to do but it could be worth a try!

I’m so worried about depth I wonder if anything can be done before hand to give a little extra. My penis is so small while flaccid wick has made it someone easy to hide but I’m worried about how my depth will work.

Afraid I don’t know currently, sorry. He charged me ~$11,640 plus another ~£800 for a skin graft. Prices will likely have gone up a smidge since then.

Thank you for sharing. I am planning to have my surgery with Dr Chettawut later this year so your post is very very helpful!
</p>
<p>
Just some questions, 1) How long do you think you can get back to work? It concerns me that it&#39;s still not fully healed at 3 months from your post; 2) You mentioned that the external sensation is okay, what about it inside the vagina? I thought PI surgeries usually preserves some sensations inside; 3)Any issues about reaching orgasms? If you don&#39;t mind me asking.

1) Depends on the job. I was going to sit at desks and walk between rooms so I was fine. But I also worked part time at IKEA and I couldn’t get back to work for about 2-3 months post-op, at which point they put me on the returns desk with a stool to lean/sit on, and allowed me to wear comfier trousers than the uniform. Definitely would have been a solid 3-4 months before I felt up to anything heavy labour related, that’s for sure.
</p>
<p>
2) Sensation inside is meh. It’s there, but it’s more like the feeling of my insides being moved around if I try to wiggle my fingers about. Just sensation itself, pretty low.
</p>
<p>
3) Yes and no. Initially I tried masturbating with vibrators, thought “this is amazing, I must be doing it right”. Turned out I was just getting close and enjoying the ride (which is fine and healthy, don’t get me wrong). After a while I managed to experience a real orgasm, and...wow. I cannot express how earth shattering that was. Had to lay there for like 20-30 mins afterwords panting. It feels exactly like an old, presurgical one, but turned up to 11 and then some, with the knob broken. That being said, as I got better at getting them, my satisfaction from them has waned. I now feel very little different from my presurgical orgasms, it’s just way more time consuming and difficult to reach than before. So that’s something I’d say I’m dissatisfied with by this point. It’s possible it’s something to do with my hormones though, but since I’m with the NHS there’s absolutely nothing I can do about that, they are relatively useless for anything nuanced to do with trans healthcare. I cannot come by someone else, although I’ve only tried with my current partner. She cannot make me come, and I cannot make myself come around her without significant stress and difficulty. I think that’s a mental thing more than a physiological thing though.

Glad I could help. I dunno how I don’t have bad scarring to be honest, my scars from BA are worse than that. I used a bit of bio oil for a while, but got bored and didn’t see it doing much. Mostly just used my usual Body Shop body butter (it’s scented, so do not apply too close to the opening or inner labia). As far as I’m aware, it’s all about keeping it hydrated. Moisturise your skin ladies, gents and folks. Should do that anyway, not just for surgery.

Hi. I’m hoping to have srs this year and I‘ve been considering Chettawut. I’ve been having second thought recently as I’ve heard about some bad results. This looks like a decent result, but I’m concerned about your review of Chett, especially regarding the depth. I’ve always thought that Chett gave good depth, however I wonder how many of his patients have shallow depth? I’m open to other Thai surgeons though. Do you now wish that you had used another Thai surgeon and if so which one? It’s confusing for me as I decided on Chett a few years ago.

I haven’t researched enough since the surgery to firmly say I would’ve picked someone else. Other surgeons also tend to lean on the pricier side of things. That being said, the depth is my biggest regret, as I firmly believe a more capable surgeon may have been able to give me the appropriate depth. I was told it was due to swelling between the bowel and bladder, and that it was unsafe to try and make a tunnel. But that’s the first I’d heard of something like that, and considering 2 other girls I know of whilst I was at the hotel (one of three hotels) had low depth too, I think he just had a bad week/month and blamed it on my insides being uncooperative. It causes me a lot of distress to be honest, but outside of that I’m reasonably happy with the results. I’m glad to have a vagina and feel more regular and “normal” (I don’t like using that term, but it’s the most fitting to describe my feelings), but things definitely could be better I reckon. I’m currently contemplating a peritoneal revision to gain depth, but that’s a long way away.

Somebody else said something similar about Chett, it was worse though as she ended up with zero depth. I have the link as I was reading about it recently (I’ve been reading a fair a bit about his results recently). With what you said about other girls having the same issue with depth at the same time as you has really concerned me. Especially as this other post mentions that he gives up too easily. I really don’t want to mess around getting a revision after.

Getting a revision with some depth might be alright (it better be, I want it) since you’re just adding to the length with some peritoneal tissue or skin grafts etc. With zero depth though, that poses some issues, as using peritoneal tissue for an entire canal would lead to quite significant lubrication I’d think. More than you would feasibly want, thought that’s subjective.
</p>
<p>
If I had woke up with zero depth I think I would actually have broken down. I kept it together because I knew I had enough depth for fingers and that tided me by. Yes I’m left pining for now currently, but at least I’ve got something. No depth would definitely has shattered my resolve I think.

Yes you are definitely better off than that poor lady, zero depth is awful. I do agree that peritoneal tissue would be great for lubrication, in fact I have considered ppt before now, it’s just a shame that so few surgeons offer it. Well I’m currently in contact with Chetts office (Som) and I was going to book as soon as I had my Covid vaccination, but I’m going to have to have a serious think about it. This could be a recurring problem with his surgeries. It was interesting what was said in that post above, about how a simple ultrasound would have told him that he would have been unable to create a canal. Maybe he’s just rushing surgeries? I really don’t know.

I’ve wondered about the ultrasound too, or some sort of scan. It would be relevant for a future revision, as I don’t want to go under the knife and spend money to do so, making myself heal and frequently dilate all over again, only to gain 0.5” in the end because Chett was telling the truth. It would be nice to know beforehand so I know if I’m wasting time/money looking into all these surgeons.

Mention that to any prospective future surgeon and if they dismiss the idea pick another surgeon. Regarding Chett, I found out something interesting today.....Suporn has come out of retirement! He was always my first choice, so I’ve contacted his office to make enquires. My BMI is 30 so I’m going to try and lose some weight, having said that he will probably just charge me more if I don’t.

Thank you! There’s debate here about what that is, whether it’s the urethra or leftover erectile tissue. Waiting to try peeing in the shower before I have a looksie. Would be nice to know, since the gyno wasn’t any use.
</p>
<p>
Edit: it is, in fact, not the urethra. Watched as I peed with a mirror, not a drop came from anywhere near it.

Another commenter has informed me it may not actually be my urethra, but some erectile tissue leftover. Otherwise...I dunno. Gyno was no use.

Edit: it was not, in fact, the urethra.

I’m not entirely surprised the gyno wasn’t able to help honestly. I’d imagine they’ve got all the bits that are the same as a cis woman’s vagina and vulva covered but if it’s something like extra erectile tissue, unless there’s some extra training they’ve taken about us, trans stuff isn’t going to be their thing. Maybe there’s someone who specializes in post-op trans care?

In the NHS? Hehe, funny. I ask them about trans stuff and they look at me like I speak Swahili, or like I just swore and their face with extra spittle...

That’s what I thought, but this person had Chett as well and went to another SRS surgeon later who said it’s erectile tissue.

That’s a disgusting, absolutely great idea! Never thought of that, I’m going to try that next time I’m in the shower. I wanna know once and for all if that’s my urethra or leftover penis bits

Not OP but thank you for this! I&#39;ve been considering Dr. Chettawut and to me personally, that sounds like a real plus if there is any chance of that urethral positioning helping with vaginal wetness.

Ah, the UTIs, such fun. I’ve had 3 in a 4 month timespan at one point. I’m taking supplements now, so I don’t get them very often now, but boi was it bad

To be honest, I haven’t noticed any wetness in the vagina outside or regular sweat because it’s a hot, dark moist area of the body. But when orgasming everything becomes slipperier than black ice in the winter, and I’m practically dripping. I just wish it would happen beforehand, but maybe that’s to do with the urethra being there.

I see, thank you for sharing this. I know wetness really depends from person to person and time to time and can shift one way or another with HRT and GRS, but since I (pre GRS) get very wet, I suppose I have a bit of wishful thinking regarding that, as I plan for a GRS that doesn&#39;t use peritoneal/colon tissue.

<p>
For what it&#39;s worth, I do often see sex advice along the lines of &#34;have her cum before penetration so she&#39;s more ready/comfortable for penetrative sex&#34; even for cis women.
</p>
<p>
Please pardon my rudeness, I hadn&#39;t commented on your main post to thank you for sharing your results, and so comprehensively at that. I really, really appreciate it and love the spirit of passing it forward too. And I am just one person but I think yours looks incredibly beautiful.
</p>
<p>
Of course your happiness is what matters and I am glad that you&#39;re ultimately okay with your result and I do not mean to dismiss any of your grievances. Still though, regarding colour, symmetry and all, it&#39;s so in line with the vulvae in that big gallery of cis ones that was on here (I think?) a while back too.

Yeah, that might be a good shot if it weren’t for the fact I currently can’t cum with my girlfriend. Puts a spanner in the works for that one.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, I’m glad I could be helpful to others :) I needed to see loads of before/afters to make my decisions, so it’s only fair I add my experiences to the mix.

Aww I am really sorry about that! I do think there is too much of an emphasis on climaxes in sexual activities when that isn&#39;t the most realistic thing sometimes for lots of women, cis or trans (and men and enbies too) but yeah that would be nice to have.
</p>
<p>
At least, just because it&#39;s not possible for you for now doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it will remain that way indefinitely, right? I hope that things keep on improving for you! 🤞
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still discovering new things about my sexuality and my body&#39;s responses to it, and it really is a life-long journey I think.
</p>
<p>
Thank you again!

It was indeed not the urethra. Just had a shower with a mirror. Not a drop came from that “hole”.
