Im thinking of getting a BBL in the future, cause I have very little natural curves even after being on HRT for 2 1/2 years. Would it be recommended/easier to have the procedure done after bottom surgery? I was planning to do the BBL before bottom surgery as I want bottom surgery to be
<em>
final
</em>
surgery since it is going to be the most expensive and hardest surgery to recover from, but my CIS friend stated I may have a hard time finding a surgeon if I donâ€™t have bottom surgery before the BBL.

I donâ€™t think your cis friend knows what theyâ€™re talking about at all.

As another redditor said, your friend is definitely not correct on their warning. I&#39;ve had FFS &gt; Hip augmentation w/360 lipo &gt; fat grafting around my hips and butt &gt; breast augmentation.
</p>
<p>
And in November I&#39;m having bottom surgery. There is no right or wrong way to the order of these surgeries. Instead it&#39;s moreso about everyone&#39;s own personal journey and what path they choose. In my own transition I started with FFS for my own psychological comfort, and I&#39;m ending with bottom surgery because once I wake up after the operation I just want to be done with it all.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck on your surgeries ok?? ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° you&#39;ll do great!

It depends on the surgeon. Dr Bank has put out a notice saying they may stop seeing patients who have had BBLs because of the way it changes blood vessels in the groin area.
</p>
<p>
I had a BBL before Srs with Bank and he said I lost a lot of blood, and that sometimes it can cause other complications with the graft. Thankfully I didnâ€™t get any, but itâ€™s definitely not a sure fire thing.

Itâ€™s in the Astra discord for Bank patients and based on my own convos with Bank, but looking at the announcement in the discord I think it was sent via email to a patient? So not sure itâ€™s like a fully official thing yet

Its the first I&#39;ve heard of this kind of thing. I wonder if its going to turn into a big issue.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s that many trans women having bbl followed by srs. I&#39;ve only come across a few.

Yeah, he said I was mostly fine because I had a fairly mild one. And specifically it was about going up through the Mons pubis for lipo that was the issue, so it definitely depends. Also Bank has such a unique technique so may just be him. Hopefully itâ€™s not an issue for others!

Have you heard of anything new related to this? I&#39;m specifically looking at getting body contouring/bbl prior to ffs which will be prior to srs in spring 2026

Did you lose any depth before of that? Their email to me say that It will be less than 5 inches because of that. But I already got bbl done 4 years ago

Sorry for late reply! I have full depth (16.5cm). YMMV but I think theyâ€™re probably just hedging their bets just in case and hoping to over deliver

Keep in mind weight gain can be much easier after bottom surgery. I got a simple orchi done a week ago, and my body contouring is about 3 months away. The more fat you have to transfer, the more dramatic your results, so keep that in mind.

Zoah!! Its from the uk! Dre sign by grabs too. I usually wear m but I find xs is the most flat and secure. Zoah the best! I used it for two years until I had my SRS. Life saving.
