I would be very, very careful having colon surgery if you have any connective tissue disorder. I don’t have EDS but I probably have some sort of connective tissue issues in my family and had to get genetic testing based on a history of heart issues and my PS finding oddly “stretchy” skin while doing my BA. When I had my ascending colon vaginoplasty they had a hard time keeping it in and I had a few revisions for prolapse….and keep in mind I have a minor issue they don’t even know the genetic sequencing for. I believe I talked to somebody else that had a much more severe problem with repeated prolapses that necessitated a complete removal. I just don’t know that there’s any technique that’s going to be safe, but please of course talk to your various physicians.
