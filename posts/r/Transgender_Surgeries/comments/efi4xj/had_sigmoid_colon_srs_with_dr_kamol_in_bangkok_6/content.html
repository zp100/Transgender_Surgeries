Hi everyone! I&#39;m Nicole, 39y old, from Germany, and I had started my transition on April 2017. I&#39;m not all too active in these forums any more, but since they were such an important and formidable source of information, experience xchange and support at the beginning of my transition, I thought doing an AMA would be a good way to give sth back to the community.
</p>
<p>
I also had done hair transplant [Dr. Doganay, Analya] and VFS [Dr. Kim, Yeson Center, Seoul] so far, so if there are questions regarding these surgeries, I&#39;ll happily answer them too.
</p>
<p>
To sum it up, why the sigmoid colon surgery? Mainly because I wanted the guaranteed depth, which does not collapse when you don&#39;t do dilation [you still need dilation at the beginning, but that&#39;s not for depth maintenance, but for the narrow opening to widen and relax], and the self-lubrication. Results I consider closest to a natal vagina, so I don&#39;t have any issues with or even get outed during PIV sex. Why with Dr. Kamol? Experience. He is performing SRS [all procdures, PI, scrotal and colon] over 20+ years now, and he basically built his own hospital to concentrate doing just this, so I was quite confident that he knows very well what he is doing, and with such an experienced doctor and staff, risks will be minimal, and in case sth unexpected happens, proper support will be available all the time.

Hi. I’m Rhenna. Currently on E and planning srs as money allows. I hear one complaint with the outlined procedure is the smell of the secretion that acts as the natural lubrications. Some say it is unpleasant. What are your feelings?  Thank you! R

No, smell is not unpleasant, also haven&#39;t had any complaints about smell from men licking it, but I&#39;m also washing my vaginal canal regularly (ideally daily, but I&#39;m more in the range evry 2-4 days). If I leave it unwashed for over a week or so, then it gets somewhat smelly, yes. Idk how well that part compares to cis vaginas, but I treat it like a hygiene thing, anything on your body that you don&#39;t wash for a long time will smell eventually.

I have to imagine that there&#39;s a strong possibility of a lingering scent at first, but I also have to assume that the entire graft will shed its epithelial lining like most tissue.

&#34;I am glad I can help.  When I was in your situation I was frustrated with the lack of information online about this surgery.  There is also a lot of misinformation too.  For example people seem to have this misconception that the discharge smells like poo for a while because it was colon tissue.  Now that I’ve had this surgery, I can say that is completely untrue.  It has never smelled like poo, not even the first few days of recovery in the hospital.  The colon tissue is thoroughly cleaned before the surgery and so there is no poo smell.&#34;

Same, sigmoid colon vaginoplasty is truly the sweet spot of all the options.

Same with me actually, I&#39;m considering the sigmoid colon to be strictly the best option in all areas of outcome. What needs considering is basically added risk because of the additional surgical site at the colon, and the harder recovery with staying off food/drink for 3 days, then slowly working your way up from soups, to soft food for one month. But since the results are for lifetime, I didn&#39;t have to think twice and went for the sigmoid colon.

I&#39;ll have to check the other ama, pretty sure there was no issue at any time.

<p>
Maybe tmi, but after bowel prep for surgery there was no smell on my finger when i administered rectal drugs ... although, that&#39;s not the sigmoid colon.

Some people equate the smell of digestion to the colon all the time.. They can&#39;t seem to understand that the section used for that had nothing to do with digestion.

The organizing procedure was basically as follows: Via e-mail communication I asked for possible surgery dates, waiting time was ~3 months. They needed some up-to-date bloodwork and hormone levels. For the sigmoid variant I needed to not be overweight, otherwise this surgery can&#39;t be performed. I did the money transfer in advance [in general, you can also pay, when you are there, but I prefer doing the payments in advance to not get into technical issues and your bank can&#39;t help you in time because you are far away from home] and booked the flight. I was asked to cut taking hormones and to cut eating fibers 2 weeks before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Total cost of the surgery was ~17500€. I did the most expensive variant, which is the laparoscopic one. It leaves you with 4 very small and barely noticeable scars, that are just getting healed away. There is also the &#34;open&#34; procdure, which is considerably cheaper, but for this, your abdomen area will be cut open and you&#39;ll be left with a longer scar across your belly area [similar to cesar&#39;s cut]. Total cost includes all surgery costs, anesthesia, staying in the hospital for one month, including the days from your arrival till surgery [no hotel needed], post OP care in the hospital and beyond [emailing any questions/issues you may have, appointment with Dr. Kamol for a checkup when he is on a visit near your country]. What is not included in these costs is the flight and any extras you buy o eat and drink during your stay.
</p>
<p>
The first 3 days before surgery ar paperwork [registration], physical examination, appointment with a psychiatrist in the hospital [Thai law requires this, but it is just a small and uncomplicated appointment, and you are legally clear for SRS], talk and pre-OP checkup with Dr. Kamol. For surgery day I was asked to not eat and drink, had enemas done by a nurse on an hourly basis from early morning till noon, to ensure colon is cleansed thoroughly, was then transferred from the apartment room to the hospital room. Early afternoon I was taken to the surgery room. Last question: &#34;You want SRS, are you sure?&#34;. &#34;Yes, please!&#34;. Anesthesia mask was put on - my last pre-OP memory.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards I woke up in the wakeup-room, I was dizzy and although no pain, I immediately felt that I have to keep my legs spread apart widely. Which brings me to the no.1 problem when post-OP: lying on the hard bed with very limited ways to change position was very uncomfortable. Few hours later I was transferred back to my room in the hospital. There I was to stay for 6 days. The first 3 days strictly no eating, no drinking, I got nourished intravenously. After 3 days I could start drinking little and eat, but only soups. Dr. Kamol came for checkup twice during that time, otherwise the daily routine was: nurses do wash your body and change clothes while you are lying in bed at the morning, and twice a day they change dressing on the surgery site, clean your new vagina and apply creams to prevent any infections. Again, pain on the vagina was a non-issue, but lying on the hard clinic bed, legs spread wide all the time with nearly no ways to move, was literal &#34;pain in the ass&#34; over time, and sleeping was difficult too. The stay in the clinic was from my POV the hardest, most difficult part of the surgery. Finally, after 6 days, I was transferred back to my apartment room. I was the able to walk and move around a little, the bed was larger and more comfy, so everything got a bit more relaxed. Sitting was a challenge, but the clinic gave me a donut pillow, which helped well. Day nine after surgery I got my foley removed. A somewhat not-so-pleasant procedure, since they require you to drink much water, so you can pee &#34;on command&#34; 3 times and once more just when the foley is removed to ensure you can pee normally afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Near 2 weeks after surgery the daily program consists of dilation twice a day. You go to the dilation room, the nurse cleans your vagina, puts the dilator in, and you are required to keep it in for one hour [having a smartphone with you for killing time helps ;D]. Afterwards, the nurse performs cleaning again, applies anti-infectional creams and you are good to go. Every week a bigger sized dilator is used until it reaches 3 inch diameter. At the beginning I was not able to leave the hospital to buy food/drink, so the nurses bought stuff for me and brought it to my room. I was only allowed to eat soups at the beginning and slowly and gently move to soft food to not risk any constipation in the colon area. For the whole stay I was required to not eat fibers, but at the end of my stay I could eat soft cakes, ice cream etc. without issues. One of the most pleasant experiences there: Once I was able to move around freely, I met many transwomen from all over the world there at the hospital, and we had many good conversations and with some I&#39;m still in close contact. In the last few days the nurses taught us how to do washing and dilation ourselves, and then Time arrived to say goodbye to the wonderful staff and the other patients there and fly back. For the flight I got a document from the clinic stating that I had SRS in case I needed a different sat or any help from the flight personnel. It wasn&#39;t the case for me, but my flight was long [11 hrs], and I stood up frequently and moved around a litle, since sitting for so long wasn&#39;t comfortable for me.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward, at home I continue my dilation routine once a day. I tried PIV sex a few times ~4mo post-OP, and, although it was pleasant, plenty of depth was just there, and I didn&#39;t need lubrication, just as expected, it was still a bit early: the opening was still narrow, a bit more waiting and dilation was neded. I&#39;ll try again in the new year ;D but from what I feel now, the opening wided well and relaxed fine. Besides that, I&#39;m very happy with the results: feeling, aesthetics, depth, lubrication, everything is pleasant. And finally no more male sex organs and no more T producing balls ;D
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s my experiences so far. Ask any question you may have; and for those who celebrate it: merry Christmas and ad a happy new year!

Nice write up.. How long did you stay in Thailand for the surgery?  Was it three weeks?   Was the wait list 3 months or less?  When I emailed them they said they can work within 1 month wait..     How are your bowel movements now?    Is dilation painful ?

I stayed a bit longer than one month, like near 5 weeks, which caused me some extra cost, because staying in Thailand longer than 30 days means you need to pay for visa, but I wanted to be on the safe side and have a full month for post-OP care in the hospital. In retrospect, that wasn&#39;t needed, but better be safe than sorry.
</p>
<p>
I asked 3 months in advance for a surgery date in June, so yea it may well be that the wait time is actually less.
</p>
<p>
Bowel movement improved for me to my surprise actually. I was chronically constipated before surgery and now I poop regularly and the poop comes out fast.

Thanks for info..  was there a seperate colon specialist doing the colon cut?  Did they talk about risk of colon infection and possible need for colostomy bag?   I heard that is one risk with colon srs?     How hard is it with no food drink for 3 days

Yes, they have dedicated surgeons who do the sigma extraction and colon anastomosis. Before surgery, there was talk about risks, both on vagina and colon part of the surgery, and you have to sign that you understood the risks and want to go for surgery. I haven&#39;t had any  colostomy bag mentioned though, though infection was metioned.
</p>
<p>
&gt;  How hard is it with no food drink for 3 days
</p>
<p>
Not so hard. I got nourished intravenous, so didn&#39;t feel hungry or thirsty. Occasional headaches, which were bearable, I was told this comes from hunger, but didn&#39;t feel desire to eat or drink. The hardest part by far for me was lying on the hard bed with very little abilities to move (legs had to be spread wide, belly couldn&#39;t also be moved because of fresh laparoscopic incissions) and no way to change position.
</p>
<p>
&gt; Do u think 3 weeks is enough of stay?
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is possible. A friend of mine I met there, also from Germany, stayed 3 weeks for her colon SRS and all went fine. Though, if you have the choice, go for 4 weeks, to be on the safe side. With 3 weeks, maybe arrange that the pre-OP lab tests and paperwork happen in day 1 and surgery happens as soon as possible afterwards and cut on going for sightseeing prior to SRS.

Wow,good to know.  Did you travel for SRS by yourself?   When did you resume normal work and phyisical activity?  Was orgasm possible within the first month?  Is it mostly at the clitoral or vaginal also?   Seems like it is a huge advantage with an inhouse dilation station where the nurses do it for you!!!       Any pictures when you get a chance would be great..      Just saw the pics looks great...   Sorry for all these questions. I am seriously wanting to go to Kamol and deciding between PAI and Kamol!!!

<p>
Yes. Most went there by themselves, but I also met a girl that had her friend for company, which is ofc great if you aren&#39;t alone during all this, but also is no problem logistically: the arpartment rooms are for two (two beds or a double bed).
</p>

<p>
I first orgasmed quite late, sevral months in, thaough that was more of a mind issue for me (before SRS I could only imagine being woman in bed in my sexy fantasies, after SRS my desire to dream around wasnt there anymore and I had to re-learn sexy antasizing somewhat ;D). It worked for me by rubbing and gently pushing around the clitoral area. I think though, that during first month would be too early. There the vagina is busy with healing ;D

<p>
Yes, I hadn&#39;t expected it and I was amazed too about this! What&#39;s also good: that way the nurses check your new vagina every day, so if there&#39;s any issue with the surgical site, they can inform the doctor immediately. Second quite good thing that surprised and amazed me was meeting so many transwomen from all continents there (Brazil, Korea, Italy, even from South Africa, and Katar were there), most were quite young and beautiful and have had their post-transition daily life firrmly established, so there was plenty of interesting experience exchange;D

<p>
nah, no need to feel sorry, it is an AMA after all ;D PAI is Dr. Preecha, right? If I&#39;m informed correctly, Dr. Preecha and Dr. Kamol at some point worked together until Dr. Kamol went on establishing his own hospital. So I can imagine, there isn&#39;t big difference between their surgery techniques.

Did you experience any belly buldge?   Is Dilation painful at all?  What about the ring of scar contraction? Do you just keep dilating to prevent that from tightening?

<p>
umm, what&#39;s that? Nothing unusual to my belly shape though. If my belly expands, then because some times I&#39;m too stupid to keep my diet, but entirely not surgery related ;D
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
No and it is getting easier with time. When upsizing the dilator, it is a bit painful at the beginning of the dilation session, but the opening gets used to it with subsequent dilations.

<p>
Basically yes, or, at some point I&#39;m hoping to have regular sex ;D Can&#39;t tell though if dilation is a lifetime thing, but I think the opening might get used to being more relaxed one year in or so.

Are you satisfied with sensation and the aesthetic result of the vulva (Labia majora/minor, clitoral hood, urethra positioning etc.)?

Definitely yes! I can post a picture by time, but as far as my opinion goes, I&#39;m very happy with sensation and appearance, and for sure I&#39;m not considering any further touchups or corrective surgeries down there. Actually, I don&#39;t know where exactly my urethra is, but I&#39;m peeing in a straight line, so I guess that part is fine ;D

I&#39;ve heard the

continuous

discharge can be a problem? How is it day to day, and are there activities that seem to cause more? Six months in, how is the discharge at its worst?

Same as my answer to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/taylort2019/">taylort2019
</a>
, the first few weeks post-OP there was more discharge (not unmanageable), but it needed some planning ahead, like extra underwear, changing pads etc. Now it is a non-issue in my daily life, I may have a bit of discharge immediatly after dilation, which I&#39;m wiping off, otherwise the pads in my underwear have only little discharge to catch during the day from morning till evening - if I change them, then to feel more clean down there, not because they got too wet. Long story short: discharge got normalized 6mo in.

Do you get too wet without stimulation or that&#39;s also a myth?

I&#39;m not all too experienced with sex yet to give a definitive answer, but with stimulation by dilation the inner canal gets a bit more wet and putting out and reinserting dilator gets easier after few minutes. Also: I got considerably more wet when I was fresh after surgery and basically needed to change underwear and pads often, but now, 6mo after, things normalized and discarge is much less compared to freshly post-OP, and is no longer an issue in my daily life.

yes, a little bit secretion is coming out, with tendency to be more after washing. So, I&#39;m not completely dry, but secretion is a non-issue in everyday life, really, I just put in a fresh pad in the morning to protect my underwear and that&#39;s it.

After 6mo only very little is coming out , with tendency to be more after washing. I&#39;m putting in a pad in the morning to protect my undies, since I&#39;m not completely dry, but it is a non-issue in my everyday life, i.e. I&#39;m not thinking about &#34;omg maybe I&#39;m too wet, need to change pads/undies&#34; stuff like that.

Hi again..   After surgery could you walk a bit or you had to lie on your back for 1 whole week with little movement?     Did they try to steer you to skin graft vs colon or they were open to doing colon graft without question?

After surgery I had to lie on my back for 1 whole week with little movement, pretty much that. Legs apart all the time, and add to it 3 days no eating, no drinking, and afterwards only little soups. The good news is, pain and hunger were not really an issue (they were well under control with painkillers and intravenous nourishing), main &#34;enemies&#34; for me were PITA because position gets uncomfortable with time, and &#34;killing&#34; time, i.e. boredom ;D
</p>
<p>
And no, they completely welcomed to my wish for sigmoid vaginoplasty, they didn&#39;t try to convince me for the more &#34;traditional&#34; methods. Even contrary, they are convinced themselves that the colon method is superior due to more depth, guaranteed depth and lubrication (i.e. vagina not collapsing). I know only of one case where Dr. Kamol convinced the patient for traditional skin graft over colon, and it was due to her being 70 years old (a wonderful lady btw, and a good example that age should not stop anyone) and having diabetes, so the colon surgery would have been too risky.
