Things are going steady. I feel like my labia is becoming better and better i keep getting these nerve zaps from nerves reconnecting they last about 30 seconds at most.
</p>
<p>
I masturbated quite a lot lately using external and internal stimulation but only using fingers. Im able to achieve both clitoral and vaginal orgasms , the clitoral ones usually are dry but the vaginal ones leave me and my bedding wet its not squirting although im capable of that i was pre surgery too with g spot stimulation is just the lubrication being a lot that it drips out and makes a mess i personally love it its so affirming. During fingering if i stimulate my g spot i feel it swelling up and i feel the urge to pee mixed with the feeling of orgasm building up. Im quite stretchy i could easily fit 2 fingers inside me i didnt expect it, i think that is because colon is the same tissue as a cis vagina (epithelial cells).
</p>
<p>
The scent of the fluids and discharge in general have a colon scent still but the scent as the months go by decrease it was quite unpleasant a few weeks after surgery if i look back now is more tolerable.  The discharge im getting is translucent with a orange/brownish color to it. I confirmed with other girls that all this is normal and the discharge will get clear as i continue to heal and the odor goes away. Apart from the fluid scent my vulva smells normal ( yes iv been up close to a cis vulva and vagina in a non sexual way so i can compare ).
</p>
<p>
I also had swelling of the erectile tissue near the urethra but it goes down slowly still has a long way to go. The bulbus tissue in pic. It was tiny right after surgery but it swelled up as part of healing now is smaller than it was a month ago and can take a full year to settle i was told. The skin at the vaginal entrance will under go metaplasia after sometime , i saw a girl&#39;s result at 6 months and it looks smoother and more like a mucus membrane less like skin. My aftercare team (Siam Transformative) is awesome too i ask them any questions i have and they answer most of the times right away.

I saw on their website that their srs surgery gives a g-spot.  I&#39;ve never heard of anyone else mentioning this.   Are they the only ones doing that?

Our g spot is basically the prostate which is homologous to the g spot on people born with vaginas With hrt it shrinks down to a pea size and i think its function changes  What they do usually with srs is reroute the urethra ontop of the vaginal canal around the urethra is the g spot and when one heals and has any sexual stimulation the g spot can be located on the top wall of the vagina just like  on people born with vaginas.

Akello no most competent srs doctors that give anatomically correct results do that too basically if you have srs and your urethra is ontop of your vaginal opening then your g spot is located at the same spot as someone born with a vagina

They might mean that a part of the glans is spread below the neoclit. Basically often the glans is reduced in volume and some surgeons may discard it, some may preserve it. To my knowledge Suporn placed it below a neoclit and called it Chonburi organ. It may be possible to discuss it during a consultation.

Basically in the area between neoclit and urethra.  And it may not be that much different. It is possible to look up photo results. It may look a bit like a different colored tissue on top.

Ahh the cis gspot is in the vagina 1-3 inches within.  Swells up when aroused, feels like a spongy lump.  What you discrbe would be way different lol

People usually may have a G/Pspot. The prostate usually is left in place because it may make for issues with urination if it is removed. It may make for a pleasurable G/Pspot, similar to the Gspot in cis people, and it is made of similar tissue. It may be a few inches in, towards the belly, and it may be necessary to be engorged to feel pleasurable so enough foreplay may be necessary.
</p>
<p>
The other spot basically may be an additional sensate area.

I have a question. Do you have to dilate for the rest of your life with the colon SRS? Also if you do, how often must you dilate after a year?

Not really especially if you are sexually active and have penetrative sex.
</p>
<p>
Now i dilate once a day for 40 mins i was told to dilate twice a day but iv been doing it for once a day and its sufficient.

What made you go with the colon method? Asking because I&#39;m considering , but so many different reports, and some scare me! Tell me how is your BM? I have perfect digestion now, so scared to mess with it..

My bowel movement is not affected at all. You have to be very careful about what you eat i would say during the first month and the second one. During my stay in Thailand my aftercare team was in charge of my diet so i didnt have to worry much about finding the right foods to eat as my nurse came twice a day to bring me food water fruits and dilate me. Now i basically eat what ever i want.
</p>
<p>
I went with colon because the tissue is the same as vaginal or tissue from inside our mouths basically made of epithelial cells. Its very elastic and is also mascular just like a normal vagina. I read about it a lot too and people just like to talk without having first hand experience the girls i talked to are satisfied after fully being healed.

Sorry this is such a late comment, but in your opinion is colon better than PIV? And if so is it safe cause it looked like a good option to me for a more cis-like result but I read it is very risky so that scares me.

That’s an amazing surgery result. Congratulations! Thank you for posting. I’ve definitely learned a lot from this post (mostly dispelling myths about intestinal vaginoplasty that I had heard elsewhere).

Thank you. Im glad i was able to dispell those myths around colon vaginoplasty people make it out to be the worst out of all the techniques but in my honest opinion i think the worst is penile inversion or scrotal graft due to the fact that skin cant self clean and a lot of girls report dryness and lack of elasticity since the vagina is made of skin. That is just my opinion tho for some that might be the best technique.
