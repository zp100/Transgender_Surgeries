Hey everyone. I&#39;m a 24 years old trans girl from Paris. I just got a glottoplasty with Dr. Wagner at Tenon hospital in Paris. I previously had a cricothyroid approximation with the same surgeon back in December 2019 but it didn&#39;t work at all. I&#39;m glad I got rid of my Adam&#39;s apple in the process tho. So my question is : I got my op 2 days ago, on the 8th of March. I&#39;m 2 days into recovery today but I have some concerns and unanswered questions. I don&#39;t feel the stitches in my throat anymore. I don&#39;t feel any throat pain and discomfort, except for the phlegm and the no talking/no coughing part. But I&#39;m really worried about the not feeling the stitches in my throat part, only 2 days into recovery. Is it normal? Also, I have done a lot of research and consulted a lot of ressources about glottoplasty, and no one mentioned that you shouldn&#39;t yawn as I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s something that could really compromise my results. Does anyone know? Thanks for your help and attention. Would love to hear from someone who&#39;s gotten a glottoplasty before.

I just felt like I had a sore throat for a few days. I&#39;m not sure I could ever feel the stitches.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to do the best you can. You might reflex cough once or twice in your period of silence but as long as you manage it carefully you should be okay.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know about yawning.
</p>
<p>
If you feel a lot of phlegm try and breathe it out with deep breaths or put honey in your drink to try and break it up.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s impossible to know if everything has worked until you can speak again.
