Hey girl, I&#39;m 6 months post from Mt Sinai and had a bleed out scare from a dehicense (twice). So I feel what your going through. The depression after that situation is real too, because you start to go &#34;did I screw up&#34; while being in pain, then dealing with the dilation discomfort and not being able to take care of yourself or leave your room. Like it sucks jt really does and it takes a lot of mental fortitude to get through it all. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard all this before but my best advice, talk to people if you can. Video chat loved ones and friends who aren&#39;t there. If you have a therapist do video counseling. Play video games it you packed some (I played sooo much destiny), and just try and sleep as much as you can to make the time go faster.  I wish I could be more helpful to you, but I wish you all the best in your recovery and hope things get better from here.

I had one or two more issues after, but by about month 3 things were calming down. Now life is normal and things are fine besides some granulation tissue still and following the 3x a day dilation schedule. That gets old. But overall I&#39;m happy with my results and that life is just back to normal at this point. Like I went back to work at the end of month 3. Back to the gym and stuff then as well and just like things never even happened. But if you ever want to hear from someone who had her fair share of issues too feel free to ask away and I&#39;ll help however I can.

Hey girl, three months post op SRS from Dr. Pang at Mt. Sinai here and totally empathize with you. I had acute bleeding in my vaginal canal two weeks post-op and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance bleeding profusely. I did not need a blood transfusion but I was woozy by the time I left the hospital. No further complications thereafter.

Thanks for your condolences! Iâ€™m doing great absent a little granulation tissue in my canal which Iâ€™m applying steroid cream to. My aesthetic results are amazing and my sensation is ... well, letâ€™s just say clitoral stimulation feels really good ðŸ˜‰

Iâ€™m a little over 3 weeks postop at Sinai. I didnâ€™t have any bleeding complications, but I had a posterior fourchette dehiscence extending along the labial incisions inside the labia (not along the thigh crease). The depression is very real and youâ€™re definitely not the only one to feel it. My only advice is to keep up your nutrition. That seems like itâ€™s the only way to heal faster. Good luck!
