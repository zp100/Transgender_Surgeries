<strong>
Update (12/19/22):
</strong>
I had my appointment with Dr. DeLeon, and it went very well! It turns out that a lot of the redness, bleeding, and probably a good amount of pain was because of hyper-granulation tissue both on the outside and a lot on the inside. It would have been good if the nurses had told me about that so that I could have gotten it taken care of, but Dr. DeLeon pointed it out and did a silver nitrate treatment; hopefully that helps a lot. With regards to the labia majora separation, she offered a revision and said it should be pretty easy to reattach, and said insurance will pretty certainly cover it. We&#39;re planning on doing that in the summer (which was the best time for me), since by then the skin will be elastic enough to do it. It sucks that I&#39;m going to have to get a revision, but she told me that when she does it I can tell her if there&#39;s other smaller asymmetries I&#39;d like her to correct, and that it&#39;ll be outpatient, with healing only taking about a week.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Edit:
</strong>
I wanted to add as a disclaimer that my post shouldn&#39;t be indicative of Dr. DeLeon&#39;s results, and you should look to other posts for those. Vaginoplasty has risks, and I had a complication that I think was likely just me being unlucky rather than the fault of the surgeon. Whether or not I would recommend Dr. DeLeon will depend a lot on how my upcoming 5 month post-op meeting goes, whether I&#39;m offered a revision, and if so, how that turns out.
</p>
<p>
So, at the beginning of August, I got bottom surgery (full depth, penile inversion) with Dr. Ashley DeLeon with the Crane Center in Austin, TX. Around a week and a half in, I got wound dehiscence/separation; I was told at my post-ops that this is pretty common, looks horrible at first, and would re-connect and heal up (which to my understanding seems to be the consensus here as well), but at this point, it doesn&#39;t seem to have been the case for me. You can see at the bottom that my perineum just doesn&#39;t connect to my two labia majora - the left one only reaches around 3/4 of the way down, and the right only halfway down, with exposed wound still between that and the labia minora that hasn&#39;t improved. The bottom of the left labia one has gone through a few cycles of tearing from the outside of it, being very painful for a few days, before healing back up again.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s difficult to tell if this is the surgeon&#39;s fault, or if I was just unlucky. I appreciated the 3 post-op visits (though they were all within the first few weeks, when I think that it still seemed like it would heal up), but the nurses since then have been entirely unhelpful. Half my questions have just been left completely unanswered, and I&#39;ve gotten a number of responses along the lines of &#34;You have great results!&#34; and &#34;It will take a year before you will see final results.&#34; I have another in-person appointment with Dr. DeLeon in December, so we&#39;ll see how that goes; I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll have something different to say, and that I can get a revision planned for the summer. With how much of my labia I&#39;ve lost, I&#39;m not really sure how that can be replaced.
</p>
<p>
The hospital stay was alright, I think I was at Westlake, but forgot. I wasn&#39;t in there very long, and have insensitivity to pain meds, which did cause a lot of problems with trying to get more while I was recovering.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still a bit uncertain about my clitoris, clitoral hood and where they are - it seems to be the small notch a centimeter down from the top? I don&#39;t really know if it is supposed to be like this, and would appreciate a little clarification if anyone could provide me that (the nurse just sent me an image with a circle around the top third of the area. I figure it can&#39;t be as bad as the labia, but it would be good to know for when discussing future revisions.
</p>
<p>
On the bright side, I have great depth and haven&#39;t had major problems with dilating beyond pain I can work through. I&#39;m able to get to 5 dots on the purple dilator (so 6 inches of depth, I guess 5 inches if you&#39;re talking about the bottom of the vagina instead of the top), and have worked my way up to the green dilator, a bit over 3 dots along. It was painful to stretch the ring of scar tissue visible at the bottom, but possible without anything like silver nitrate. I figure that penetration will be possible. My nerves seem fine, and I&#39;ve been able to orgasm a few times as well, involving both anal and clitoral stimulation. With the exposed and disconnected parts of the labia stimulation, however, manual stimulation can cause a bit of tearing if it&#39;s not careful.

I had the same thing happen. I had a revision by my doctor who is awesome! I now feel like I have a normal vagina. I think after a revision by a qualified doctor you‚Äôll be happy üòä

Yeah, question is how to find one :( I&#39;ll see what Dr. DeLeon says in December and if she offers one next summer, since that would be easiest, but I&#39;m a bit hesitant about getting surgery with her again since I still don&#39;t know if this was me being unlucky or error on her part. Crane Center Austin would be easiest since I reside there, but perhaps I might be able to get in with Dr. Crane instead; I don&#39;t know how possible it would be to get one in June at this point, but I would like to do it then since I&#39;m planning on going to grad school in the fall.
</p>
<p>
Glad to hear someone else had the same problem! When I looked at posts here, it looked like most everyone who mentioned wound separation had it heal, and even those with the worst wound separation at the start looked great in comparison.

Sometimes we‚Äôre just unlucky people. I was one of the unlucky ones I spent a week ICU and I had all complications with my vagina. But it wasn‚Äôt my doctors fault. It was just my body.

Geez, yeah, that sucks. Dunno what this was, I think the stitches just kinda fell out too early. I&#39;ve had bad fatigue and brain fog since surgery (iron infusion didn&#39;t even help), but it&#39;s difficult to tell if that was actually caused by surgery or if that just made previous fatigue I had worse. In a lot of ways, think I was lucky that the only complication I had was this; things could have been a lot worse.

Goes without saying, I‚Äôm so sorry this happened. Although i was wondering, how was your experience/opinion of DeLeon? Do you personally feel what happened is just, bad luck- or on the surgeon? I had a consult with her last summer, but I haven‚Äôt decided on anyone yet. Just looking around for more opinions.

I think a lot of that depends on how our meeting in December goes and whether she offers a free revision or not. I did appreciate that DeLeon does weekly post-op meetings for the first 3 weeks after surgery, I&#39;ve heard supposedly not all do that. Have not been happy with the Crane Center nurses, on the other hand. Personally, I think that it was probably just bad luck; while I&#39;ve seen some mixed results from DeLeon on this sub, I think this is less poor aesthetics on her part and more just that I got really bad wound separation that didn&#39;t heal. I don&#39;t know that for sure though, maybe she messed up somehow in a way that caused this.

goodness‚Ä¶..sorry this happened. Im convinced the only worthwhile surgeon in crane center is sf location. Greenbrae with dr min jun. Im not getting this at all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶like why does your openimg look like that and have a break in labia minora to start new one near your anus??

The labias connected at the perineum to begin with, but the stitches fell out too soon and it ended up tearing.

That part of the labia is very sensitive and prone to tear. I‚Äôve had 2 revisions personally and I still need one more to fix a little tear that was my fault. This time I will be on complete bed rest for a week.

After the first couple days and I was out of the hospital, I was told I needed to walk for 15 minutes three times a day. I&#39;m wondering if that might have been bad advice.
