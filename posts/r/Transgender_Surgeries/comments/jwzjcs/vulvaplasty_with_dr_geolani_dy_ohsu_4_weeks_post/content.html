Vulvaplasty is also known as “zero depth vaginoplasty”, no vagina is created only vulva.
</p>
<p>
The colors are slightly off as I lacked the energy to tune to RAW file in lightroom properly and relied on the somewhat crappy automatic white balance in the A7iii, hence why some parts look a little more purple than they should.
</p>
<p>
Posted not as an example of “final product” but an example of the healing process.  Everything is still EXTREMELY swollen, based on my experience with my partners surgery and also the word of the surgeon.
</p>
<p>
The dehiscence in the previous photo I posted had been replaced by fresh pink skin.  It did go through a phase of producing yellowy exudate (commonly mistaken for pus but is actually a harmless common part of wound healing).
</p>
<p>
Questions welcome.

Looks amazing, especially for being so recent. How&#39;s the healing going? Are you able to get around, go about normal life?

Probably a dumb question but if one chooses this option, can depth be added later?

Ah ok, i am new to being trans just found out i was a few months ago. Was wondering why some one would opt for this type of surgery if its not functional?

Some people know that they have no desire for penetration. I’d suppose that some people might be daunted by the prospect of a lifetime of dilation and opt for it that way. There can also be underlying medical issues that rule out vaginoplasty. And, finally, the vulvaplasty/zero-depth method, if I understand correctly, has a much faster recovery time.

Ah ok those answers all make sense, though i thought the dilation was only for the first year or two? Do people really have to dilate the rest of their lives?

The recommended frequency does taper down quite a bit, but dilation needs to continue to prevent loss of depth.

not everyone desires penetrative intercourse. There is still a functional clit and for many orgasm can be achieved clitorally. As others have said the recovery of full depth vaginoplasty is extremely intense ( in part because they cut the pelvic floor - this requires *a lot* of healing ), you have to dilate for the rest of your life and there is greater risk of complications.

I resent it being called “non functional” its perfectly functional, just perhaps not in the one dimension you seem to have reduced it to. Vaginas are not just defined by their ability to be penetrated.
</p>
<p>
I chose it because dilation would have been too difficult for me to do

Sorry it was not my intent to offend i worded it poorly without thinking. This is also very amazing results, once you recover from the surgery it would be hard to tell you were not born with it.

Most commonly stated reasons for getting zero depth are recovery time and/or complications or the person doesn’t want/need penetrative intercourse. Ask, the dilating schedule can be pretty intensive at first and is a must to keep depth.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I find zero depth pretty attractive but I’m not 100%.
</p>
<p>
Someone else can correct me if I’ve misstated.

What the others said, recovery took me about 6mo and dilation stole a year of my life and I&#39;m still having problems, so yeah, zero depth has its perks, but tbh, after being railed the first time, I was glad I didn&#39;t opt for zero depth.

Im scheduled for vulvaplasty with Dr Dy next year sometime.  Personally, my reasons are:
</p>
<p>
“Functional” doesn’t equate to “Able to be penetrated.”  As long as I can orgasm and have sensation, I’m happy.  Doesn’t hurt that I’m lesbian so penetration isn’t the end all be all anyway.
</p>
<p>
I also just can’t deal with the year of electrolysis down there that full vaginoplasty requires.  Between the dysphoria and physical pain, that sounds like some Hellraiser cenobite shit to me.  Plus, electrolysis has proven less effective than I’d like on my facial hair so I’m skeptical it would fair much better down there anyway.  Similarly, while I do have some desire for penetration the idea of dilation kinda freaks me out(it’d be different if I could just snap my fingers and give myself a vag magically).
</p>
<p>
Sex also isn’t everything my dysphoria down there is about.  Having to look at it in the bath makes me want to puke.  I feel like I’m always having to hide a secret, even after my orchi, and avoided gyms for years even pre-COVID due to it.  I dress specifically around ensuring there’s no way a bad tuck could be visible.  Getting rid of my current genitalia would do more for me than being able to be penetrated ever could.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there’s the practical side: the only person who can do genital electro and accepts my insurance in my area has a year long waitlist, and even if they didn’t the wait time after my in-person consult is significantly longer for vaginoplasty.  I waited 4 years to get an in-person consult, and have made sacrifices to stay on my OHP insurance since it’s the only way I’ll get SRS.  I’m ready to move on already.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
TL;DR
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Given most of my dysphoria is centered around everyday life stuff and not so much sex(though, sure, that’s definitely there), and that vulvlaplasty is more accessible, and that penetration is just a very low-importance goal for me, a small compromise to ensure I get what I need is totally worth it.

Yes but its more difficult as some material is tossed that would be super useful for it otherwise, also the scar tissue buildup makes the surgery harder.  No surgeon would advise it as a deliberate choice. It is doable though if you regret it and really want depth

About a year. I was originally in the queue for Dr Dugi but was contacted early and asked if i wanted to go with Dr Dy. Not sure about the current state of the queue, i imagine it could be shorter but may be complicated by COVID
