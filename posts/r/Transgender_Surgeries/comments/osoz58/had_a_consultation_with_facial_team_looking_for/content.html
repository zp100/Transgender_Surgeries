Last week I had a consultation with them and their prices are just crazy for me. I wasn&#39;t sure what exactly do I need in terms of FFS, I was considering rhinoplasty, forehead reduction and jaw surgery. Surgeon told me that he don&#39;t think that I need all of that and forehead reduction would be great alone and maybe rhinoplasty if I really want that. So at first I was happy with the results of the consultation and thought that the price would not be very high, because I don&#39;t need a lot of surgeries. And when I got the price tag, I was just blown away. 19,000 for the brow and 32,000 for all three procedures.  That&#39;s just a cosmically huge amount of money. I thought it would be half that.On top of that, I really doubt that just one forehead reduction will really be enough for me. I really hate my face. Maybe you could advise me on cheaper but still safe options. I&#39;m very concerned about safety because I&#39;ve been the victim of medical errors many times before and I don&#39;t want it to happen again.

Actually Facial Team has very reasonable prices. Some people go to them because they are cheaper than other top tier surgeons around the world. For example, prices from US surgeons such as Dr Deschamps-Braly and Dr Harrison Lee are nearly double the typical prices from Facial Team. Surgeries are just super expensive overall. It sucks, I know.
</p>
<p>
For surgeons that have a lot of experience in FFS but are less expensive, consider Dr Rossi in Argentina. Or Dr Cardenas in Mexico. The FFS surgeons in Thailand also have low prices, but they typically do not do type 3 forehead reconstructions.

Whatever you decide please DO NOT go to butcher Bart Van de Ven and get conned by his cheaper prices. FT is expensive but consistent in results. No botched beyond repair cases so far or lawsuits or dead patients. Butcher Bart has it all, even a video of him calling his victim crazy. That&#39;s how he sees us - crazy.

Too subtle?
</p>
<p>
Nah. Just very natural.
</p>
<p>
If you go to FT, you won&#39;t end up looking like somebody who&#39;s had obvious plastic surgery.  FT are extremely good at what they do.  There are surgeons who&#39;ll plump your lips to tasteless &#34;TikTok&#34; levels if you want that, or raise your brows to extreme levels of surprise, but do you want that? Like really? In five, ten, twenty years, do you want to be looking like something from 2021?

Good FFS is feminization, not beautification. Femininity is timeless. Beauty is definitely of its time.

“Good FFS is feminization, not beautification” YES!! This is actually one of the reasons I’m putting off FFS myself, I want to wait until I’m a bit older and more able to separate my insecurities from my gender dysphoria.

I keep hearing this being repeated the fact they&#39;re too subtle, can you not just tell them you want a more drastic change, surely they will Accommodate, they have been my #1 choice for a while but I&#39;d be so mad if I spent 60k AUD aka like 45k USD and still felt like a had an unpassable face.

So far it&#39;s either Bryan Rolfes or still the facial team, I&#39;m still fresh to HRT I wanna wait the recommended 3 years to know if I need any fat transfers(probably longer) I want SRS first to get off Tblockers asap
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really just gathering info atm I&#39;m praying my surgical transition comes in @ 100k AUD or under

In my experience the surgeon I spoke to was pretty inflexible and basically told me if I didn&#39;t like the simulated result I should go elsewhere.

I feel sorry for you. How much does this injury bother you? I was considering them specifically because I have a lot of health problems that I&#39;ve had because of doctors&#39; mistakes (improper hormone therapy, bad nose surgery (not plastic surgery), misdiagnosis). But if I am disappointed with their results and they hurt me in the process, I would probably extremely depressed, I don&#39;t even know how I could have handled such a shock, especially considering the insane amount of money they want for their work. I&#39;m Ukrainian and in Ukraine you can buy a new apartment or even a small house for this money.

I hate to say this but im a cheap azz but in this case I think the old saying goes. You get what you pay for, cheap not always the best option (I know sometimes it’s the only one but) Hugs

Also remember, this is your face, most other results can be kept private but your face is what everyone (including you) will see. If you go cheap and pick a surgeon without demonstrable experience you may end up in a really bad situation requiring follow up surgeries to correct mistakes that cannot be hidden under clothes.

I&#39;m beginning to think that maybe I should give up on this idea. If I throw away so much money and I&#39;m not satisfied with the result, I&#39;ll regret it for the rest of my life, and I&#39;ll feel the same way if the doctors make mistakes. So it sounds too much like a gambling to me. Also I am from a poor country and if I for example donated this amount of money to an animal shelter in my country, this amount would be enough for several years. So I don&#39;t think I deserve something like that.

Yeah the cost of this kind of thing is pretty insane. In an ideal world you wouldn&#39;t have to pay out of pocket for a procedure like this. But please don&#39;t undercut your own value like that. You deserve happiness and to be healthy physically and mentally. The problem here isn&#39;t you, it&#39;s the messed up priorities of this world we live in that values money more than health and happiness.

I went through FT cost all I had at the time. I’m extremely satisfied with the results. Your face is the most important part to feminize imho. This is what people use to evaluate your gender.

I have my doubts that even after such an operation, I will still not be happy with the result, but even if so, I still do not have that kind of money and will not for a long long time, so I need to try to forget about it otherwise I can drive myself crazy constantly thinking about that. All the time after counseling with them I feel very depressed, I can&#39;t sleep properly and it affects not only me but also my boyfriend.
