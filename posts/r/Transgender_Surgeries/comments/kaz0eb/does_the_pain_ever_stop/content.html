I think it&#39;s 38 days now post op vaginoplasty with PPT. I&#39;m still in pain every day all day. I&#39;m taking Percocet Rx, 2700mg Gabapentin, ibuprofen, Tylenol, arnica, icing constantly, and the pain is never gone.
</p>
<p>
I get break through pain, insane nerve pain that makes me question my life, pain on moving, pain on trying to sit, pain going to the bathroom, pain showering, pain dilating, pain while douching, and pain laying down trying to get to sleep.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not like I&#39;m in agony. But it&#39;s just enough pain to never be comfortable. I always had a much higher than average pain threshold. But this, this is breaking me.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to do.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had swelling and wound separation and that&#39;s making things tough, but I just thought that by now I would be doing better. It&#39;s gotten me so down and depressed.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to do.
</p>
<p>
Edit: thank you for the comments. I appreciate it. I would respond to each of you but I&#39;m just too depressed and at my mind&#39;s end to be able to manage that right now.

First of all, I am sorry you have had such a rough experience. But secondly, I can tell you I had a similar experience, but maybe not quite as pervasive.
</p>
<p>
I was in pain for weeks,  and couldn&#39;t sit down without a donut cushion.  As you say, it was never agony, but relentless discomfort.  At my six-week follow-up visit my surgeon (Dr. McGinn) found a separated incision, which she packed with iodoform gauze.  That (eventually) helped quite a bit , but it was always tender down there, and any kind of penetration was unpleasant. It was a good five months before I felt &#34;normal&#34;.
</p>
<p>
I found that for dilation, use of EMLA cream is quite helpful, as well as for controlling post-dilation pain. It&#39;s a temporary fix and doesn&#39;t address the underlying problem, but it might give you a couple of hours of respite.
</p>
<p>
However, your experience seems more serious, and is beyond acceptable.  If you haven&#39;t already done so I would contact your surgeon immediately. That kind of pain could be an infection and you don&#39;t want to lapse into sepsis. That can be fatal.
</p>

I know it is frustrating but is your pain reducing, even slightly? Have you talked to your surgeon about it?

2700 mg Gabapentin?  Owo  That&#39;s three times the maximum that&#39;s recommended.  In fact, that&#39;s usually a psychedelic trip level dose.  I&#39;m surprised you have pain breaking through that.  I feel terrible for you because, honestly, that&#39;s pretty bad if a dose that high isn&#39;t doing the job.  :(

Gabapentin-I’m not a big fan of.  It caused my eyes to itch and swell.
</p>
<p>
An older trans in my support group told me srs has two groups.  One has little to no post op pain cs. Those who experience a lot of paim and have miserable recoveries.  One of my friends who got done by Schrang (he’s been dead for some time nowbut was popular in the 1990s.)before I knew her said it didn’t hurt at all: just discomfort. I was like what😱😱🤢. Hope you are feeling better soon and do follow the advice to get checked out, even if just by PCP.

In practicing pain management with hospice patients, I’ve received patients on 4800mg of gabapentin a day although the typical dose is
<a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/jeffrey-fudin/2017/12/appropriate-gabapentin-dosing-for-neuropathic-pain" rel="nofollow">1800-3600 mg a day divided into 3 doses</a>
, so the current dose is pretty average. I also prescribe medical marijuana and patients who come off of gabapentin often remark that they didn’t realize how ‘cloudy’ their thinking was until they stopped it.
</p>
<p>
FWIW in my opinion the most effective medicine for nerve pain is low dose methadone (2.5-5 mg) 3 or 4 times a day, depending on liver function.

Thank you for that!  I think I must have been looking at the dose for anxiety.  I&#39;m on 100 mg twice a day for anxiety so 2700 mg seems like a monster dose!  But if it&#39;s normal, hey, that&#39;s ok.  :)

I&#39;m so sorry your pain is that bad, it does sound abnormal and I would seek medical advice. I&#39;m 32 days and I take 50 mg Tramadola bout 3x a day. I&#39;m trying to wean myself off but I still have pain obviously.

Partner of someone who had surgery 9 months ago--I just checked in with her to see if she was comfortable with me giving some information about her experience and she said yes.
</p>
<p>
So yes, the pain does stop eventually, but for some it does take longer. She was on Percocet for 3, maybe 4 months (side note, I was on Gabapentin for nerve pain a while back and it does have a side effect of memory loss, so try to keep an eye on that if you&#39;re able to). She also had a lot of issues with wound separation and swelling. But it does get better, and she has very little pain at this point. Everyone says that the first 3 months are the hardest and she didn&#39;t believe it at first, but that was definitely her experience.
</p>
<p>
Do you by any chance have EDS or any other type of autoimmune issues/slow healing/etc? That can also make healing slower and pain more long-lasting
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best! If you&#39;re able to be in touch with your surgeon I&#39;m sure that will be useful as well

Hey, just want to remind you that nothing is permanent. Pain will go away. I know it feels like is not but that&#39;s because of the number of days you have had to endure it. Psychologically is tiring which adds to the amplification of the situation. You&#39;re not alone in this. I do want to tell you though that even even though everyone heals differently I will highly recommend you talking to a medical professional. Resting is required in order to heal and if you&#39;re not comfortable then they should make sure to find a way to make you feel better. Don&#39;t hesitate to let them know in detail how you&#39;re feeling physically and emotionally.  It is part of their responsibility to make sure you are relaxed enough to heal properly. Much love, peace, and healing to you &lt;3

Hi,
</p>
<p>
Everyone&#39;s pain levels are different. I was uncomfortable for a week after surgery. I was getting lots of paracetamol. I also had one or two really low doses of oxy at night to sleep. I should also say that I have nerve pain from an accident all the time, so perhaps I have an unusual tolerance. That said, by 38 days, I was going for at least one walk a day of about 500 metres. I needed ice afterwards, but I was fine. Dialating never hurt after the first week. I struggled to sit for long periods  untill after six weeks. I would certainly talk to your doctor. I wouldn&#39;t worry, as it will get better, but I think you should check.
</p>
<p>
Good luck.
</p>

I had similar issues for about eight weeks after a perineal urethrostomy surgery. It was miserable and I thought it would never subside. By week 12, things were way better... Hang in there.

Just over 6 weeks here, I have some pain, but Motrin is all I have to deal with it.  I have some swelling as well.  I spend most days laid out on the couch to limit pain.

Eight weeks for me too, I had a bit of granulation that need to be sorted with silver nitrate. As mentioned in a previous post I was also given Tramadol for pain relief here in the UK. It worked wonders for the pain and made it non existent,  the constipation it caused!!!!! Now that&#39;s another story lol.😂 Good luck with your recovery. 😍 Hugs Scarlett x

When ill get surgery im planning to use BPC-157 peptide wich is basicly a peptide that gives the body a major boost in healing itself. It&#39;s not for everyone but if you look into it, it might be something for you. Hoping you recover fast.  Stay strong, it&#39;ll get better.  Hugs🤗🌹

I was the same up until about 40 days in when pain began to slowly subside. Now I can manage with only paracetamol.

i don&#39;t mean to seem rude but I really don&#39;t think this is helpful unless you&#39;re a doctor who personally examined OP. the level of pain she is describing may not actually be normal, we have no clue. love your positivity but this could potentially be dangerous advice.

It&#39;s a tough and invasive surgery babe, I felt the same way with mine. I&#39;ve always had an amazingly high tolerance but this put me to a test I never experience. It fades, it gets easier I promise. Things perk up. take the time to stay off your feet as much as you are able.  Good luck with everything in your recovery.
