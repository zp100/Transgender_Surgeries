Good morning. I had my vaginoplasty on Tuesday early and it is early Saturday. This started back the end of Feb. when I called about a  video consult.  I had one anout 2 weeks later. We talked about my goals my history how long on hormones and living full time etc.  There had been a cancelation so early May was available instead of late summer to ealy fall. I had one letter from my therapist I see for trauma and gender issues already.  It was easy to get a second letter through galap.org  I prepaid things, getting insurance reimbursement on the back end.  ( I am lucky here ). The week prior I was a bundle of nerves.  I showed up and went to sleep with a penis and woke up with a vagina.  The nurse in pacu had trouble with my pain initially, thenit was taken care of.  After that my pain has been good especially when I stay on my back.  I do get up and walk and sit.  This is fine , but does increase swelling so I try to do enough, but  not too much.
<br>
I have a catheter and vag pack in place.  I peeked yesterday omg my vagina( vulva technically) as I cant see the canal.  My vagina and whole groin area onto one flank is bruised and swollen.  Using some ice.  Will try showering today. Using pads and change every 2 to3 hrz sometimes longer.  I have to empty my cath.  Monday I go for catheter and packing removal,changing arrangements so I will flyhome Tuesday instead.  I have cried when I really think of how happy I am.  I just need to keep taking care of myself and stay in communication with my surgeon.  A good friend is here with me.

It swells less if you take it easy.  I have laid down from mostly fatigue and being very tired. The pain right now is very little.I have taken no opioids the last couple of days, onlyaleve and tylenol.
