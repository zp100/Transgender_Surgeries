Would anyone else be willing to share their dilation routine as prescribed by their doc?

I&#39;m asking because my surgeons routine sounds hellish and I&#39;m curious if it&#39;s par for the course. I&#39;ll be seeing Dr. Brassard (eventually) and a friend who went to him showed me the routine he gives to patients and told me what it was like. Upon coming home from the hospital patients are required to dilate 4 times a day which included icing for 40 minutes, dilating for 30 minutes, and icing again for 20 minutes, and then having a bath. I was with her for one of her dilations (at her apartment, not in the room with her) and it seemed awful, seeing her come out so defeated and tired. The mental strain it had on her was a lot and it really scared me.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, just curious what your routine was like and if the one I just mentioned was regular or a bit much. Any insight would be greatly appreciated : )

Dr. Krakowsky:
</p>
<p>
3x a day for 15 minutes at depth with the largest dilator you&#39;re using for the first 3 months. 2x a day for the next 6 months 1x a day until 18 months 1x a week afterwards
</p>
<p>
As tolerated, if you notice increasing difficulty or loss of depth, dilate more often.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t douch unless necessary.

That seems to be what others are saying, douche/clean up once a day. Thank you so much for your insight!

I had surgery with Mr Fenton in Leeds. No dilation until 6 weeks after surgery and then 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening. After 6 months I cut down to 1 dilation a day.

That is insane!! Was it just a normal inversion method srs? Iâ€™ve never ever heard of someone having such a laid back recovery (from a dilation standpoint that is)

Yep inversion method, although using a scrotal flap to add extra depth. I think he said it was something to do with the way he dissected through the pelvic floor muscle which is not standard, and meant that dilation could be delayed without any loss of depth or width. I know other women who had surgery with him who didn&#39;t start dilating until after 8 weeks. Shame he&#39;s retired now

Mount Sinai: 20 - 30 minutes 2 - 3 a day then considerably less after 6 months. Haven&#39;t gotten to the year mark yet so I dunno if it gets to be less often.
</p>
<p>
Holy cow does it seem like your friend&#39;s routine is laborious! Good lord! I was never never told to ice or do anything other than the regular boring old dilation.

Same here, My best recollection is that I was sent home with a secondary packing (they called it a bolster), then I went back around 4-5 days for that to be removed. Then I was not to dilate immediately, but to douche once a day, to get debris skin to flush out. That lasted 3-5 days (?), then I was to dilate 3x day with only the SS GRS #1 dilator. I think there was some concern that ramping up the sizes immediately, while swelling was still going down, could abuse some sutures. Then I was told to gently try to dilate with SS #2, but use my own judgement on when, and how deep, without forcing things. About here, I was having issues getting the SS #1 to go in as deep as they wanted (3rd dot), and someone showed me a YT video of a recent postop dilating. She was using SS petite #2 with SS regular #1, so I ordered the petite set. The SS petite #2 did allow me to get the lube in where it needed to be, and then the SS regular #1 was used without any issue. Over the next couple of weeks, I slowly ramped up to SS #2, and SS #3. My best remembrance is that it was probably 4 months out before I tried SS #4 (the largest dilator) and was able to get it in to 2nd dot, and eventually to 3rd dot.
</p>
<p>
Somewhere around 3 months out, I dropped back to twice a day, with douche after each session. When I was released (at 7.5 months) I dropped back to once a day. Dilation from that point is at my own judgement, no instructions. A few weeks back (+15 months) I am now dilating 2 out of every 3 days. I&#39;ll keep that up for a few months, then fade a little more to every other day. Probably since 5-6 months post op, depth has been rock solid stable, the SS petite #2 or the regular #1 go down to the
<em>
hard bottom
</em>
, while the larger dilators go slightly less due to dilator girth and tapering.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning I douched with a basic vinegar douche. About the time I was released, I switched to a purified water douche. Both brands of lube I use contain methycellulose. I have briefly tried another brand, that did not have that, and quickly reverted to the original two. IMHO, sufficient lube is very important, as is the ingredients in the lube.

That&#39;s the reaction I get from most people :/ it makes me wonder if I could do less than prescribed, results permitted. I know it&#39;s not wise to go against doctor recommendations but his routine just seems way over the top for your run of the mill srs, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s doing anything all that different than other surgeons.

It also may be that the surgeon is issuing directions based upon exactly how an individual came out of surgery. I cannot believe that this is so regularized that everyone needs exactly the same after care instructions.

For what it&#39;s worth I saw Brassard and was never told to ice for 40/20 minutes before/after dilation. In fact I was told not to ice for longer than 15 minutes at a time because you don&#39;t want to freeze anything down there lol. You just do it through the day as you need it for pain/swelling pretty much. My swelling reduced fairly quickly and I don&#39;t think I iced at all after like the first week home. The baths are quick and you only have to do them for the first 8 weeks, and not with every dilation. You&#39;ll want to be keeping that area clean anyways so it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
The dilation is a huge pain for the first month but honestly that first month goes by very fast. By three months out you&#39;re down to 2x a day and honestly it&#39;s no big deal, just lie down and watch some netflix and do the thing and then get on with your day. Just to offer some reassurance!

It sounds like my friend was being a bit too careful then. She 2 months out she honestly looked like all life had been sapped out of her and it really spooked me. Glad to hear that&#39;s not always the case and you had a tough start but smooth sailing otherwise! Thank you so much for sharing : )
