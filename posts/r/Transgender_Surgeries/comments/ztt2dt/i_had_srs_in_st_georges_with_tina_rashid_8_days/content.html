How are you feeling about how things went?

Weâ€™re you NHS? If so what did your timeline look like?

I&#39;m doing ok. More pain than I expected but since getting home, dilation is so much better than it was to begin with. Mostly I&#39;m just tired.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really happy with how things went. I got about 5.5&#34; depth, and the aesthetics already look good. I had a UTI in the hospital, and have some stitch separation, but other than those very minor things I have no complaints.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m Irish, so initially it was with out health system and then through the NHS. I was bounced around waiting lists for the last six or so years - but was referred to Tina Rashid in August 2020. After this, my referral was lost/forgotten about 3-4 times. I only found this out as I kept calling and emailing about my place on the waiting list so it could have taken less time than that.

Congratulations on your surgery from another TR patient. Dilation gets better, stick at it!!
</p>
<p>
+1 on the UTI. It delayed my discharge, but cleared up quickly.

I was lucky enough to be discharged on day 6. Nearly missed our flight due to a fuck up with the discharge papers but so glad to be far away from there

Yup, I got out day 6 as well just later rather than earlier! Thankfully I had booked a night at Heathrow ahead of a flight the day after for such eventualities!! IV antibiotics work fast!!
</p>
<p>
How are you doing now?

I&#39;m ok! Bouncing between no energy and a bunch. If I hit 2km then I&#39;m basically wiped out for the day which is frustrating. Dilating is uncomfortable but getting into a routine is making it a bit easier. I still have a lot of pain, but I think it might be down to dehiscence
