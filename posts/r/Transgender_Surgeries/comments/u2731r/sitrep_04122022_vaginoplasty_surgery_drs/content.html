When was that? I never heard of Dr Dy... I had Dr dugi this last August... OHSU&#39;s team is freaking STELLAR when it comes to trans-healthcare... let alone their overall service. I LOVE them there!!

I was there in August, and there was only one nurse that gave me an issue... she was &#34;new&#34; to the surgical recovery section, covering for covid shortages... and thought it &#34;better to see how I feel&#34; in an hour or two and refused my pain meds... I had already gotten myself off of patient controlled the day before... which they said was 2 days early... I was pissed when I ended up suffering for 5 hrs because of her... but I got it back under control, and she apologized profusely, after my wife and I laid into her, she promised she wouldn&#39;t do that to anybody else.

Patient controlled for me was dilaudid iv, with a button. I was tired of waking up every 10 minutes and feeling high from that shit... so I asked them to remove it... when I finally got my &#34;good&#34; nurse back, she gave me a little in my iv before my oxy&#39;s... that was a rough 4 hrs... but I hated the dilaudid, made me feel sick all day and night...
</p>
<p>
I was able to drop my oxygen dosage quickly, by the time I was let out after my 5 days, I was only on four 5&#39;s a day. A week later, only 2.
</p>
<p>
Dr dugi was surprised at how fast I healed... I was back to work after 4 weeks... &#34;light duty&#34; construction stuff (freelance of course)... patching, installing doors, and LVT flooring.... I&#39;m super happy with results.
</p>
<p>
You must live there to have so many friends going to OHSU for surgery, and being there for them... I live a few hours south...

Thank you‚ù£Ô∏è This was my very first dilation, under instruction. The nurse commented on my calmness and ease with performing the procedure and how easily the blue dilator was inserted.
</p>
<p>
This team has their patients dilate twice on Day 5, before discharge. After this photo was taken, we went into the shower for douche instruction. Then it was my turn to demonstrate that I could perform the whole process.
</p>
<p>
The nurse looked at me, and stated she thought I could use the green dilator. I didn‚Äôt even look, and I did the second one using the green.
</p>
<p>
My brand new daily schedule starts in the morning. I‚Äôm believing the green is a go!

Understood. Moving up to the green was done under supervision of the nurse. She is well versed in experience and was of the opinion that I could. She was right.
</p>
<p>
The dilation was ‚Äùtight‚Äù, not tearing. I was completely relaxed and comfortable.

THAT, is extremely unfortunate and definitely negatively affects the healing. I‚Äôm sorry to hear and hope she‚Äôs okay.
</p>
<p>
THIS girl is a ‚Äúrules and regulations‚Äù kinda girl. I go by what my surgery team tells me.
