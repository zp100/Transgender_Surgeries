I am at the point of of my journey that I am about to get referred for bottom surgery. My doctor has given me a list of Hospitals and Surgeons that she can refer me to and I am just wondering if any of you have had experience with any of the surgeons to help my choice be a bit easier.
</p>
<p>
The Surgeons (and hospitals) I can choose from are:
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Brighton Nuffield
</strong>
<br>
Charles Coker
<br>
Timothy Larner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Imperial Collage Healthcare - London
</strong>
<br>
Tina Rashid
<br>
Roland Morley
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Parkside Hospital - Wimbledon
</strong>
<br>
Tina Rashid
<br>
James Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
From what I have seen online right now I am thinking of either Timothy Larner or Tina Rashid.
<br>
Anything at all will help Thanks &lt;3

Do not, I repeat DO NOT go for Bellringer. he has a horrible bedside manner and has rushed surgeries recently.

Mine included.
</p>
<p>
Tina Rashid is a much nicer person and her sutures are far superior to the alternative.

I can’t believe Bellringer is still practicing. When I went for my SRS 10 years ago he was there on the NHS and had bad rep. Ultimately I decided the NHS surgeons couldn’t give me what I needed so I went to Thailand and paid for it myself. You only get one chance at this so do your homework and due diligence and good luck

I’m a little out of touch with the uk surgeons and their techniques, but the traditional penile inversion would have given me a very compromised result as I had very little donor material. Whereas the Thai technique was far superior for me and has given my much better results

Yeah. That&#39;s fair. I can&#39;t really afford to go abroad for surgery or even go private so I have to go with NHS and penile inversion.

To be honest I couldn’t really afford it either, but I got a loan and paid for it that way. Hopefully the NHS offerings have improved in the last 10 years

I&#39;m one month post op with Miss Rashid and glad I picked her. I had a few visits from Mr Bellringer which left me feeling glad I didn&#39;t choose him!
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer questions :)

what were those visits from Bellringer like?
</p>
<p>
Also how is everything so far? Any notable complications? Or is it too early to tell?

Everything is going mostly ok so far. I had a significant temperature pretty soon after discharge from hospital and then had some big issues dilating a few days later which needed a trip back to London. I was very pleased with the service from Ms Rashid and the team fitting me in at short notice and felt well looked after.
</p>
<p>
It was wound dehistence under the vagina entrance, which I was inadvertently dilating. Fortunately it was caught soon enough I didn&#39;t lose the vagina and didn&#39;t lose any depth. The dehistence is slow to heal though and pretty annoying but manageable. She prescribed me some serious antibiotics and the temperature was gone the next day.
</p>
<p>
Dilating is going fairly smoothly now and is often a nice time to just relax, although sometimes it&#39;s a little more painful towards the end it&#39;s not really much of a chore.
</p>
<p>
Apart from that it&#39;s looking pretty well healed, though there&#39;s still obvious swelling. The pain is pretty light in general and has been since I was discharged. Although sensation is a bit all over the place, it&#39;s felt totally natural the whole time and like it&#39;s always been there, which was a big surprise. My brain just went &#39;yeah this is cool&#39;. There&#39;s still a general feeling of tightness around the clitoris area which is the most annoying part right now.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I expected more pain and more post surgery fatigue, but most of what I&#39;m dealing with daily is just kinda annoying, rather than anything harder to cope with. I&#39;m also disabled and was worried about losing more daily function due to fatigue but I was pretty much back at my usual function after a week or two.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve sent you a PM if you&#39;d like more on my experience in hospital :)

I recently (7 weeks ago) had surgery with Miss Rashid at Parkside. I had a very good experience and would have no hesitation in recommending her. The surgery went well and both the nursing team and hospital were excellent.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to DM if you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
Good luck.
