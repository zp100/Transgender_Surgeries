I am trying to make a final decision on my SRS provider. I have researched and done consults in fits and starts over the past few years but found it maddeningly difficult to get reliable information - thank goodness for this sub being one of the only islands out there. I now feel that I&#39;ve been waiting for years to get SRS, but I also haven&#39;t been on any waitlists or made meaningful progress. I&#39;ve done about half of the electrolysis I&#39;d need for surgery in the US in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get into the lottery for Dr. Bank in January, and my intense disappointment has made it increasingly clear that I can&#39;t wait much longer. I did a consult with Dr. Chettawut this week, and it felt pretty good. It seems like I can get in with him this year, which is a huge plus. Their methods seem nearly identical on paper, and their results photos on this sub seem to be comparable as well.
</p>
<p>
So what am I missing? Why is Dr. Bank in such high demand compared to Dr. Chettawut?
</p>
<p>
Would I be making a huge mistake not spending another year or two for the consult-waitlist cycle on a few US surgeons (looking at Dr. Min Jun and Dr. Bluebond-Langner so far) or waiting to try for Dr. Bank again in May?
</p>
<p>
Thank you in advance.

I’ve seen some not so good results with Chett but also some good ones too. Seems inconsistent imo

Thank you.

Yeah, that is a vibe I&#39;ve gotten from the comments sections, but I haven&#39;t actually seen any of the not so good results myself, I don&#39;t think. Or at least nothing less good than the lesser end of anyone else, including Dr. Bank. If you had any particular not so good cases in mind, I&#39;d be grateful!

I&#39;ve never seen a bad outcome from Dr Bank. What ones have you seen, and having seen that, how have you not seen the negative Chett ones? There were a couple over the last few months.

If it makes you feel better, I ended up with Dr Sutin because he seemed to have the most consistently good results with the exception of Dr Bank (but I cannot wait that long, it&#39;s expensive, and the recovery is notoriously rough).
</p>
<p>
Dr Chettawut has some stunning results that look perfect so soon after the procedure, but like you&#39;ve mentioned, the consistency isn&#39;t the best

I did my surgery with doctor Chettawut couple months ago . When I did my first surgery after a week i got infected my vagina had swollen and the doctor asked me for a second surgery with money of course . My appearance of my vagina was great but the problems started after 3 months . I was doing my schedule on dilation like the program but I couldn’t accept no 3 . It was like in the beginning of my canal something was very tight . I send the several mails and they kept telling me you have to push it and continue . Now doctor send me an email telling me that there was a problem with my skin graft and has some scar and that I need to go back to have a second surgery colonvaginoplasty. Practically now I have a great pussy but I cannot use it . I am disappointed and shocked cause I don’t want to live this hell again .

Chett girl here.  7 months post op. I did not have the infection or complication like you did, Ninja Horror. My recovery was without complications or infections. And I love my aesthetic result.
</p>
<p>
But I’m not gonna lie, dilator 3 was VERY difficult to start.  The first time I tried it was like hitting a brick wall.
</p>
<p>
The initial moment, even using all the techniques I had been taught, and using voltaren and ibuprofen 20 min ahead of time, relaxation and breathing techniques, sent me into a minor panic attack (I don’t get those… but I did that day), and tears.
</p>
<p>
After I calmed down - I went for - a double shot of whiskey.  After a mental restart, calming down, and an absolute F ton of lube, I tried again.  Same thing.  Brick wall.
</p>
<p>
Back to breathing and going back to basics in body position, pillows positioning and what the nurses taught. More lube, and finally a little bit of progress.  The opening was tight. More self calming talk, lube, breathing and relaxation. And determination.
</p>
<p>
(All this time being very careful and listening to my body so as not to injure myself).
</p>
<p>
It was partially in.  Relaxing more , and more lube.  Turning the dilator slightly while pushing and trying to get in, I had to use a fair bit of force.  I felt like a goddamn piece of stubborn IKEA furniture.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I made it to full depth.  (7 inches for me). The first third, and half length of the dilator was clearly the hardest. I repeated my new procedure (including the whiskey) the next times, and was able to make it work consistently.
</p>
<p>
Now I easily use number 4 and purchased a 5 that I will try soon.  (Don’t need the whiskey anymore, lol.)
</p>
<p>
But going back to number 3.  That was a helluva thing.  And my heart goes out to you and the other girls who have a major issue with it.

Thank you so much for your comment cause I am so so disappointed and your comment made me hope . My aisthitical result is amazing . Maybe the best result of doctor Chettawut I have ever seen . To finally accept number 3  I had to buy another dilator similar with dilator 3 size but in the begging is not so fat. I put this first and after that I can use the doctors dilator number 3 . I have some questions for you . How many times do you do dilation and for how long ??? Have you had full intercourse ( sex) ?  For how long did you use number 3 and you saw that the opening is not wall anymore ? Cause this time every time I put number 3 inside me is like it’s the first time . The same pain the same desperation. Plz if you have the kindness help me cause I am not well . I would appreciate if you gave me as many details as possible on your squedule of using 3 and 4 , what positions …. Thank you again

Hi NinjaHorror, glad to be of help.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
first of all / you had a really good idea of getting a dilator between the diameter of 2 and 3.  I wish I had had one before I started with 3
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I take dilation VERY seriously.  So I have never missed one dilation session and have dilated for the daily required dilation 100 percent.  Have not missed a day.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
so every day I dilate the required 150 minutes a day.  The recommendation is for 3 sessions at 50 minutes each.  And I did that for the first 4 months.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
but then I found I could split up the time differently —. So one day I was supposed to go dancing with some girlfriends at night, so I got up early, and did the first two sessions together, so I only did two sessions - the morning was 100 minutes long, and the lunchtime session was the usual 50 minutes.  So it still was 150 minutes a day - but done in two sessions and I had time in the evening for dancing and drinks and could stay out late.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I did this only occasionally but has now become the norm.  Once again - always doing 150 minutes a day.  But starting at about 5 to 6 months - done in two sessions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
at 7 months post-op, I still have not had full intercourse (received vaginal penetrative sex).  I’ve had several offers, lol!    But I didn’t feel my body was ready, healing wise .  I do feel ready now.  I gave a rather challenging silicone sex toy a go a couple days ago.  It’s a smooth and somewhere the diameter of number 4 and 5.  It’s a smoother sculptural representative of the real thing, and it was slightly difficult to get in and slightly painful at first, but intense and pleasurable.  Strangely the remaining two inches of length went in easily.  I imagine that’s as close as I’ll get to the real thing before having - the real thing.
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: I used lots of lube, and there was no bleeding.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
after having success with number 3 it took only a couple of days for it not to be a wall and got easier and easier as time went on.  The transition to number 4 was really easy, kind of the way going from diameter 1 to 2 went.  No more ‘like hitting a wall’
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
to go from dilator 2 to 3 I found a technique to loosen me up.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before going from 2 to 3 in a dilation session, I would take number 2 and insert to full depth and move it around like a joystick.  I would move it in a starfish pattern.  I would do this for ten minutes using the number two.  And THEN I would move on to two fingers!
</p>
<p>
Remember how the nurses taught to apply lube internally with one gloved finger?  I just borrowed that technique and used two fingers.
</p>
<p>
And once in, try to spread the fingers apart a bit around the muscle wall to open things up. And do this at different angles.
</p>
<p>
Those would help me get to number 3.
</p>
<p>
Also there is a description and small autoplay video on dilation that includes leg positions on Dr Chettawut’s WIH Hospital website:

<a href="https://www.wihhospital.com/gender-affirming-services-male-to-female-gender-affirming-surgery-vaginal-dilation-routine-after-for-gender-affirming-surgery/">Dr Chettawut’s dilation instructions
</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
doing things as I have, I have maintained the full 7 inch depth I had when they first measured me in the hospital
</li>
</ul>

Dr Bank provide better aesthetic and better results overall.
</p>
<p>
One of or actually the only surgeon who able to provide you with labia minora around the canal opening in the first surgery without failing?
</p>
<p>
Usually if you wish that aesthetic you&#39;d need a revision later on. (which bank also provide for free if you want)
</p>
<p>
Please remember that when you make this decision it&#39;s a life-long decision... don&#39;t lose your patience. I was also feeling that I can&#39;t wait any longer and instead of going with Bank I went with a horrible doctor and now I am just suffering. I could wait this 2 years for Dr. Bank and be happy... instead I been waiting that much time in agony and complications for a revision fix somewhere for being impatience.
</p>
<p>
There is a reason why the wait list is so huge, there is a reason why the demand so high... wish you best of luck with your decisions.

Let&#39;s talk when the honeymoon phase is over. Come back 3 months+ after recovery when scars begin to form and heal. I was also happy the first 2 months.

Sorry - but that&#39;s nonsense!
</p>
<p>
My scars have almost all healed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now doing sports every day again and preparing for my next operation in Turkey at the beginning of March.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t be able to do any of this if it hadn&#39;t already healed so well.
</p>
<p>
For a while I found this honeymoon story quite funny - but no matter how difficult it may be for you, you should accept that there are patients who are very satisfied with the results of Kamol.
</p>
<p>
Or do you still want to accuse me after six months that I&#39;m in a honeymoon phase just because I&#39;m doing well and I&#39;m still happy?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
As I said, I think it&#39;s a shame that it obviously wasn&#39;t that successful for you.
</p>
<p>
But every person heals differently and almost every doctor sometimes has results that are not so perfect - as do other doctors such as Suporn and Bank.

For me, the decision to go with Dr. chett over banks was time mostly.  I have the money, but at 47, I dont want to wait up to 2 more years for an aesthetically superior but similar functioning result.  Dr. chettawut consistently produces anatomically correct, fully functioning, and to my eye pleasing results.  If i was younger, I would &#34;maybe&#34; wait a cycle or two for banks, but if i didn&#39;t get in, that would disappoint more, probably?  It&#39;s your choice
</p>
<p>
I asked myself, if only my partner and I can see a chett result would i be satisfied?  YES!  so i am booked for sept... :)
</p>
<p>
Whatever your choice enjoy!

Thank you very much - it sounds like we&#39;re in very similar situations. I&#39;m 33, but still feeling like another two years is too many...
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind sharing, what is it about Dr. Bank&#39;s results that are aesthetically superior?

<p>
take a look at a banks result above vs the chett result.  as mentioned in another reply, banks consistently has labia minora around the vagina while chett usually stops just before the vagina.  it results in an &#34;open&#34; vaginal look for chett while banks has more of a &#34;closed&#34; one.
</p>
<p>
you really want to decide what results you are comfortable with.  look around here, lots of results from different surgeons are here.  all your top docs, banks, chett, theerapong, min jun, etc have their own style and aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
best wishes in your journey!

I started HRT at 36 so I feel you on this. I don&#39;t want to say what the right choice would be for you, but I felt similar when I started- I&#39;d already missed so much of my young life, I don&#39;t want to miss any more of it. It&#39;s frustrating to choose between what you really want but has a longer line versus what seems wholly acceptable and available sooner.
</p>
<p>
I went with Jun or RBL with a longer wait with no regrets. Every day that passed was still one day closer and I was able to spend the waiting time getting other surgical procedures that don&#39;t have as long lines. I have a date with RBL and the total wait will end up being about 2-1/2 years. But in that time I&#39;ve been able to get both FFS and VFS performed and not be in a panic whether hair removal is going fast enough.

Heya, OP.  I was in a similar spot to you,  But I also knew personally some girls who had their work done by Dr. Chettawut and were happy with their results.  I went in for my SRS with him in July of last year.
</p>
<p>
I have had no complications or infections.  My depth is 7 inches, and I am very happy with the aesthetics.  I showed pics of myself to a couple of my lovely cis friends, and they were tremendously complimentary.
</p>
<p>
And based on my experience, in talking with a girl I met online while I was out there (she went with Dr Banks), it sounds like I had better, more comprehensive after care staying at the WIH Hospital with Dr. Chettawut.  It really was exceptional.

Thank you Equivalent Evening.🌺
</p>
<p>
So my wife and I stayed 30 days total.
</p>
<p>
I had to look at my records for the cost.  So my payment summary says the entire total for WIH Hospital and SRS with Dr Chettawut to be 530,000 thb., total.
</p>
<p>
I had listed 96,000 of that number cost for the stay at Bangkok Rama.  (I had initially elected to stay at the hotel they used to offer as a choice at the time.). At the in person consultation with Dr. Chettawut, 3 days before the surgery, I was convinced it was a much better idea to stay at the hospital.  The WIH team and Dr Chettawut’s office coordinated the change, took care of the paperwork and picked us up and transferred us to the hospital 2 days before the surgery. Now their office policy requires everyone stay at the hospital post surgery.  There was an extra bed for my wife.
</p>
<p>
The care was excellent, the nurses and staff were wonderful.
</p>
<p>
So the breakdown was this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
SRS with skin graft = 420,000 thb
</li>
<li>
visit with THAI psychiatrist = 10,000 thb
</li>
<li>
COVID test, pcr test for me 72 hours before surgery = 3,300 thb
</li>
<li>
COVID rapid antigen test for my wife = 700 thb
</li>
<li>
accomodation (30 nights total) for me and my wife = 96,000 thb
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So just convert THAI Baht into the currency of your country and you have your cost.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes and best of luck to you! 🌸🌺

I went to Chettawut in 2018. I healed fine but I have a less than ideal result. I believe dr chett is overworked and has gotten sloppy. He basically runs an assembly line and works his staff like Sri 24/7. I had some kind of complication, but they wouldn’t say what, but I had to have two bags of blood transfusion. I had minimal depth but I have hair in the urethral opening which is impossible to remove and causes frequent infections. I also would say that I lost 60 to 75% of my sensitivity and unfortunately I live in a very hot climate and as we all know scrotal skin sags when it’s warm out. So the labia he created from my scrotum sags and gets caught/pinched between my legs when I’m walking. It’s frequently painful and I have to readjust it often. The stress of having had bottom surgery and it not being what I thought it would be/what people told me it would be has been detrimental to my mental health, and eventually caused me to detransition. When I get aroused, it still feels like I have a penis, but when I go to touch parts of my neovagina I either feel numbness, or I feel pinching or I feel sensitivity, but it feels muddled. I regret having bottom surgery and I regret going to chettawut  because well I heard so many people say that his result was so wonderful and perfect and nearly identical to Dr. Suporn I found it to be completely untrue.

Seconding this, sadly. I had surgery with him in 2015 and was deciding between him and Suporn back then.
</p>
<p>
Maybe they were closer in results in 2005...but Suporn has only gotten much better while Chettawut has gotten much sloppier.

I think this is only for the PPT graft. The skin graft is just over half the cost (not including the hotel), so closer to $25k USD

Hello, Chett girl here. Had SRS in 2015 and it was the biggest regret of my life.
</p>
<p>
No major complications but I was just very underwhelmed by the aesthetics. Went for a revision with him but it didn&#39;t improve anything and I&#39;ve contemplated ending my life several times. I&#39;m going for another revision with PAI soon and I&#39;m hoping things will turn out better.
</p>
<p>
Based on my personal experience, I simply cannot recommend Chettawut to anyone. I simply do not think his results are very good, and I do not think he&#39;s consistent at all in his results. A few months or a year might seem like a long time today, but there&#39;s simply no point in compromising and picking a different surgeon only to spend the next 10 years of your life regretting and trying to fix it.
</p>
<p>
Very few people go through such a major and lifechanging surgery as we do. You want to focus all of your resources and energy on getting it right the first time, and not feel and regret that you had to compromise anything for it.

Functionally I guess I don&#39;t have much to complain about. I&#39;m not sure if things work as well as other surgeons but at least nothing appears to be broken.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Vagina: 5.5 inch depth. No sensation.
</li>
<li>
Clit: Too sensitive. It&#39;s like touching your eyeball. Sensitive but hurts and not pleasuarable.
</li>
<li>
Peeing: Works I guess, but for the life of me I can&#39;t pee straight without it running down my legs. It&#39;s also located at the entrance of the vagina which I&#39;ve read does often happen to older women who have given birth.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Appearance: This has always been my biggest problem. It feels like &#34;mound&#34; of flesh. Neither me, nor could the other 2 girls who were there for surgery could tell what were we looking at. Was that the inner labia? Outer labia? Where is the clit? What&#39;s this? What&#39;s that? Where does my pee come out of? Why doesn&#39;t it look anything like the medical diagram of a vulva?
</p>
<p>
On at least 3 occasions, I&#39;ve had medical staff make comments along the following lines - &#34;oh they removed your clit / they didn&#39;t give you a clit&#34;. Every time I have to subject some random stranger to looking at my &#34;vagina&#34;, I always feel like dying of embarassment.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most insulting part was the gaslighting. I consulted with a few other surgeons and all of them said that there were several things that they could fix. However Chett&#39;s comment was simply along the lines of,
<em>
&#34;Revision? Why would you want that? YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL AND NATURAL LIKE A REAL WOMAN.&#34;
</em>
</p>
<p>
Thing I&#39;ve noticed for many of his results:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
No clitorial hood
</li>
<li>
No labia folds
</li>
<li>
Saggy and loose labia majora
</li>
<li>
Ill defined labia minora
</li>
<li>
Gaping caved-in vagina hole
</li>
<li>
Poor symmetry
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Perhaps there are some who love his results. I&#39;m not one of them. I&#39;m only 3 days post-op with PAI and already I&#39;m far, far happier with body than I&#39;ve ever been in the last 9 years.

When I first applied to gender reassignment surgery mtf for funding in Canada, my family doctor gave me a long consultation about the probable complications of this surgery. She paid attention to the fact that this surgery has lots of risks and risks of complications. She emphasized you might have these complications with any surgeon on earth. No surgeon can guarantee a faultless result which will have no complications. She was soo strict about these and wanted to see I take all these into account and ready. If you are not ready for probable complications after surgery, she said “you are not a good candidate for this surgery.”
</p>
<p>
When it comes to the results of unwanted aesthetics and complications of srs ;smoking, age , use of drugs, alcohol, skin type and even colour have a great effect on the result. Gender reassignment surgery is also a surgery that may not be completed with only one operation for satisfactory results . Therefore Suporn offers free revisions, they are aware of this.
</p>
<p>
The patient’s anatomy is also very important for these surgeries.if you are overweight, complication risk is higher. The doctor also may not be on his best day everyday. So, some results may not be as impressive as others. For example I have been a teacher for  many years and I sometimes see that I teach much better than the previous day or sometimes much worse.Nobody can show the same best and brilliant performance everyday, this is improbable. We are not robots. So this also means there is a CHANCE factor and we have to accept this. I have talked to a girl who had her surgery with Min jun(considered to be the best) but she sued him and had revisions with another US surgeon.
</p>
<p>
As a result, surgeries are like throwing dices and the more complicated the surgery is, the more complications and risks there are coming with.
</p>
<p>
To sum up, I am having my SRS with dr Chettawut at the end of this month and sincerely hope it will go smoothly. I am so happy that I will get rid of a piece of meat which I have never felt belonging to my body and soul since born. I wish a surgery with no complications to all my sisters, and this is what we just need in our journeys.

Pretty unhelpful non-response consisting almost entirely of information of which anyone asking the original question is already well aware.
</p>
<p>
I had an in-person consultation with Dr Chettawut this week having been on Dr Bank’s waitlist for two years - and waiting for GRS, frustrated by the paucity of reliable information and willingness of surgeons to be open about their procedures and results for many years.
</p>
<p>
I found him to be arrogant and condescending and I left feeling disappointed that I felt I could not trust him with my once-in-this-life surgery. He was evasive when I asked about details of his technique as though he feared I wanted to steal a secret. His response was essentially that he was a rockstar and I should just trust him. He gave the impression that I should be grateful he would take me. I consider the surgeon-patient relationship one in which I am placing immense trust with my life, health and future - not to mention an enormous sum of money - in their hands and that that deserves total transparency and accountability and a forthright open conversation. He wasn’t having it. I expect many younger transitioners, impatient and ignorant of anatomy and the appearance and differences between sexes in the urogenital tract, would rush to him but he really turned me off with his bedside manner. I asked if he had any examples of his work he could show me and his response was simply that every patient has individual results and he did not want to risk me having expectations of a particular result. Duh. I told him I was interested in his consistency of results and understood completely about individual outcomes having already had extensive FFS and other surgeries. He seemed to be irritated by this and with almost no answers to my questions and nothing more than the two cherry-picked examples on his website to go on , I left. It was extremely disappointing to travel so far for this and leave with nothing.
</p>
<p>
My partner had her GRS with Suporn about 20 years ago. I considered myself straight as a guy before transition and thanks to a mix of intense dysphoria, confusion and obsession with the female body I have been a connoisseur of vulva for decades. Her result with Suporn is indistinguishable from natal for anyone not extremely familiar with GRS. She had no complications of surgery and healed quite quickly but required a revision a few months after surgery. It was done for free. Hers may be an exceptional result, but that along with Suporn’s fantastic bedside manner, genuine compassion and aftercare - and consequently word of mouth - may be why his successor, Dr Bank, has such a long waiting list.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the above, Dr Chett may be an excellent surgeon and his results may be fantastic. I just can’t tell this side of surgery. I am still considering him. I am grateful for this sub and girls willing to share photos and experiences but I am cautious knowing that it is self filtering. My search unfortunately continues.

I did not do SRS, but i did FFS with Chettawut in January of 2018. I am still very happy with the results  :) The correspondence on mail was fantastic and quick. The only thing is that Chettawut was very quick during the consultation (the day before the surgery), but then again I was 19 y old and had already gotten much info on mail. Other than that it went well and the payment was never an issue either. Before he ran his own clinic &#39;&#39;Chettawut Plastic Surgery Center&#39;&#39; but he has since relocated and works at WIH International Hospital now. But yeah, I can&#39;t speak for the SRS part, but I know a person who had it done there in 2017 and she told me she&#39;s very happy with her SRS result. She told me they removed the hair follicles during surgery, so you won&#39;t have to do laser hair removal before the surgery? Anyway, Chettawut has much experience when it comes to both FFS and SRS, and you find bad reviews on all surgeons everywhere. As long as you do your research and feel comfortable with the surgeon you&#39;re going for, then I think you&#39;re doing a good decision! :)

What reasons could it possibly be? Quality, price, marketing, waitlist? Anything else?
</p>
<p>
Look in the wiki here with a web browser.

Thanks, yeah, I&#39;ve read the wiki extensively. Over half the links for Chettawut are dead/deleted posts. And, the question is &#34;why is his waitlist short,&#34; so waitlist isn&#39;t a very helpful answer.

Alot of people are deleting thier posts because of anti trans hysteria. Alot of terfs are sharing posts and post op pics to mock users or to prove thier own biases to thier ingroups, which is why alot of pics a removed soon after posting. Don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily because something horrible happened or they are fake.

Also a lot of SRS photos were hosted on Imgur, which started removing NSFW images last year.

It’s a good answer if you understand my point.
</p>
<p>
Bank costs more and much worse wait list. Neither have any marketing, though Chettawut’s website is better. Doesn’t leave much else apart from quality.

I think word of mouth can count as marketing, especially when you operate in a way that seems to be designed to generate a hype cycle several times a year. I&#39;ve never heard of any other medical practitioner using a public lottery to determine who has access to a medical service. I do understand and appreciate the community&#39;s theory that it&#39;s more equananimous, but it also makes me really suspicious, because it is fundamentally arbitrary and therefore kind of cruel.
</p>
<p>
If it were about serving need equally, medical triage has a very long history.
</p>
<p>
That aside, your analysis leaves
<em>
perceived
</em>
quality, which given how little scientific and medical data is actually available, and how much everyone&#39;s strong opinions are based on a few dozen selfies... I can&#39;t say that I see perceived quality mapping very strictly to actual quality. There aren&#39;t any anonymized surveys about patient satisfaction, there aren&#39;t any statistics about overall long-term functionality by surgeon, etc.
</p>
<p>
Everyone sees the fundamental flaw that anonymous forum posts can be astroturfed or outright paid ads when it comes to Dr. Kamol, but somehow that&#39;s a blind spot when it comes to people&#39;s favorite surgeons here.

I don’t think Suporn’s lottery is some smart marketing plan. It’s just some weird idea they came up with because they are really bad at business. It’s also fairly recent and things were much the same before vs Chettawut.
</p>
<p>
If they were actually good at business they would significantly increase the price, and keep putting up as high as it can bear.
</p>
<p>
I did mean the quality was perceived as there’s no way of judging any surgeons apart from that.
</p>
<p>
Facial Team is an example of good business. Totally different.

No they don’t, that’s why it works, and there’s others.
