Can someone tell me their experience with Dr. Gabriel del Corral? Anyone that has had their bottom surgery done by him.

The surgical center (brand new) is part of Medstar Franklin Square Hospital. You stay at least 7 days in a private room. The nurses and staff were excellent. I cannot say enough kind words about them...they really took care of me. The food was meh...but I was on a special diet so my choices were limited.  When I was there last September, there were visitor restrictions in place due to Covid so keep that in mind. One person per day.  Youâ€™ll have a wound vac over everything for the first few days but this helps with the healing time and process. With that said youâ€™ll be immobile in the beginning. A book, my phone with music and games kept me mostly occupied. A laptop or tablet is too heavy especially if you have BA at the same time like I did.  Before you go home at the end of the week, theyâ€™ll teach you how to dilate and all of the post op care. (Donâ€™t stray from the schedule!!) Doctor Del Corral visited me a couple of times during my stay as well as a PA (Andy ðŸ¥°)and some interns. Everyone was very attentive and affirming.  I live several hours from Baltimore and the ride home in the passenger seat was rough. Donâ€™t push yourself too fast. Make sure you have a caregiver to help you first week at home.  Once I was home...I had some wound dehiscence which is a common complication. Prescription ointment healed it within a few weeks.  The dilation schedule is a challenge and Iâ€™m still healing of course with some slight swelling still present. In total Iâ€™m very happy with the results!

Thank you for your telling me about your experience. I think I will end up choosing dr del Corral for my bottom surgery. So far Iâ€™ve heard good comments about him and his team and of all his work.

How are the overall astetics? Your last comment was 1 year ago, so if you happen to reply Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll have a good answer by now. My main concerns are looks and depth, and I am strongly considering dr corral. Iâ€™ve heard good things but would you say it looks decent?

Iâ€™m very happy with the results! Depth is fine as wellâ€¦just have to keep up with dilation schedule.  Life is so much better now than before. I had a follow up recently and everything went well:)

I wanted to know how your experience was with him since the first time you guys met. Are you honestly happy with your results? Have you ever had any complications? Did you get worried at any time during your procedure?

He&#39;s very nice and easy to talk to. His office was helpful and processed everything quickly. I&#39;m honestly happy. Zero complications. I was zonked out during the procedure. But I was never worried during recovery, but it is a long slog to heal up.

Thanks for letting me know about your experience. Iâ€™m honestly looking for a doctor because Iâ€™m ready to start my bottom surgery. Iâ€™m taking the first step to have a consultation with him. Iâ€™m interested in knowing as much information about him as I can. Where I live there are no doctors with much experience with bottom surgery. How long where you in the hospital after the surgery?

6 or 7 days. I lived not too far away, so I went straight home after that for the rest or recovery.

He recommends but does not require it (because he does remove it as part of the process). He said laser or electrolysis are both fine, but he leans towards laser.
