I had breast augmentation surgery with Dr. Tanya Judge in March, 2022. I‚Äôm a really big fan of her, her staff, and the results. She was thorough with her explanation of the process, how to pick out a size, and provided plenty of technical details where I asked for them. I felt at ease under her care.
</p>
<p>
I planned to have BA with her in February, but there was an issue in the operating room and we had to reschedule. Essentially, I had a patch of eczema near the incision site they were concerned was actually a skin infection, and they were worried it could contaminate the implant. It was partially on me! I didn‚Äôt mention my eczema to Dr. Judge because it‚Äôs so normal for me I don‚Äôt even think about it as a health issue to be brought up. Dr. Judge recommended me a dermatologist and said she would make time in her schedule to operate on me whenever was most convenient for me. The dermatologist confirmed the eczema was a non-issue, and we did the make-up surgery about a month later. She didn&#39;t have to do all that for me, and I really appreciated it!
</p>
<p>
Payment was my simplest interaction with medical billing ever: They charged my card for $7.5k and that was it. No surprise bills from the hospital / anesthesiologist, no billing departments to chase, no fees for needing to reschedule. Part of that was probably the fact that I was paying cash, but still.
</p>
<p>
Recovery took about a week before I could move my arms freely enough to get back to life as normal-ish. There was no overnight hospital stay. I didn‚Äôt have much pain from the operation, although my shoulders and lower back were incredibly sore from the hunched posture I needed to adopt to keep pressure off my chest muscles. I had follow-ups for the first several months, but now I‚Äôve been ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù and future care will be between me and my GP. The biggest thing I had to get used to was the sensation of having something underneath my chest muscles. It felt very strange and foreign, especially when my muscles moved while picking up heavier things or shivering. I‚Äôm still not entirely used to feeling the inserts when I work out üòÖ but over time I‚Äôve stopped noticing the sensation so much and it‚Äôs just become normal! It‚Äôs like how you feel your socks when you first put them on, but eventually it becomes the baseline and your brain stops reminding you about it.
</p>
<p>
I got a 320cc insert, aiming to end up between a B and C cup. We oveshot a little and I ended up with closer to a D, but I‚Äôm still very happy with the results! Cup sizes are pretty variable between brands anyways. I‚Äôd say the results are very natural looking overall, which was my main ask. They don‚Äôt deform as much under gravity or touch as boobs without inserts, but I can only really feel the inserts along the incision scars or when they‚Äôre pushed in a direction quite a bit. The scars are about 3cm long, and thus pretty noticeable if you‚Äôre looking, but are positioned in such a way that they‚Äôre not obvious from the front. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll continue to lighten over time. I‚Äôve been using silicone scar gel / tapes to hasten the healing process. I feel like they‚Äôve been effective, but also I don‚Äôt have a control scar I‚Äôm testing in parallel.
</p>
<p>
I was moderately dysphoric about my chest before, and getting BA pretty much completely got rid of that üòä I‚Äôm definitely happier and more confident with how my chest looks now! I‚Äôm comfortable wearing way more types of outfits. In the past, I picked up some tops I thought of as ‚Äúpost BA items‚Äù; things that were cute, didn‚Äôt look good on me at the time, but I hoped one day would. Wearing them after the operation was a really nice full circle moment ü•∞
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions I‚Äôd be more than happy to answer them!

How was the process like to decide what size implant you wanted, over vs under the muscle etc?
</p>
<p>
For me, one of the big things is to end up not too big (B or C would be good), and looking natural is very important. Dr Judge ranks highly on my list since it sounds like she listens to your needs very well.
</p>
<p>
Did you try to claim any of the cost from insurance after the surgery?

I should&#39;ve mentioned that! I didn&#39;t have much breast tissue, so Dr. Judge (and the other BA surgeon I consulted with) said they would recommend dual-plane to make the outline of the implant less obvious while preventing the &#34;hardness&#34; that would come from a full under-muscle option in my case.
</p>
<p>
With regards to the process, she had a number of silicon sizers. They sit on your chest and give you an idea of how a given volume will look on you, kinda like a longer breast form. To be clear they don&#39;t look much like the actual implant itself! I picked the implant volume based on what sizer volume I liked best.
</p>
<p>
I did not try to file a claim with insurance. IIRC my insurance plan did not cover procedures regarded as cosmetic. I probably should&#39;ve tried to get it pre-authed, just in case I lucked out, but oh well.
