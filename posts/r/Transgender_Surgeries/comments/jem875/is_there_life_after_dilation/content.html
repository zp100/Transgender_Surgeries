4 months. Hanging in there. Trying to stay positive. Never missed one. It does take determination though. I took the orange one relatively easily after 6 weeks post-op.
</p>
<p>
I think the biggest lesson for me was it wasn&#39;t me who wasn&#39;t happy about it. It&#39;s people around me got frustrated that I&#39;m not very productive because of dilation.

What&#39;s the process like? Like, can you do other things? I assume you can&#39;t move and I guess probably can&#39;t work even with WFH, but can you at least read or watch TV/YouTube, or does it actually require constant attention and adjustment and pain?

At least one hand is busy holding the dilator. Some people come with way to hold it without a hand (e.g. by foot), but I don&#39;t like it. You will need another hand to apply lube, hold a mirror to insert the dilator, set it aside once you are done with it. I also need to apply hydrocortisone to deal with the granulation tissue. Your hands may get messy with the lube. You cannot walk or sit. Your upper body is supposed to be at 45 degrees relative to the surface. After you are done, you would need to clean yourself (as there may be lube and you don&#39;t want it to be a feeding ground for bacteria), wash the dilators, put away the bed pad, dilators, lube, mirror, etc.
</p>
<p>
For obvious reasons, I don&#39;t try to Zoom during this time. You don&#39;t want your dilators to be featured in your Zoom call.
</p>
<p>
You should be able to read emails, watch a movie, type text with one hand.
</p>
<p>
Curious if others came up with a more efficient process.
</p>
<p>
For me one session takes about 1.5 hours (12 min each dilator plus changeover time plus setup and cleanup time).

You&#39;re vagina will adjust as you size up dilators. Orange looks intimating, but by the time you are on green, it&#39;s not as bad as it looks.

I’m just over four weeks for dilation and I’m on size #2. I still have some pain but I’m in no rush to move to the next size. Honestly I don’t think I’ll ever get to size #4 (orange). Yes, it’s a challenge to do this three times a day but I just keep thinking of the big picture. I didn’t go through all of this to give up now and have my vagina close up. My routine is to lay back, concentrate on breathing and listen to my Spotify while surfing Reddit, Quora, etc. Before I know it the 30 minutes are done. Take it one day at a time and you can do this!!!

Honestly? I gave up. After a year and a half of dilation I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I found out I didn&#39;t enjoy penetrative sex, I could never get any sexual feeling from my vagina and my meds had destroyed my sex drive. Dilation became a chore, something I loathed every day and then every week. I just couldn&#39;t do it anymore. So I stopped. I&#39;ve lost all my depth, but at least I have my life back.

As someone currently being frightened by this and other posts and leaning strongly towards zero-depth, how literal is this?
</p>
<p>
Like it

actually

closed up? Or in practice you lost like half the depth? Or...?

It took a month to get to orange and didn&#39;t hurt at all or require much effort.
</p>
<p>
Everyone&#39;s different, and you pick the routine that&#39;s best for you without comparing.  There&#39;s really no reason to get to orange unless your sex life dictates it.

Suporn&#39;s schedule is 3x a day for 3 mo, 2x a day for 3mo, 1x a day for 6mo and then you can slowly start tapering down from there.

Well, dilation was going well for me, but about 2 weeks before I was supposed to go down to 2x a day I started a new job. I was pretty much exhausted all the time and ended up going down to twice a day when I started working. I went on a camping trip and for 2 days and tried to dilate every night but became too paranoid of the sounds I was making in my tent in the middle of the night, so stopped. Then I got sick, really sick, it started the day after getting back and 1 day later I was in the hospital. I think I was there for maybe 4 days, anyway, that caused me to lose about 1cm depth.  Then about a month before I was supposed to, I went down to once a day. I just couldn&#39;t keep up anymore. Then I got sick again and ended up in hospital for a week, that definitely didn&#39;t help. Somewhere between 9mo and 1.5y I lost about 2 more cm. I even tried dilating every day again using a lot of pressure, but all that did was hurt me inside to the point where I couldn&#39;t dilate because of the pain for over a week.
</p>
<p>
At the end of Nov it&#39;ll be 2 years for me and I&#39;m down from my original 17cm to 14cm now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve given up trying and just dilate once a week now. I can&#39;t cope with life and dilation.
</p>
<p>
I do feel like if I had been more diligent and obviously not had gotten sick, I wouldn&#39;t have lost as much.

Eh, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m so tight that I struggle to get anything in there anyway and the person I&#39;m dating isn&#39;t very big either. I need to dilate now actually, 🤦🏻‍♀️ fun fun fun.

For me, it became a ritual of sorts. I’d set myself up in my bedroom and have some uninterrupted time for whatever I wanted to keep my mind off of the dilation itself. I caught up on a bunch of shows, read some books, and chatted with friends. That time is for
<em>
me
</em>
, and I refuse to do anything during that time resembling work or drudgery.
</p>
<p>
I’m 21 months post, and I dilate about twice weekly. When I was shortly post-op, orange scared me too. It got better. It wasn’t
<em>
comfortable
</em>
sizing up, but with time and patience, it wasn’t painful either. The biggest thing with dilation for me was the time commitment. The only person I’d hurt if I didn’t keep up with dilation was myself, and I’ve already hurt myself enough in this lifetime - there’s no need to keep doing it.
</p>
<p>
I hope your dilation gets better for you. With time, it can become a sacred period in your day/week. I began to look forward to dilation for the downtime it meant I’d have. I kind of miss it now that I’m dilating less frequently these days.

You&#39;re just a week in, you&#39;re healing, it&#39;s going to get easier. The first time you move up in size it may be a little painful, but just be patient and give yourself extra time during those. After that first time with each it really won&#39;t be a big deal.

I&#39;m 18 months.  I dilate every 4 days (if I dilate less frequently it feels, uh, &#34;tighter&#34;). It&#39;s not painful (not comfortable either).  I dilate with the largest dilator.  I save play for fun, I don&#39;t enjoy being stretched like I am during dilation (I.E. it&#39;s not fun to me!) during play, so that&#39;s why I still dilate. I kind of do a Zen thing - it&#39;s my 100% &#34;me&#34; time. I can lay down, relax, not be disturbed, and watch some TV or something I might enjoy.  Sometimes after I finish, since I&#39;m already going to need to wash up, I might as well have some fun too.  :)
</p>
<p>
That said, I would move up as fast as your surgeon will let you because you&#39;ll have more flexibility early on than later - not saying you can&#39;t do it later too, just that it might be harder. But obviously listen to your surgeon so you don&#39;t hurt yourself.

I mean you are still doing it 4 times a day at 18 months. Most people do once a day.

The person you responded to said once every 4 days not 4 times a day, you read it backwards.

No, definitely am not doing 4 times a day!  I only had to do 4 times a day for 6 weeks or so (I&#39;m going by memory so may be somewhat off here).
</p>
<p>
Today I dilate on say Monday; do nothing on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; and then dilate again on Friday; then skip Saturday, Sunday, &amp; Monday before dilating on Tuesday.  Hope that helps.  :)

Hi, sweetie.  I used Soul Source dilators, and I remember being terrified moving up from the puny orange one.  But it was no problem.  Just remember to lube the daylights out of yourself and go slow; before you know it, you&#39;ll be up to the inch and a half school bus in no time (I had to order that one separately as it did not come in my original set of four).  You&#39;ll stretch naturally.  In time, you&#39;ll pop the first one in just for the hell of it and finally get to ask &#34;is it in yet?&#34;  lmao
</p>
<p>
The key is to go slow and try and stimulate yourself when you start your session; it helps a whole bunch.  If it hurts you&#39;re either not lubricating enough or you&#39;re going to fast (no-no&#39;s).  If it still hurts, be sure and speak with your surgeon about this.  There could be something wrong or it could be something as simple as temporarily downsizing and going longer sessions.
</p>
<p>
Just remember that dilation is lifelong.  Eventually, regular intercourse with toys or the real thing will count.  Either way, you know you&#39;ll have to do it for life.  Enjoy your new vagina (or as i affectionately call it as a deep southerner &#34;cooch&#34;).  I hope this helps.  Keep me posted!
</p>

Mari

They never even gave me the orange one. It’s likely much bigger than anyone I’ll be using my new bits with so I don’t see the need. And remember, if you maintain depth you can always work on diameter later if you so choose.

You may appreciate it more if you realize that some intersex folks have to do it all their lives and that was not quite their deliberate decision.

Reminder, you&#39;re only 1 week in. Focus on getting to the green #3 and then you can focus on to the orange big boy. How often do you get to see your doctor during during this healing period?

I had my srs with suporn and stopped dilating entirely after 4 years with no negative side effects and smth like &#34;the orange one&#34; (soulsource 38mm I assume?) would fit easily.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is a pain in the ass but it certainly gets much better, Especially when you do it properly at the beginning.
</p>
<p>
I did hear very different things about dilation long term but that&#39;s my story with it. I don&#39;t need it anymore.

Let’s me honest it’s probably one of the worst things about being Trans, dilation. That said at least we don’t have periods and can’t get pregnant. I know some actually want that but I certainly don’t :) I’m happy in the fact I have lived from both sides, I know how to please guys and how to act around woman. Trans people are honestly like the missing link when it comes to gender conformity rofl. That comes with a price I’m afraid. At least before you know it the amount you dilate will dramatically reduce :). Very best of luck to you x

Probably because they went pretty off topic. All they said that was relevant was dilation is the worst part of being trans... And they haven&#39;t even had to go through it themselves. They already said their surgery was canceled because of covid

I was trying to make a comparison to sis females and trans women.  I also don’t think you need to have cancer to feel for some one that has it. I could make further comparisons but I think you get the point. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t afraid of the op, I’m afraid that running away from my issues is all I know, I’m afraid that facing life as me will be boring compared to this image of me I try and portray that I’m relaxed and don’t care about anything, I’m frightened of complications and dilation for the rest of my life, but will that stop me going through with the op no it won’t. My boyfriend likes me as I am now, so I lose him too. There are far more negatives for me, i will be me but I will be alone. It’s what I have always wanted so I will continue with the op. But you always need to think very seriously about such things. I was trying to make her feel better. Yes being trans sucks and I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy, but we do anything to be us. Be positive, it will get better in time, I have plenty of trans friends that all say the same. Sorry to make it seem like a ‘me’ reply that wasn’t my intention. As I say I’m just trying to say that there are always people worse off than ourselves and dilation as much as it sucks is a small price to pay for being ourselves

I had the same problem for the first 3-6 months, but Dr. Kanit informed me that it was normal as the healing wound . Dilator of vagina will be very troublesome, but after 6 months the problem disappeared. You have to fight and be patient.
