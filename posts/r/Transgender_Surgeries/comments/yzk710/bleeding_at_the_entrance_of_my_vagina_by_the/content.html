I bled small amounts at first, but if you&#39;re really concerned the best option is to check in with your doctor.
</p>
<p>
Generally use a ton of lube. There&#39;s no such thing as too much. Also if that&#39;s not your smallest dilator,  start off with the smallest to warm up. I use 4 sizes when I dilate. It can be uncomfortable and there are things you can do to minimize that.
</p>
<p>
Also you&#39;re still very early in your recovery. It is natural to feel scared. Make sure you&#39;re keeping ahead of the pain. It can make everything seem much much worse. I&#39;m also going to repeat that the best course of action to soothe you in this situation is to check in with your doctor.
</p>
<p>
Bottom line is that you will be OK. Your body knows how to heal. Sometimes it needs an extra push, but this is something it does well. ðŸ’œ

So, the surgeon opinion, what is happening there will decide if it is okay or not. Please don&#39;t be afraid to ask.
<br>
You doing good.
<br>
And may I congratulate on this big step in your life.
<br>
Long way to go till full healing, but with everyday, you get closer.
<br>
Kisses, Cynthia

<p>
As an after thought, when ever your condition let you and you wish to share details about your surgery, it would be greatly appreciated. (Surgeon&#39;s name, location, type of surgery,etc)

Of course ask your surgeon but about a month after the surgery something like this happened to me as well. Basically blood from the surgery clots up inside your vagina and eventually it gets knocked loose and this is the result. It can be scary but it&#39;s normal and nothing is wrong. Just part of the process.
