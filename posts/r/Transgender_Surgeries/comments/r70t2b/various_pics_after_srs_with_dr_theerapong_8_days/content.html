Hi, I have some questions about your experience with Dr. Teerapong and your PPV (well, there are a lot of them), could you please help me? He is in my top 4 surgeons for my SRS: What made you decide for the PPV over the other&#39;s tecnique&#39;s? What made you choose Dr. Teerapong over other doctors? How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Teerapong? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? Are you satisfied with your results? Dr. Teerapong let you chose to have a certain type of aesthetics? Are you planning to have a revision surgery? (I don&#39;t think you need it, even with a short time since your surgery, it is clear that you will have a very good result when you are completely healed) What is your vaginal depth? How is lubrication with PPV?  How have the dilations been?, that&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.
</p>

Hey there! I haven&#39;t read this comment before I checked my messages on reddit. Of course I can help you.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I wanted PPV or sigmoid vaginoplasty at first because of lubrication, but I ended up with PPV when I realized that they don&#39;t actually cut off your peritoneum (it&#39;s peritoneal PULL-THROUGH) and that peritoneum  regenerates. i love the depth that sigmoid vaginoplasty can give, but I realized that they actually cut a part of my colon. I love my current depth (7 inches)
</li>
<li>
I was chooosing between Dr Kamol and Dr Theerapong (two surgeons that provide PPV), but then I met Siam Transformation (an agency who works for Dr Theerapong). One good point is that Kamol Gardens actually requires you to stay at a certain hotel while Dr Theerapong doesn&#39;t. I sensed that Siam Transformative actually cares for their patients and that they&#39;re not just after my money. It&#39;s not just about the doctor, but the team behind it. Interplast works for Dr Theerapong too, but I had communication problems with them, and aftercare hasn&#39;t been talked about with Interplast.
</li>
<li>
My recovery has been good so far, thanks to Siam Transformation. The first week has been tough. I had to sleep on my back all the time (I can turn to the side but it was painful). I got morphine, but I vomit every time I get it. They added anti-nausea to the medication and it went a bit better. I broke down for a few hours after around 2 days postop, but Siam Transformation and my boyfriend has been with me through video call during that time. it was around 3 in the night. there was also someone with me 24/7 during my entire hospital stay, so I wasn&#39;t alone :D They removed the packing on the first of december. I had hair on my bikini area so it hurted. I actually pooped twice before they have removed the packing, catheter, and drainage. I peed right after they removed the catheter too, so I guess everything was in order. I went to the bathroom and peed once more. I felt like I was gonna pass out, but Cherry made me smell something so that I don&#39;t lose consciousness. The first week of dilation has been quite ok. I have blister on the lower right side of my inner labia, so it was a bit painful. Right now, I only take painkillers before going to bed (Tramadol) and before dilation (Paracetamol).
</li>
<li>
I am very sensitive in the clit (not in a sexual way yet), and I can feel my labia too.  I got what I wanted in terms of aesthetics. I requested that I didn&#39;t want anything that resembles something I had down there before the surgery (some labias look like a very slim version of penis and it triggers my dysphoria), and I can&#39;t really see the wrong parts. I am still swollen tho, but I think it&#39;ll get better. Definitely satisfied so far :D No plans for any revisions so far. i asked my cis-female friends and they actually commented that it already looks like a vagina even if it&#39;s swollen. I didn&#39;t get the surgery to get a pornstar pussy (Still, I just wanted to have a vagina and everyone&#39;s vagina is different).
</li>
<li>
lubrication is a bit too much atm, but it has been both blood and discharge. when I dilated yesterday, there was a lot less blood. I find the peritoneal lubrication to be quite sticky. I haven&#39;t tried to insert my finger in it (it&#39;s not time for it yet), but I can hear the sounds of my wet vajayjay and I&#39;m loving it. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s enough for sex without lube, but the first few times will be with lube, just to be safe.
</li>
</ol>

I hope I have answered all your questions. Please let me know if I forgot to answer anything and just comment here if you have more questions

Thanks üôà Cherry Said that the gray parts were bruising btw.

<p>
I&#39;m not expecting that it looks good already (too swollen for my preference)

If someone wonders, I got PPV. First two inches were made of scrotal skin, and the rest were peritoneum.
</p>
<p>
I got in contact with Siam Transformation for the whole package (including aftercare):

My nurse told me that I have a blister on my labia. (and the first dilation hurted like if I were virgin).  She used saline solution with betadine to clean it btw, so it might affect the color as well.

Yeah! The Black part on my inner labia starts to decrease. I&#39;m on my dilation session with my nurse right now btw, and you can notice here that left labia is really starting to improve. Here&#39;s the pic:

Dr. Thee promised 6 - 7 inches. I got 7 inches üòÑ
</p>
<p>
I recommend contacting Siam Transformative if you are considering them. They have both website and Facebook page. They practically helped me with all things I need üòÑ

Ah, I see. I had PPV btw. (mainly because I don&#39;t want them to cut a part of my colon, and PPV provides lubrication)

My BMI is almost 28, and they operated on me. A lot of the surgeons only do Colon Vaginoplasty on people with BMI of less than 25. Not so sure.. Colon is good for depth btw
