Hi all… I’m looking for a good surgeon here in the USA and so far it seems she is possibly “The One”.  I’m hoping to see if there are any of you here that can vouch for her and have results we can take a look.  I have a friend of mine that we might be getting it done at the same time…. Any help would be great.
</p>

My result from McGinn is on the low end of her results that I’ve seen, so I do kinda wish I’d gone to someone like Dr. BBL, personally. Having said that, I think it does still look better than many I see posted here. I’ll be getting a revision with her hopefully within the next year

That’s awesome.  I’m happy for you.  My concerns are that it looks like a cis one… but that is also usable.  How’s your depth?

I wouldn’t say mine looks cis, but hopefully the revision will get it close enough. Depth is fine; 6.5inches at my last check in. Though as I’ve been dilating less, I can tell I’ve lost some. Still fine, but I can tell it’s less

After surgery with BBL, I had about 8” on day one of dilation but due to my own neglect (including time for travel, etc) I lost some depth. I believe I’m gaining some of what I lost back, but honestly… I haven’t been with a guy for 10 years and kind of over with relationships so I’m fine with what I have. The new toys don’t complain. LOL.

Every result I’ve seen looks really great. Plus she does a robot assisted partial/hybrid peritoneal graft. I’ve also had a friend go to her with great results, 8in of depth, and dilating has been super easy for her

Just about five months post-op with McGinn here.  Fantastic experience overall despite a couple small initial complications.  Results look good and everything is functional...  If you have any specific questions, let me know.

Sure... had a hematoma in the labia immediately after surgery that was super scary.  McGinn has seen everything and was a total pro, did what needed to be done immediately in her office during the week following surgery.  It&#39;s healed really well--in fact, you would never know the complication happened.  McGinn and her entire team are fantastic to deal with.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics, depth and functionality are good.  I was able to verify &#34;full&#34; functionality around 6 weeks post-op and can say I wasn&#39;t remotely prepared for how much &#34;better&#34; the post-op experience was in that regard.  Like, just wow.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, best of luck with everything regardless of which surgeon you choose.  Do your consults and make sure you feel a good connection.

Will share that I underwent concurrent Chondrolaryngoplasty and BA with her this past July, (am currently working on a very detailed post w/pics) and am
<strong>
<em>
over the moon-happy
</em>
</strong>
with the results❣️
</p>
<p>
The only issue I had with the whole surgery process at Capital Health the day of surgery was in pre-op, where I had a male nurse who kept using male pronouns. It pissed me off. After all, I was there for breast augmentation, for Christ’s sakes!
</p>
<p>
I stopped him by telling him I can’t help that the record he was looking at listed me as Male but I am working on it. I corrected him on my gender, sexual orientation and pronouns. He then called a time-out, left the room and Debbie, the woman I communicated with for paying the hospital fee was called in. I didn’t know it was her at the time, however I could hear her having a quiet, stern conversation with the nurse in the hall. She came in, shut the door, introduced herself and apologized for the nurse, then made sure I, and my wife were okay. Turns out, she is one hell-of-a advocate for Dr. McGinn’ patients and she was like a mother bear protecting her cubs on the guy. She spent about 15-minutes with us, and for me, instantly became another one of my Earthbound Angels that day. When the nurse came back in the room to finish the prep, he was respectful and there were no more issues.

I don&#39;t have personal experience with McGinn, but I know that her requirements for letters are way more than most surgeons. For example, she wants to know about any relapse or &#34;purging&#34; episodes.

I think they mean that in an illicit drug use sort of fashion.
</p>
<p>
For example, our prep packet requires you don&#39;t use nicotine one month prior and one year post op. Not necessarily a hard drug, but it heavily impacts recovery

&#34;Purge&#34; is a word McGinn uses, and when I see it, it makes me think that she is thinking of the old Harry Benjamin scale that was in use, in which he puts transfems on a scale from transvestism to transsexualism. In particular, of transvestites he says:
</p>
<p>
Heterosexual, except when dressed. Dressing gives sexual satisfaction with relief of gender discomfort. May purge and relapse.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Purge&#34; in this case means throwing out all of your clothes (or whatever) in a fit of shame.
</p>
<p>
So I get the sense that McGinn can be somewhat of a gatekeeper despite the quality of her work.

Very interesting.  I have to say I’ve never heard of this but have heard that she goes a bit over board on the documents before the surgery.  I mean I guess you can take it as “she absolutely wants to make sure” or like you said, a gatekeeper.  Having regret after a surgery like that can be devastating for a person and having that in your conscious can be detrimental as well…

A little under 6 months post op for me.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s super pretty and quite functional.  She may not have a stellar bedside manner but she knows what she&#39;s talking about and if you can handle a no nonsense straight talker, you&#39;ll be going to a highly competent surgeon who genuinely cares about the outcomes of her patients.
</p>
<p>
The Gaia recovery house is beautiful and super convenient, her team is highly experienced, and her administrative side works like a charm (even if some of the paperwork is... outdated).
</p>
<p>
IMO, she&#39;s a badass, and I&#39;d pick her 10 times out of 10.

I concur with your comments about her bedside manner, Admin, GAIA Guest House, etc. As to her manner, I’m USN Retired and she is former USN Flight Surgeon so I’m used to her type mannerisms. She is direct, cut-to-the-chase, drop-the-BS, which, to some may come across as brusque.
</p>
<p>
She can have a wicked sense of humor. This past July while in pre-op for concurrent BA and TS with her, she and Kristal (her PA) stopped in and asked if I had questions. I asked her about requirements for not speaking post-op and how would I be able to communicate in post-op if I was not supposed to use my voice? She shook her head, said that was BS, and that I was only to refrain from whispering. She then looked at my wife and said,
<strong>
<em>
“I can write you a prescription for her not to talk, how long do you want to keep her quiet?”
</em>
</strong>
Good times!
</p>

Oh yeah, McGinn&#39;s Navy background is a good portion of why I chose her.  I

hate
</em>
going under for surgery.  That complete loss of control scares the hell out of me, but knowing someone as competent as McGinn would be leading the OR eased my nerves.

<p>
Kristal is amazing!  I&#39;ll be back to see her in a couple weeks for a granulation tissue related follow up.  The Papillon staff impressed me the whole way through.

Recovery been good enough, feel basically 100% now.

Dilation sucks but ya do what ya gotta do.  I was pretty aggressive about scaling down, but of course I&#39;d recommend doing what your doc says.

I’m curious on how you managed the pain, did you take like Motrin or something?  I work from home so taking time to dilate won’t be an issue for me but pain management is another area of concern.

Fuck that, I used every tab of Vicodin they gave me.  Maybe didn&#39;t need it, but I figure I&#39;m having one of the most sensitive areas on my body turned literally inside out.  If there&#39;s ever a use case for opiate painkillers, this is it.

Tylenol was plenty after 2.5 weeks or so

I’ve heard a few negative comments about McGinn, but they were never directly from someone that had gone to her. Such as her work is less than stellar. I scratched her name off the list since she was out of my insurance’s network. I was told I could pay out of pocket up front, and the insurance company would reimburse me. Sure… I didn’t want to pay that game. Dr BLL was highly recommended, she is in the network, and is part of a highly respected medical center, NYU. One thing with McGinn that sounded nice was they have a recovery place in which you stay for a couple of weeks, and they visit you there. I wasn’t familiar with NYC, so it was a little nerve wrecking getting around. I found a hotel that was within 15 minutes of the hospital, right down the street from the Times Square, and plenty of places to eat, etc. Once in place, and becoming familiar with the area, it was a pretty decent stay, aside from the NYC traffic, people, etc. The worst part was really the smells and the amount of trash, both litter and trash bags on the sidewalks.

Oh yes, I’m completely pleased with the results. 😁 My vah jay jay looks great and the orgasms are delightful. I’ve been using the orange dilator, which is the biggest at 1.5” diameter, and the green one which helps maintain the depth. Day 1 of dilation I was getting around 8” of depth. I’ve lost a bit of that due to my own neglect and time (travel, work, etc) to dilate. But I feel I’m regaining a little over time. Dr Bluebond-Langner is pretty insistent on exploring yourself and masturbating, it definitely helps to connect with the new genitalia and your mind. I imagine that is a typical suggestion from any doctor. Good luck in your decision and surgery!

I&#39;m 6 months post-op, very happy with my experience.  I&#39;ve posted here before about it, so check my post history.  I also run a (small, private) server of post-op McGinn patients, a couple of whom have commented in this thread.  A couple have had issues like hematomas or dehiscence, which were expertly dealt with by McGinn and her staff.  Most of us had no significant issues, and everyone is doing well and extremely happy with their choice of surgeon.

First of all, your comments mark you as very uninformed about Dr. McGinn, meaning you are not speaking from personal experiences. One will be hard pressed to find actual disparaging remarks about her work. While everyone is entitled to opinion, please base yours on what you actually know. Trash-talking a world-renowned surgeon without personal experience is frowned on here.
