I had MTF bottom surgery with Sidhbh Gallagher MD. Running the IU GAS program in Indianapolis. It&#39;s surgery. Shit happens you will never see coming.  I&#39;m an experienced surgery patient and even I was blindsided by the scale of unexpected twists and turns. So much so, except for a brief overview of my first few days, this part of my recovery experience starts with my revision surgery -- 7 months in. Ask away.

I bought this up to date for anyone paying attention that wants to see a story that should probably be titled: When GCS Goes Bad
</p>
<p>
This has been my experience through the first 15 months. Have I changed my mind about my surgeon? Hell yes. I gave her every benefit of the doubt that this would turn out alright and ended up with a wreck. It&#39;s been like a cruel joke at my expense the entire time.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve laid it all out so this doesn&#39;t happen to you when you place your trust in a surgeon for GCS. I made the mistake of trying to stay local and making it a priority over traveling to a proven surgeon with deep experience. I&#39;ve paid a pretty high price for that error. Who you choose to do your surgery fucking matters. Big time.
</p>
<p>
For the record, I retract any recommendation I&#39;ve made about MTF bottom surgery with Dr. S. Gallagher in Indianapolis. No Can Do! This has nothing to do with FTM top surgery, I&#39;ll leave those comments to other voices.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know why it&#39;s all right here. Well, most of it anyway.

I like how you used Google Photos instead of Imgur. I&#39;ll have to start doing that myself.

It works surprisingly well and you can chain albums together as story segments. It&#39;s certainly limited in its text formatting and layout, but ya, overall, it works.

Sorry to hear you&#39;ve had those problems, but that&#39;s an excellent write up. However I&#39;m unclear at the end of reading it if you would recommend her as a surgeon?

I have to be completely honest here and retract what I wrote below about recommending this surgeon. I can&#39;t do it. I meant what I said when I said it, but I was making assumptions that somehow everything would come together when the truth is they did not. This is obvious in my updated June, 23rd post and people here all wouldn&#39;t think much of my judgment if I tried to make the case think this was a good result. I have continued to document the healing for the last 15 months.
</p>
<p>
I walked away from Dr. Gallagher&#39;s care at the end of February mainly because her of condescending coordinator who made me feel unwelcome, but at the same time, I didn&#39;t appreciate Dr. Gallagher trying to convince me that I had a good result during my appointment right after I had complained about the scarring, the asymmetry and how she folded everything into my Vulva during the revision. That was never ever the plan! On top of that, after 11 months of aftercare appointments, devastating depression, and a revision surgery, I simply couldn&#39;t afford it anymore. Hell, I had to borrow money to buy food at that point. Anyway, I don&#39;t want to be responsible for anyone who decides to have MTF bottom surgery with her because I regret that decision. You&#39;ll need to find someone else who has had a better experience than I did for that information.
</p>
<p>
------------Original Post below---------------
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a very valid question and the answer is yes. I would and still do recommend her. I can separate and recognize my experience as an outlier regardless of the difficulties. I&#39;ve met some of her other post-op patients and none of them shared a similar experience in terms of complications and seemed happy with their result.  Of course, I&#39;m not happy with the way parts of my recovery unraveled.  I  would imagine that&#39;s pretty clear by some of my comments. I did a lot of documenting over the last 10 months. I can identify to the day some of the decisions where we zigged instead of zagged. No doubt changes have been made in both protocols and patient documentation to improve the entire experience because of them.
</p>
<p>
We need the availability of this practice and others connected to it in the Midwest. The reality of any new GRS practice surgeon or practice is she didn&#39;t have the luxury of starting with the experience of 200 MTF bottom surgeries under her scrubs. None of the well-known GRS surgeons did. I just keep telling myself that 6 months from now, I won&#39;t give a shit about all these downside issues plus I&#39;ll have a great outcome to show for it. Still feels very doable to me. You&#39;re welcome to follow along.

My pleasure. I&#39;ll keep adding more documentation and updates at least once a week for a while. Plus, I was thinking about adding more detailed documentation about the specific complications prior to the revision because they happen to a lot of GCS patients. Even though teens, 20 and 30 somethings have fewer issues on average and recover faster, I&#39;ve have been completely surprised by how many post-ops dislike discussing their problematic issues out of embarrassment or a desire to protect the name of their surgeon.
</p>
<p>
This is bad policy for everyone. In most cases, we&#39;ve have spent years, even decades contemplating and discussing this needs and nature of this surgery with a certain aesthetic in mind. When it&#39;s over we should be able to offer a well-reasoned opinion of the outcome and whether it&#39;s met our expectations and what it took to get there. It doesn&#39;t need to sound like you&#39;re lashing out at them -unless they deserve it of course.

Hi Emma, apologies on commenting on this post that&#39;s 4 years old but I think it&#39;s the best place to write this.
</p>
<p>
What you went through was horrific and i don&#39;t think I could have managed it if I&#39;m honest. I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to write it up in an accessible way and being honest about your mistreatment and very poor surgeon. I&#39;m glad you have finally had successful revisions and it looks a lot better now x
</p>
<p>
Your experience puts my issues into perspective and I thank you for that, it has helped me make better decisions regarding my result. I was really not happy with my treatment in hospital and just tried to forget it but when I approached the surgeon at 2 months and asked about the scarring and huge labia that I didn&#39;t like at all he basically made me feel stupid for complaining. His exact words were &#39;well that&#39;s what you got&#39;. I didn&#39;t want a repeat of the pain, his verbal, mental and physical abuse so I wrote a lengthy complaint to the hospital. I made it clear that I never wanted him near me again and your experience reinforces my beleive that it was the right decision. They have offered me an appointment with a different surgeon that I have already met and I&#39;m (definitely not looking forward to going to hospital but) hoping she can fix my issues.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again, you posts have not got anywhere near enough attention.
</p>
<p>
Big hug from me x
