<p>
As the title states, on March 7, 2022 I had a simple bilateral orchiectomy with Dr Aaron Grotas at Mt Sinai, NYC.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Why I chose him and Insurance Approval
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr Grotas because I am already in Mt Sinai&#39;s transgender clinic and he is their urologist for orchiectomy&#39;s. Additionally, my insurance (Aetna) approved him. I had problems with approval with my last insurance with him but Aetna PPO approved quickly and first try!
</p>
<p>
Approval involved an in-person visit with him, letter of support from PCP and social worker (previously mental health professional too I believe but not any longer) and then was scheduled for a month out pending insurance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Consult
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the consult he was kind but kinda eccentric. He is outspoken about his world geo-political and economic views but whatever. Urged me towards simple not radical (inguinal) orchiectomy, and to keep scrotal tissue which I didn&#39;t really care too much about and was probably the right call. Never any bad vibes, just eccentric and busy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Leading up to surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Leading up to surgery was scary even though simple orchis aren&#39;t too bad of a recovery according to most people. Labs and covid test 5 days before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day of surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Day of in the changing room he met with me and was relaxed. Mostly talked about life and stuff. Sounds like he does a lot of surgeries back to back on his surgery days - slightly worrying but that&#39;s normal I think.
</p>
<p>
Nurses were great, got on operating table, knocked out with general anesthesia. Woke up in recovery crying from happiness lol. Went home at 4pm (surgery was at 1:30 I think?), mom picked me up outside due to covid restrictions.
</p>

<p>
Fear not! This is apparently what they write for all orchis like this - had a few scary minutes in post-surgical recovery thinking I had fake balls put in
</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>
Complications
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Minimal but more than other&#39;s I&#39;ve seen. Dehiscence where the scrotum tore during surgery on day 9 that caused lots multi-day bleeding. And the long-term presence of hard tissue (fat / muscle left behind according to the doc) behind the hematoma / dehiscence that is slowly dissolving. Would love if someone could tell me what that is, I&#39;ve heard other&#39;s have had it too with similar surgeries and it just takes time to dissolve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery Timeline
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Stayed in hotel 1 night, pain started that night. Mostly slept. Limited mobility that night and next day. Pain got worse the next morning but nothing unbearable ever. Definitely there but manageable. Just used OTC 400mg tylenol I believe. Should have iced more that first day but the gauze and compression underwear they give you prevented it from doing anything.
</p>
<p>
Here are

in an album, they will be shared by day below
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/mqeS1qQ">Day 1
</a>
</p>
<p>
Woke up, moved very slowly to bathroom to shower and get ready to be driven home. Removed surgical gauze, and was horrified to see a second incision?? Later found out it was likely due to tearing not and incision, although Dr. Grotas couldn&#39;t seem to remember when I asked him 2.5 weeks after. No notes about it in the post operative report. Other than that pretty severe swelling and bruising, kept icing and sat on donut pillow. Sweatpants and post-partum panties / period panties saved my life.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/O9WRDhP">Day 2
</a>
</p>
<p>
Back home, walking carefully, mostly in bed. More swelling and bruising. Bruising ascended penis and began in perinium / rectum area. Looking like frankenstein. Feeling like I still have balls, but bigger
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/e4K7oLs">Day 3
</a>
</p>
<p>
So bruised, less swelling. Back to work from home
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/GKW2cap">Day 4
</a>
</p>
<p>
Significant improvement on my left side in swelling and bruising. Inguinal / bladder area bruising from the pulling of the cord (i think). Definitely a hematoma on my right side where the skin / muscle tore (?).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/kEysfUy">Day 5
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/z5yGvif">Day 6
</a>
</p>
<p>
Masturbated very carefully with a vibrator. Felt amazingggg especially knowing I had nothing down there to produce anything. Orgasm felt more feminine but who knows. Still some clear fluid from cowpers / prostate, that&#39;s all i had before though (T fully suppressed on injections for a while, no AAs)
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/Ys95SdN">Day 7
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/hJsXHWS">Day 8
</a>
</p>
<p>
Still no heavy lifting but definitely pretty active (driving places, walking around the house, doing light chores than don&#39;t have lifting or bending over. Sitting on a donut pillow when on hard surfaces. Definitely still being very careful
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/CyEHHHb">Day 9
</a>
</p>
<p>
Tragedy struck. The rightside stitches opened up and began pouring blood. Bed sheets underwear and gauze pads were soaked. Everytime I get the bleeding stopped it start again later, just seeping out dark blood. If i squeeze the scrotum lots more comes out. It seems the blood coming out might be reducing the hematoma?? That seems unlikely but thats what it feels like
</p>
<p>
Starting to enjoy the shape of my lower half more, less bulky!
</p>
<p>
Said fuck it and went for a walk in the woods and snow. Probably not wise but I&#39;m getting tired of not being outside. Couldn&#39;t slipped and tore things open more, don&#39;t do this. I didn&#39;t tolerate it very well and came back after 45 min.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/IymzXue">Day 10
</a>
</p>
<p>
Find out why the wound is gushing blood - it has totally opened up from the stitches failing. I now have a big gap where the skin should be closed that goes very deep. Not sure how deep. Not sure if I should be in the ER or worried about infection. I assume this is a dehiscence.
</p>
<p>
Much less swelling though!
</p>
<p>
First really good shower. (I had many others, but I got the scrotum cleaned a lot more).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/SvTHNGj">Day 11
</a>
</p>
<p>
Steri-strips to the rescue! Much less bleeding with the strips holding things together. Later find out this might not be a good idea, still not sure. But it worked for me. Made sure to wash / disinfect / clean out the wound thoroughly before application.
</p>
<p>
Cooked dinner and tried on dresses to see if I don&#39;t need to tuck anymore - results inconclusive at that point lol
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/px3rb9o">Day 14
</a>
</p>
<p>
Looking a lot better! Did some heavy lifting (cinderblock and 5 gal buckets of water) for the first time since surgery - definitely overdid it, but got lucky and didn&#39;t mess anything up. Just more bleeding from the dehiscence and pain.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/A9YwAh9">Day 16
</a>
</p>
<p>
I (not wisely) removed the main incisions stitches and scabs. No complications.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/ESouUGt">Day 17
</a>
</p>
<p>
My dehiscence is puss-ey but smells fine and feels fine. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s infected. It appears to be granulating in well
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/euVt8IB">Day 19
</a>
</p>
<p>
Much more independent with heavy things, went on a date and didn&#39;t have to behave / move weirdly due to wounds.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/NRxWM5e">Day 23
</a>
</p>
<p>
Pretty much back to normal, still being careful, the hematoma is long gone but there is still hard sometimes tender tissue remaining on the right side that shouldn&#39;t be there and is slowly going away. That will probably take a few weeks - months to fully dissolve.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/ahOibyS">Day 30
</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/ChSLcuE">Day 43 (today)
</a>
</p>
<p>
Feeling good. Definitely still have to be careful how I handle the area, but am able to touch it and feel it safely and am basically doing everything normally. Much less hard tissue remaining, but still quite a bit, maybe half what was there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
General Thoughts
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Glad I did it, but it was more of a recovery than I expected after having seen other people&#39;s super quick recovery. I had lots of bruising and swelling, dehiscence, and long term hard swelling/tissue left behind. Overall, Dr Grotas is good, not amazing imo, but then again surgery and healing is complicated and a good surgeon can have complications. Wasn&#39;t thrilled with the level of attention he gave me but he was available when I asked. Tucking is way easier, but will get even more so as the hard tissue dissolves. That alone is worth it
</p>
<p>
I already was off spiro / AA, so this was really more cosmetic than anything else lol. Overall glad I did it. A little scared for future surgeries given how prone to bruising and swelling I was. Not sure if that&#39;s a valid fear
</p>

<strong>
Cost
</strong>
Don&#39;t have all the info on hand at the moment, I believe the hospital billed $8,000 roughly, insurance paid around $1,500, and I had a cost of $1750.67 :(
</p>
<p>
Will update with real numbers when I can
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I was billed $17,206. Insurance paid $8072. I had to pay $1869. Dunno how i got the numbers so wrong lol

I had an orchi w Dr G in Jan 2020. Loved every bit of the experience, he was great and I healed up well. I&#39;ve since had a vaginoplasty w Dr Avanessian. No regrets. Sinai is great.
