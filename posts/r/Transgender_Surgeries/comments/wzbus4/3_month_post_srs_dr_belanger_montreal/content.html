Not sure how I feel about it other than that it&#39;s been an emotionally &amp; at times physically exhausting 3 months. Would I do it again? Absolutely. Was recovery &amp; the whole experience tougher than I thought it would be? ABSOLUTELY.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately I may have to go back for a revision. As you can see my clitoris is off center which bugs me. I also struggle with dilating. like I am down to 2 sessions a day but each of them take about an hour because I&#39;m way too tight to just do the 5 mins with #3 &amp; 25 mins with #4 right away as they suggest.. still have discharge too.
</p>
<p>
Any thoughts &amp; questions are welcome

Belanger did mine back in March and I&#39;m def hoping for a revision (s2g my clit healed basically inside of me) - but not sure I trust anyone there to touch me again.
</p>
<p>
Looks great though.

I know what you mean. The thought of being operated on there &amp; having to go through it all again is terrifying/exhausting and I&#39;m not even sure the revision would be covered. If not I may have to make due with what I have..

Yeah, I&#39;m desperately hoping my Gyno might be able to help (she&#39;s one a team who can and does do minor revision surgeries so I don&#39;t have to go back to montreal) but we&#39;ll see
</p>
<p>
I hope you can find a way to get your revision. It&#39;s an annoying disappointment to have to learn to live with.

Did you expect the clit and the clitoral hood to be prominently visible on the exterior, and did you ask for it with photo reference.
</p>
<p>
Women with a concealed Clitoris can more easily discover and enjoy another perk to self pleasure benefits
</p>
<p>
While out’y faces difficulty if they don’t have thick thighs &amp; prone to unwelcome clothing textures
</p>
<p>
Not sure about you but I love being able to use my puffy vulva to stimulate my clit as I drop my silk night gown shoulder strap to start using my free hand(s) to stimulate my tits
</p>
<p>
Unless you would rather have to sacrifice one hand for an out’y

I&#39;m at entering the 5th month. My dilation exactly is the same as yours. Got difficult from month 4 and really rakes time to insert. And a lot of yellow/green discharge. I&#39;ve had hypergranulation and I think still I have more inside as my underpad gets bloody by dilation. They said someone should examine me but no doctor here is accepting me. Also the nurse said discharge is not a problem and will disappear when repair is complete

These aesthetics are easy to replicate, but ask for labia minora, clitoral hood, and fourchette and see.

yes! I did have my mom and dad rotating taking care/staying with me everyday for the first month. I don&#39;t think it would be possible doing it alone as with the dilating, douching, showers, sitz baths &amp; air drying it equated to about 8 hours a day. so it was great having someone to cook meals, get groceries, clean etc. emotionally I coped by listening to a lot of music &amp; reading. Tried to meditate and vocalize positive reaffirmations to myself on the tough days. I had 2 (separate) scares since my return home where I was bleeding for a few days and not knowing why so it really helped not being completely alone.

Love it! I’m seven weeks post Brassard and look much the same but labia minora are still kind of rock hard and mostly insensate. They were VERY swollen for quite a while and I assume will eventually get with the program. Clitoris seems to be way down in there, it’s all supposed to take a long time so I am being patient and trying not to get anxious.
</p>
<p>
I gave up on Thor (#4) and do only 2 and 3, as I have a very sore spot just inside and even #3 was quite painful for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I like the way you look and hope to do that well. Best wishes.

I was feeling sensation there around 2 months I started to orgasm. I don&#39;t think my clit is hidden per say, I just wish it wasn&#39;t off to the side. I hope things get easier for you

We&#39;re you able to talk to her about what you want from your surgery in terms of specific details? I&#39;m going with dr. Belanger (not much choice in Canada, &amp; she has a woman&#39;s touch I feel), but I really want a more pronounced labia minora with lips that stick out a bit.
</p>
<p>
No one I&#39;ve asked has been able to answer this. Or would it need to be a revision? I&#39;d prefer to get it all done at once since I&#39;m not sure where the extra tissue will come from for the revision. Thanks :)

to be honest the consultation I had with her the morning of was very brief. she just asked how I was feeling and if I was ready and that was about it. I haven&#39;t heard of anyone being able to customize it per say, but there&#39;s no harm in mentioning it before you go in the operating room

I was told I&#39;d be able to have a consultation with her once my application was accepted. I&#39;m hoping to talk to a nurse about it, just to see if it&#39;s possible since they&#39;re more available. I just... Really want   pronounced labia minora and grs Montreal is my only option unless I want to wait ~5 years, but they&#39;re not the most forthcoming with answers :/ I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s possible with a revision, since that seems to focus on everything except the labia minora lol

Late response but I am going with Kavanagh and Genoway in BC and PPT method- they seem a bit more lenient in terms of &#34;customization&#34;. They seemed open to helping me get the result I want even if I had to push quite hard to get PPT.

Can I ask you when a lot of the swelling started to subside? I’m actually a little over 2 months post op with dr Belanger as well and I’m still pretty swollen towards the top. Our results seem to be quite similar though! I understand everyone has their preferences/concerns but if this is what I have to look forward to in a months I gotta say I’m pretty happy about it.
