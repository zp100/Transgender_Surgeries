Hello,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a MTF trans woman who underwent surgery a year and a half ago and experienced immediate urinary complications. Has anyone experienced a stricture or / narrowing of their urethra after MTF bottom surgery?
</p>

Thanks for responding. I&#39;ve been seeing a urologist now to help me try and identify the problem. He was able to insert a cystoscope in me twice and he did not find any sort of narrowing all the way up to my bladder.  But at times it feels tight and sometimes I  would insert a 14 FR catheter to
<em>
&#34;air it out,&#34;
</em>
and then I can feel sensation and urinate. He thinks it has to do with my pelvic floor muscles tightening and not relaxing. This whole peeing experience is such a major adjustment and I need to retrain myself with my new anatomy. It gets frustrating.

To start off I&#39;m a small girl. Everything about me is small including my vaginal canal, so dilation is quite painful and tight even when I&#39;m relaxing my muscles. Even my doctor who did my SRS said that operating on me was like operating on a small girl. He even mentioned that my urethra was small to begin with. Do you think if I&#39;m not dilating enough that it effects how I pee?

Are you getting surgery to get your urethra opening bigger? Could I ask who your doctor is and where are you getting it done?

yeah i&#39;m getting surgery to make my urethra opening bigger as the opening is quite tight. i&#39;m getting it done at Parkside Hospital in the UK with Tina Rashid doing the surgery who originally did my first surgery too.
