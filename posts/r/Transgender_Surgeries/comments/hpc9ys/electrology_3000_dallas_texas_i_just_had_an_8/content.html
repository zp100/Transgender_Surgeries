<p>
So...I just had my 3rd session of electrolysis on my face.  I walk in knowing that its going to be 8 hours of grueling pain and uncomfort.  The first time, you are excited to start.  After that you basically dread it.  Although, you walk out after 8 hours extremely happy that you did it and its over.
</p>
<p>
My face hasn&#39;t shown much of a difference in the amount of hair at this point.  Although, I will say that it looks clear and pretty in between appointments.  I typically go for two days.  The first days is a full clearing on my face.  The 2nd day is a full clearing for GCS preparation followed by a facial and laser on my body.
</p>
<p>
I am still in the closet and look male but things are starting to change.  One thing that should also be noted (it has been mentioned before), it seemed as if I had more visible hair on my third clearing.  The ladies asked if I was on hormones and I said yes.  Their response was that hormones make smaller hairs.  This was very true in my case.  I totally noticed it before I walked in the door but it didn&#39;t register until she told me.  If you can do electrolysis before starting hormones, it might save you time and money.  The smaller hairs take longer to clear because they are harder to obtain for the electrolysis professional. Just some food for thought for those ladies who have the patience to wait.
</p>
<p>
A couple of other things to note:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Sitting in the chair for 8 hours is very uncomfortable.  You don&#39;t want to move while they are working.  Try and take a 2 minute break every hour and just bend over and stretch.
<br>
</li>
<li>
Remind them to do your ears if you have a little growth there...they are human and forget sometimes.
<br>
</li>
<li>
You will need 3 or 4 days to recover.  I typically go on a Thursday so I have at least 3 full days for the swelling to go down.
<br>
</li>
<li>
If you are planning to go soon, buy a bandana or a hunting/fishing face cover.  They are totally acceptable during the Covid days.  They cover your face as well as your swollen neck.  It makes it easier to get around without attention.
</li>
<li>
Drink lots of water.
<br>
</li>
<li>
They put a lot of heat into your face so bring some cheap ice packs.  Fill them up at the hotel and ice down each area for 10-15 minutes when you get back to your room.  I watch TV and do this on and off for an hour and then again for another hour later in the evening.
</li>
</ol>

Yeah, me too. My technician does around my whole ear because I have these weirdly long hairs that grow at random all I&#39;ve my ears. So much happier with them gone!

I thought they did lidocaine injections to numb your face.

They do.  The shots are painful but after that you do not feel anything until they move to the next area.  They can also get outside the area that is numb.  It will make you move or jerk around a bit and they will stop and numb the new area in which they are moving to.

They do inject lidocaine which help. On the upper lip I ask for the &#34; dental block&#34; less swelling on the upper lip as well as less bruises.

You can choose that or cream at most locations, i’ve done with and without cream while doing 32 hairs at a time thanks to the process used by my electrologist. Will say it is painful either way, injections might be the way to go for full numbing affect especially for those long sessions

I just want to say that I&#39;ve been here twice to get electrolysis for my bottom surgery and have nothing but negative things to say about them. I gave them a chart from my doctor and at my first appointment, they left a massive patch (that my chart specifically said to do) completely untouched. At my next appointment my electrologist couldnt be bothered to find my fucking chart (that was literally on their desk) and instead of asking me for one or for what doctor I&#39;m seeing, they just assumed what I wanted and spent more than double the time that I should&#39;ve spent there on areas that I didn&#39;t need or want done, and then had the fucking audacity to blame me for not giving them another copy of the chart that they already fucking had. On top of that they missed the exact same area as the first lady, and when I told them they missed it they adamantly denied it. And ON TOP of that, while i was butt ass naked, crying from the pain and dysphoria, another lady who worked there just opened up the fucking door without even knocking, for the world to see my nasty ass genitals and acted like it was nothing. I spent $300 for this incompetent asshole to traumatize me for things that were completely unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend literally any other company to this one, like holy shit. This would already have been incredibly traumatizing if it had gone well, but these have been the worst experiences of my life, like far more traumatizing than when I was sexually assaulted.

Oh my god. That sounds horrible. Who was was working on you?
</p>
<p>
I have had people walk in on me too. It was very uncomfortable. I am the type of person that doesn’t complain. I hear you though. I came there because they are known in the trans community and I did not want to feel awkward during this transition time period. In other words, I relish my privacy.
</p>
<p>
I kind of feel like they have the market cornered. I cannot get the type beard removal like this anywhere in my area of Texas except for electrology 3000.  I do continually coach them on certain areas that I want done and they seem to comply but not all the time.
</p>
<p>
They are far from perfect but I’m going to stick with them. I have developed a relationship with my technicians. However, they can definitely improve their business.
</p>
<p>
Do you have recommendations on any other businesses that offer this service? I’m curious to see if they have any competition. It might force them to improve on some areas.

Thanks for the insight. Been looking at this place.
</p>
<p>
Was there a wait list?
</p>
<p>
Besides speed do you think it&#39;s more economical than the traditional 100+ visits to a local electrolysis?

There is not much of a wait list if you plan and book multiple appointments in the future so you have a spot reserved.
</p>
<p>
I do not about the economics other than its expensive either way.  Its the convenience that is most beneficial.  You get in and get it done and move on for 6 weeks until the next appointment.

My local place is not cheap, but is less per hour per tech, especially once you include the cost of injections, hotel, possible flights, etc.
</p>
<p>
Places like 3000, though, work faster due to the high setting, and probably have the latest equipment and highly experienced techs.  That might make up for the higher cost.

I waited 6 weeks to get on a list. But then you are in the &#34;rotation&#34;. Some people&#39;s pocketbooks can&#39;t afford the big upfront cost. But I do believe the every 6 weeks/ 8 weeks rotation is the best. And the most cost effective way. Death from a 1000 needles is sucky. With numbing more gooder 🤣🤣🤣. I actually laugh during my sessions. Which is way better than crying.

I just love Denise and Sabrina. The whole staff are sooo sweet. Especially to us Trans peeps. Echinacea is a good way to bring down the swelling. I feel so fortunate that they are literally 3 blocks away.

You can get rid of swelling with prednisone, but you’ll need a prescription.

I actually have some prednisone from some bad allergies.  I didnt even think about it until you mentioned it.  Good idea!  I will wait though...prednisone is not good to take if you contract Covid.  My face is semi normal after a couple of days.  Its a great time to get your electrolysis done with all the mask wearing that&#39;s taking place.  I get embarrassed easily so face masks helps.

No I have not but I would love to know.  I actually asked the ladies at E3000 and they told me that there would be no scaring.  So far my face has looked pretty smooth after a week or two.  I would like to know myself as it has concerned me.

My skin care people refuse to do more than 45 min sessions with me.  I do have extremely sensitive skin, and i am glad that they are concerned about this.  I have not much to be removed to start with.  I need to do a really good shaving once a week, and I might  stick with that.  One of my cis girlfriends has at least as much facial hair as I do.

Is there any particular reason you don&#39;t/can&#39;t take a sleeping pill for the duration?

I don’t think that would be a good idea. They are giving you shots of lidocaine that makes you a little jumpy. Having a sleeping pill on top of all of that might drop your heart rate or something. I don’t think the lidocaine is dangerous but adding additional drugs to the whole mix is probably not good. You won’t be able to sleep through anyway.  In addition to the pain, they do give you instructions and have you move your head quite a bit.

You’ll need a doctors prescribe for it so you’d find out if it’s safe then. I’ve done as it helps relax and stress increases pain, and they are not strong enough to force me to sleep if I don’t want to. You do need to find one that won’t last longer than the electrolysis session or you’re going to have problems afterwards, and you probably can’t drive for a while longer after that regardless.

Interesting.  I will ask my endo.  I wonder if an anti anxiety pill will work too.  Anything that would help me relax during the long stretch would be welcomed!

Hey there. I am becoming a “regular”. I just started in March so I’m on my 4th visit. I had a laser session on my body hair while I was in last. I like their new laser machine. I was in there on Thursday and Friday of last week so we missed each other. How was your experience?

Ah damn, we missed each other. I generally avoid talking to the other patients too much anyways cause everyone i meet there is super self conscious looking and i dont bleme them, i mean no one going there is looking their finest during treatment, myself included, so i get it.
</p>
<p>
For laser, Yes, im a blonde so i had written off laser but denise told me that shed give me a discount if i tried it because they wanted to see how well it would work for future blonde patients, i wasnt the first person on it but i did get to use it when they were still in the lockdown since im local. and despite all the stories you hear of laser doing nothing for blondes im pleased with the results, plus its nice to like go there without having bruises on my way home.
</p>
<p>
For the electrolysis,  yeah, pretty much everything you saod i agree with. I dont do my ears and upper sideburns though, since i think it makes my fringe look thicker overall.  The first id say 5 sessions were absolutely brutal, but i had apparently more than normal.  Ive been on hrt for like 8 years and im fully out, and i never noticed a difference in my facial hair so i just got really good at color correction (i was too poor to afford to do this earlief in life). Again, apparently this is common for blondes, and ive been told over and over laser wasnt an option for blonde facial hair.
</p>
<p>
The worst of it is def the lidocaine but after that its smooth sailing. If your neck is really uncomfortable you can ask them gently to raise your heD. Almost everyone will oblige except sabrina or maria, they are both pickier and have less bedside manner but they are also probably the fastest.  I think a major problem for me is because i needed two techs every time they will give me one of the new girls with one of the experienced ones and the newer girls will be a lot slower.  The last time i went was only 4 hours total, while the first y or so were complete 8 hour sessions.
</p>
<p>
As for as results its always stunning for 2 to 4 weeks then you get regrowth.  The regrowth is significantly less about every 3 visits after you hit all the growth cycles (i think full cycle is 6 months) and i noticed even if i touch it without shavibg it feels coarse, but a lot of the regrowth is clear hairs that you cant see easily and there is a lot more space between hairs.  6 sessions is about a year for ne so i think by 12 or 14 i should have next to nothing.  And im apparently like a worst case scenario, as a blonde trans woman on hrt a long time who did get full growth from puberty.  So yeah i wish it was faster but its still coming along.
</p>
<p>
I will finally say that the session do get shorter eventually, and this last session i barely had any swelling.  I just took some ibu and im 2 days out from electro and im already mostly back to normal, when in the past yes, it did take 4 to 7 days to completely get rid of swelling. I didnt even ice this time, just zinc and ibuprophen.
</p>
<p>
Also, for gcs they told me the full cycle is like 1 montb so a full clearing for gcs is like 6 months?  Not sure if this is true as i didnt do gcs electro with them.
</p>
<p>
Sorry im a rambler.  Not many people share this experience! I know it sucks but i think its a good place to stick to and def has a lot of trans experience.

I agree totally.  I have been working with Natasha and Maria.  Both are nice but Maria is more business...I am ok with that...she is good at what she does.
</p>
<p>
I am sorry we missed each other too...I was in a hurry to get done and get home.  I am busy with work so needed to recover and get busy.
</p>
<p>
I Sabrina the owner?  I still do not know all their names.
</p>
<p>
My GRS clearing isnt too bad I guess bc the session doesnt take as long.  I am still not sure if I will ever get GRS but I still like it bare down below.

Ah, sure.  Maybe I&#39;ll see if they&#39;ll snag those for me at my next visit.  They aren&#39;t bad but it&#39;d be nice to be closer to perfect.

Yes...I had laser several times. It just didn&#39;t work for me.  The lasers have gotten better so I don&#39;t want to discount them.  I had mine done several years ago so its not the same as today.  I just do not want to risk the time or money.
</p>
<p>
What was your experience?  Did you do well with laser and was it recent?
