Well, now I know what I want for my birthday
</p>
<p>
Why do you say you wish you had gone bigger?  That&#39;s really hard to see based on your pics.  Also, those are excellent pictures, very helpful!

I mean, I&#39;m content with my size. But when I put on the pushup bra, that&#39;s the size I really want.

I must have something setup wrong because I don&#39;t see a title link, and hovering my mouse over the post title doesn&#39;t show that I can click on it. all I see is the NSFW tag, but that isn&#39;t clickable either.

Hi! You look great! How big did you go? Are these silicone? Would you recommend the experience overall with Dr. Pousti?

Hi, yes. I got 425cc silicone implants in each breast. The warranty card says &#34;MENTOR MemoryGel smooth round moderate plus profile&#34;. So, that&#39;s what I got.
</p>
<p>
I did tons of research as far as what type of implant I wanted, ended up on silicone. I wasn&#39;t a fan of any of the surgeons here in town after seeing their work. So a checked out surgeons online, on realself. Some surgeons had good results, but have never works on a transgirl before.
</p>
<p>
I came across Dr. Pousti&#39;s profile &amp; he had
<em>
tons
</em>
of reviews, mostly all positive. So I checked out his work and his results looked amazing! So I checked to see if he&#39;s worked on transgirls, he has, &amp; their results looked amazing.
</p>
<p>
I called him up, scheduled a consult, &amp; booked the surgery. Cost me $7500. But in the end, it was worth every penny. I&#39;m
<em>
extremely
</em>
satisfied with my results. I only wish I&#39;d gone a size or two bigger. But he said you don&#39;t want to go too big too fast.

Well, I didn&#39;t fly, I drove. But the restrictions were about a week before traveling. We just rented a hotel room for a week right on the beach. I thought it would be a good idea to have a view of the ocean, but it really didn&#39;t matter. I didn&#39;t see it much until we left because I was pretty much bedridden the whole time. So if you decide you&#39;re going to get a hotel room for a week, just go with whatever is cheap.
</p>
<p>
Coming out of surgery is like getting hit by a freight train, so you&#39;re going to be in the bed a lot at first.

Here&#39;s the thing. If you go over the muscle then the breasts feel more natural as far as squeezing and jogging and whatnot, but unless you already have a good amount of breast tissue, you&#39;re going to end up with boobs that basically look like two bubbles on your chest. You&#39;ll be able to see the edges of the implants and it won&#39;t look natural at all. On the otherhand, if you have a decent amount of breast tissue then your results are going to look great.
</p>
<p>
So pretty much, if you don&#39;t have a lot of breast tissue you&#39;re going to want to go under the muscle to get a more natural look.
</p>
<p>
Also, the reason I went with silicone over saline is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
If a saline implant gets a hole or ruptures then your body will absorb the saline &amp; you&#39;ll be left with one flat boob and one regular boob. The only way to fix it is to go into surgery again, so unless you have that spare money laying around...
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a silicone implant gets a hole or ruptures then the silicone stays contained inside the implant. It&#39;s a gel &amp; it&#39;s congestive, so it holds its shape. Your body doesn&#39;t absorb it. You don&#39;t get left with a flat or misshapen boob &amp; there&#39;s not any health hazards.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And the number 1 reason I don&#39;t recommend getting saline:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Stay with me on this one. It&#39;s a bit disturbing, but people should know. I watched an episode of
<em>
Monsters Inside Me
</em>
about a woman who&#39;s implants were making her really sick. Turns out that her saline implants somehow got a fungus inside of them. Well, saline is full of water &amp; no white blood cells. AKA the fungus spread like crazy inside the implant, with no immune system to take care of it. The fungus? It&#39;s the same one responsible for black mold. So anyways, the fungus would produce toxins that would leach into her system. She had the implant surgically removed and they ended up being pitch black. She was told that if the implant had ruptured while still inside of her it could&#39;ve put her system into shock and killed her. After all was said &amp; done, she was left with an extreme sensitivity to fungus, so much so that she had to move out of her own house and into a trailer in their yard that had plastic everywhere that she had a constantly clean with bleach. Not fun. It turns out that although rare, this is a thing that does happen from time to time.

</li>
<li>
<p>
Silicone on the otherhand doesn&#39;t have this issue. The implants are a cohesive gel. There&#39;s no water inside for any bacteria or fungus to spread. I haven&#39;t found a single case of silicone implants causing a fungal infection.

Silicone doesn&#39;t produce anymore long term scarring than saline. The membrane/shell of the implant is the only part of the implant that comes in physical contact with your body. Both saline and silicone are kept within the same silicone membrane. That&#39;s right, both are in a silicone shell. There are many different types of silicone. Some are hard and rubbery like the implant shells. Some are less viscous, slimy, &amp; sticky. Some are somewhere in-between. Some are medical grade &amp; medically safe. Most are not to be used medically. Industrial-use silicones come out as a thick liquid and hardens solid.
</p>
<p>
So back to the implants. The silicone within the implant shell is a cohesive gel. It stays self-contained, even in a rupture, &amp; doesn&#39;t leach into your system. Hell
<a href="https://youtu.be/atWoxYpGatM" rel="nofollow">here&#39;s a video</a>
of one being completely cut in half.
</p>
<p>
Now compare that to one
<a href="https://youtu.be/6chBEQi9k1s" rel="nofollow">from the 80&#39;s</a>
being cut in half.
</p>
<p>
So with all this being said, when it comes to long-term scarring, you&#39;re either thinking of one of two things.
</p>
<p>
You might be thinking of the first generations of silicone implants, which were big news in the early 90&#39;s for their safety. When older people hear of silicone, those news stories probably come to mind. Those types of implants were not only completely banned, but they aren&#39;t even manufactured anymore.
</p>
<p>
The silicone implants of today are gen 4 &amp; gen 5. So far to date after getting approved in 2006 &amp; 2012, scarring hasn&#39;t been much more of an issue than saline.
</p>
<p>
The other thing you could be thinking of is underground/illegal silicone injections aka &#34;garage injections&#34;, which are highly-illegal I &amp; unsafe, and are done with non-medical industrial-use silicone, which is toxic &amp; hardens to a solid. These do cause scarring &amp; many other problems, &amp; can even kill you. These are usually performed by people with no medical background to people trying to save a pretty penny. But again, illegal &amp; underground &amp; with a different type of silicone that you could pick up at Home Depot.
</p>
<p>
Either way, the silicone implants of today don&#39;t produce anymore scarring than saline.

Will read the full reply later, but I read the start and, I didn&#39;t mean that as an comparison between saline and silicone but overall, that silicone in general produces scarring because your body rejects that
<em>
foreign
</em>
material .... I wonder why people don&#39;t so lipo to breasts.
