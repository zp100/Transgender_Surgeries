An theres countless others she didnt but tbh i see why nobody post good results on these sites cuz all yall do is bash like it makes me sick to my stomach like us as trans woman want to be accepted but were so quick to bash this woman‚Äôs past weither botched complications or not like yall make me sick Grow up just like we‚Äôve changed from male to female she can change from bad to good nobody perfect but yall dont see that. This will be my last post most likely since my opinion is always pushed down i got negatives on everything i say so what is the point?? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

By all means if this site makes you ‚Äúsick to your stomach‚Äù then don‚Äôt subject yourself to this kind of torture of other transgender women giving their sisters a heads up of what to expect.
</p>
<p>
I want nothing but the best for my sisters and I was botched. If I can spare another girl that kind of heartache and time, recovery and mental anguish than I will do it.
</p>
<p>
Again I‚Äôm glad you got good results but if you‚Äôre an expert surgeon the results should be consistent across the board with good results and not botchery.

When I had my surgery the initial work was okay.
<br>
HOWEVER her aftercare sucked narcs. Having her patients climb three flights of stair to her  facility&#39;s rehab rooms after three days in a hospital was pretty bad.
<br>
Also, totally immobilizing her patients for three days after surgery (I&#39;m talking three inches in any direction was pretty bad, I also know of on girl who found packing material in her vagina long after she left the clinic.

An so have i but ALL im saying is its her PAST thats it im not gonna downplay anything i just want people to know she has changed an tbh if yu did 250 surgeries in a year do yu expect every one of them to be perfect?? Ive seen hanna an many more an ive even had my own bumps in the road an im only 24days post op but it is a healing process but she did the one thing I desired make my gender match what I mentally feel an with that shes given every girl just that a sexual reassignment from male to female or female to male weither good bad or ugly she did just that shes not god shes not perfect an neither is anyone else but she dose what not many even try to do if that makes any sence

Congrats on your surgery! I‚Äôm happy you got a great result. I‚Äôm also very thankful you decided to post your results because there are very few black women sharing their SRS results here.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Kathy Rumor has a bad track record because if you look in the wiki here you‚Äôll see a lot of folks who are heartbroken and afraid because of what she‚Äôs done. The way she has been shown to handle complications and dissatisfied patients shows that going with her seems to be a bigger risk than what‚Äôs typically seen amongst SRS surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm glad that surgery went well for you and that in the end the risk you took paid off but it doesn‚Äôt erase all the other patients of Kathy Rumer who are really suffering. I hope that healing goes smoothly for you!

Im not saying she is god or she‚Äôs perfect but I just hate that everyone judges her cuz she had bad bedside manor or that complications arise cuz we all have to be real when we sign that paper of surgical consent it says so many things can go wrong im 25 i went to school for medical billing an coding do yu know how much she can loose if she ever admitted that she did ‚Äúfuck up‚Äù hello medical malpractice!!! But im not saying her past aint relevant but it is her past people live an learn if people can accept a felon whos come home an changed their life or a transwoman whos born opposite of what their identity is why can they move on from her past results

You seem to be one of the lucky ones. Hopefully you still feel the same way about her after you&#39;re swelling goes down in a few months. I truly do wish you the best.

Congratulations!!! I  went to Dr. Rumer too. On Jan. 28, 2021, it will be one year since my correction. I am 11 months and a few weeks now. There is still some minor swelling and I, like you am very satisfied with my results. I am glad you spoke out on Dr. Rumer&#39;s behalf. As you said, I did not want to share my positive experience because of any backlash since there are so many people who have negative things to say about Rumer that the women who have had good experiences with her stay silent. This is not to discount those people who have had very serious issues. I had my first orgasm at 3 and a half months. At 5 and a half months, I started having intercourse and have been enjoying my body and having positive sexual experiences. Full depth and sensation. I even purchased the orange dilator and use it here and there. Dr. Rumer gave me the best birthday present so I share your sentiments in so far as everyone&#39;s experience with Dr. Rumer is different and I am happy with my results. I did two years of research on doctors and the procedure itself and had full and complete knowledge of the worst possible outcome versus the best possible outcome. I am grateful I was someone who came out satisfied with my correction and I am able to fully enjoy my femaleness.

I find it very odd how you researched for 2 years and thought Rumer was the best, but to each their own.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad your are happy with your results, however I&#39;m extremely embarrassed by mine every time i have sexy times I get dysphoric and find that I use my hands to cover the area so no one else can see.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind would you care to look at my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/kppfb0/postop_dysphoria_with_kathy_rumer_results/" rel="nofollow">results

and giving me your feedback as a fellow patient of hers?

I posted my review at 5 months on Google and I also posted a review on Dr. Rumer&#39;s Facebook page and as the original poster said, women with positive experiences with Dr. Rumer are always discredited which is why I declined to post here until I saw this post.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I would not mind taking a look at your results but everyone has a very different experience with Dr. Rumer and my deepest compassion goes out to you and anyone else that is unsatisfied with their experience with Dr. Rumer. I can only share mine.

In an odd round about way claiming to have success with Rumer may come off as insensitive to those who have suffered at her hands. In other words you&#39;re invalidating their experience and their pain by claiming how well yours went. I think anyone would be upset if that was what was going on, especially if they were already being gaslit by Rumer and her staff.

I have actually seen your photos and I deeply sympathize and have the utmost compassion for you and others. I am by no means a doctor but it looks like necrosis happened on the bottom part of your outer labia which is when the skin dies due to lack of blood flow. That is a complication that I too was very concerned about as with all of the other complications. I had some granulation tissue that needed to be treated once at around 3 months but going into the surgery I was aware of all the possible complications and with the negative reviews of Rumer I still took a chance because it was my only option because of insurance (if I could afford it I would have gone to Dr. Kamol in Thailand). I did most of my research on the procedure itself in addition to looking and talking to actual patients of Dr. Rumer. I met a woman who also went to Rumer and she had good results so for me, meeting a woman who went to Rumer, was satisfied and showed me in person made me confident about my decision.  I am so sorry you are going through challenges. I could have easily been you or anyone else so I have the utmost empathy. I could have also went to another surgeon and I could be dissatisfied. I am grateful.

at least you went in to it knowingly. Not many people have been given a clear understanding of the results she has. I spent weeks off and on trying to research only her and could not find anything. no reviews pictures, nothing. Which only lead to my confusion after seeing my results and the complaints of others months after my surgery. I like you understood the complication that could come from the surgery, and the likelihood of revisions from, well any surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I glad yours seemed to go off without a hitch, but for me, I was told repeatedly that any necrosis, loss of depth, or malformation was do to my poor up keep. I did everything she asked, however, even under optimal conditions (what I did achieve) it is impossible to control what skin tissues decide to die or how your body will adjust to it&#39;s new shape once it relaxes and is no longer swollen. For the most part those are all controlled on the operating table. To know this and to still be told that &#34;you&#39;re healing beautifully&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t do revisions&#34;. Then to have my remaining appointments canceled along with the multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain all my medical records so I can get a revision done by a different doctor shows the contrast in how we were treated by her. She has her golden success stories that she promotes to the world and victims that she disregards and tries to shame into silence.
</p>
<p>
I like you knew it was a coin-flip, and I like you was hopeful for a good result, like she promised. We just ended up on opposite sides of her skill level. I do yield that she can do some decent work, however several doctors have commented on how she is keeping the revision industry alive. Good examples or not it does not excuse what she has done to the community, and the heartbreak it has caused.
</p>
<p>
...I really did contemplate suicide. After my last chat with her: the loss of hope of being fixed, the shame of what now exists between my legs, and the despair of navigating life with chronic pain and dysmorphia. I wonder how you would have reacted or felt if you ended up like me.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: How was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. Rumer over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. Rumer? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity? Are you planning to undergo any revision surgery or medical tattoos? How was the stay in PA? How was Dr. Rumer&#39;s aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery
</p>

My recovery has been tbh hell i hated the catheter i hated the not being able to do thing i felt invalid for the first week tbh i started my transition at 14 i googled srs an found dr rumer fast forward 11 years an she was 1 out of 2 docs that would bill my insurance on a sca cuz i live in the lovers state lol va an they dont have a surgeon out here. So my choices were limited. I went to her cuz tbh she is the only one that i felt was straight forward she told me shell give me 6 inches an a beautiful cosmetic appearance an she was literally straight forward not holding my had which showed me shes not pressed so far o love ever bit of it cosmetically an sensitivity ill say she did the damn thing cuz tbh i was castrated in 2015 an i only had a good handful if thAt to work with as far as a revision tbh no unless i get lazy an ms pum (thats her name) close on me i may get a tattoo tho saying procceed with caution cuz shes a suction cup lol my stay in pa was dreadful i had to quarantine in pa cuz the health department of pa put my state on restriction so i stayed in a extended stay her after care ehhhh ill say this I mostly spoke with her office they communicate well tbh after yur surgery moreso then before an she was gentle with reassuring with everything i had panics i had things I thought were wrong or off but I listened an come to find out like she said days later things became easier an better as far as a recommendation ill say this I would recommend someone only if they do there research on srs that they‚Äôve read every paperwork given an is mentally prepared that the doctor is not gonna hold yur hand cuz ur crying that yu feel like yur not peeing enough in the catheter or something is tingling.. i spent hours watching every srs related video on YouTube an googled everything that popped to mind on it an even reviewed cis womans vaginoplasty results i would recommend her to someone that knows she may have a past on her but people have to grow an learn somehow so maybe ill say yes but also no to anyone who hasn‚Äôt done the above ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ann thanks for the congrats ü•∞

Congrats love I hope you have an amazing recovery! I&#39;m going with her in two and a half weeks. I will be posting my results as well. People need to understand that this is a very risky and complicated surgery and surgeons are humans therefore they make mistakes as everyone else. As you mentioned when signing the papers there&#39;s a list of possible complications that you agree to take the chances for. This is a big surgery this not a simple breast augmentation or rhinoplasty, and even with those there could be serious complications. Every surgeon has their bad cases even the best ones that people praise so much have had botched patients. It&#39;s just a risk and something you have to take in consideration when taking a big step like this.  Pray pray pray and go with your instincts regardless of what doctor you choose to go with.

sadly I know there is no talking someone so close out of it. I can only wish you the best of luck and your results turn out better than mine. Please make sure to tell her what you want before the surgery: aesthetic, depth, etc. she tends to give people a standard 5.5&#34; and unlike cis girls our vaginas do not expand much, so of you want more depth than that make your voice heard.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of how it is turning out she will tell you that you are healing beautifully. if you have any concerns go see an OBG or PCP and get a second opinion. Also do not be hasty in your review as you probably wont get a clear gauge of what things will look like till after the swelling goes down 3-4 month (at least that is how long it took for me).

with, so I&#39;m hoping against the odds that she does a better job with you. for reference

Judging someone on their whole body of work is the exact opposite of judging a book by  its cover.

Are yu saying every surgery shes done is botched?? Thats judging a whole body of work there are plenty of people who have had great results an some not so great kinda goes with the odds of 250 surgeries a year dnt ya think the cover of the story is kathy rumer has a past which is unfortunate to others but not every surgery she has done has the same story hun even jeezebels article says
<a href="https://jezebel.com/when-surgeons-fail-their-trans-patients-1844774990" rel="nofollow">Many patients who go to Dr. Rumer for bottom surgery are happy with their results.
</a>
so how can yu judge someone who‚Äôs soposto have a whole article against her yet it states a very conflicting statement?? People are human an their past things in life should not determine their future either good or bad its not fair an yull be a complete hypocrite to continue to judge her on things that happened at the beginning of her work with trans people times have changed an its people like yu who would make someone not get the surgery by her but then be botched by bazzar or mcguin or bowers or god knows who else i guess yur picture perfect but then again yu cant be cuz yur not god an neither is she

Look im just comparing her to other surgeons and she has way more bad stories ans also stories about her bad bedside manner.
</p>
<p>
This is a forum for rating surgeons and their results. Its not about only posting positive results  or &#34;he who is without sin&#34;. If Kathy does a few good vaginas- great. But if she does a lot of bad ones that&#39;s important too. We should talk about it.

Did uu read that article there are doctors who have only done 12 surgeries an fuck up this woman does 250 in a year there are bound to be some complications like yes they happen every surgeon has bad days but if yu look at the good vs the bad yull see the good outweighs if she does 250 an 10 people say hey she messed up thats less then 10% like yall have to do some type of research a 7.9% revision rate thats good as hell no shade like foreal thats also one of the reasons if a doctor says only 7.9% revision that means they can brag that hey outta 250 maybe 17 need something fixed weither it be  big or small that means 233 are good how tf is he bad like do yur math yall yes eveyone fucks up an the reason y other doctors have minimum to anything to say is cuz they do maybe half that amout of surgeries in a year just cuz there are bad stories dont mean there arnt hundreds of good ones out there if theres good there is nothing to post if its bad bash her ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what sence do that make
