I&#39;ve seen a lot of people and places suggesting surgilube for good reason, but honestly it&#39;s so expensive even in bulk. I can&#39;t afford to buy this many tubes of the stuff.
</p>
<p>
Are there any solid alternatives that might come at a cheaper price? Especially if they come in big bottles.

It&#39;s a brand new, raw vagina.  Isn&#39;t it worth a sterile, bacteriostatic lube?

This is incredibly fair as a point, and I&#39;m prepared to foot the expense if necessary. It&#39;s just that with the amount of lube people suggest is needed, I&#39;ll be spending literally hundreds on JUST lube. That&#39;s quite the bill to foot.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t sure if there was another option that was also safe and solid to use that maybe came in actual bulk options and not tiny tubes.

Why not start with half a dozen tubes immediately post op.  Use it the first 4-6 weeks while still healing and switch over to something cheaper after.

That seems like a solid plan! Hopefully it&#39;ll do the trick. Of course, after discussing it over with the doctor and all

The lube doesn&#39;t need to be sterile or bacteriostatic, and the lubes that surgeons often hand out to post-op patients usually aren&#39;t anyway. Besides, Surgilube isn&#39;t actually all that good -- the ingredients are basically on par with regular KY, which is terrible lube.

Amazon makes their own lube &amp; it’s called FAV! Comes in a big 33.5 oz pump bottles &amp; it’s $20. It’s water based, isn’t sticky &amp; cleans up well!

I tried a LOT of different types of lube, and my absolute favorite is still Slippery Stuff Gel (not the regular liquid.) It doesn&#39;t contain glycerin, so it never gets sticky (or promote yeast infections), and it&#39;s pretty affordable for a high-quality lube -- you can find
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slippery-Stuff-Water-based-Lubricant-Pack/dp/B078HV733W/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=slippery+stuff+gel&amp;qid=1597001177&amp;sr=8-4" rel="nofollow">32oz quantities on Amazon for around $25-ish</a>
. I&#39;ve been using it for dilating for a year and a half, and it&#39;s also

for sex, too!

So far I&#39;ve tried KY Ultragel, Sliquid Sassy Gel, and Slippery Stuff Gel.  As far as lubrication I think I like the KY the best, but it is also the least viscous.  The Sliquid is a bit more viscous and the slippery stuff is the most viscous of the 3.  Being more viscous means less chance of it dripping everywhere, which is convenient.  If you started with metrogel you know how that shit just stayed exactly where you put it, very viscous.
</p>
<p>
KY cost me $21 for 9oz.  Thats 2.33 per ounce
</p>
<p>
Sliquid cost $13.40 for 8.5oz.  Thats 1.57 per ounce
</p>
<p>
Slippery stuff is the only one that comes in a reasonable size for us people who need infinite amounts of lube for the rest of our lives and comes in at $28.80 for 32oz.  Thats 90 cents per ounce
</p>
<p>
All 3 worked just fine for me, but I have a slightly easier time with the KY.  This is probably mostly because of the hematoma I have.  Its putting some pressure on the canal and probably causing some of the more viscous lubes to just get pushed aside resulting in less lubrication further down the line.  I need to revisit the Slippery Stuff and Sliquid again once the hematoma is completely gone and I bet I won&#39;t notice a difference in them anymore.  At that point I will probably switch to Slippery Stuff most likely as it is the most viscous and the cheapest AND it comes in a pump bottle so thats pretty convenient.
</p>
<p>
Most of these lubes come in small bottles that are only a few dollars if you want to try them before committing to a large quantity.  Honestly, everyone has different opinions on lube and I gave up looking for advice on it and decided to just try a whole bunch.

Oh, also, I&#39;m not sure where you saw surgilube prices, but on Amazon where I was looking it was $17.73 for 17 ounces, which comes out to only $1.04 per ounce putting it right between slippery stuff and sliquid as not a terrible value.  Though I have no idea where you live and amazon loves to mess with prices based on location and also you could just live in a completely different country lol

I hadn&#39;t considered prices by the ounce like this, it does put it in a good perspective honestly so thank you! I&#39;ve never been good with math honestly. I suppose then it&#39;s not too bad.
</p>
<p>
I wonder how much that would compare to something like k-lube where you get like, 8 gallons of it depending but for a hefty sum.

Sliquid is what I use, either the silicone or hybrid versions. My surgeon recommended it, it’s fairly cheap, one bottle lasts forever. As long as you clean the dilators before and after every use using silicone doesn’t hurt them. You’ll also get a little deeper with a silicone lube and it feels better in your vagina.

I like KY Silk-E the best but if you get regular KY gel and water it down a bit it works pretty much as good. Relatively cheap too.

Idk if you&#39;ve had surgery yet but maybe the surgeons office can give you samples?
</p>
<p>
After my chest surgery they wanted me to use aquaphor and they gave me a TON of sample packets of it, which I was happy about because it is expensive.

Unrelated but I’m preparing for bottom surgery myself. Can surgilube be written as a prescription?
