Did notice some blood on my vulva, even after wiping things down with the wet wipes they give you for cleanup. Should I drop back down to the blue dilator? Thanks for the help y&#39;all!
</p>
<p>
Edit #1: Any other tips/advice on healing would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
Edit #2: Going to be documenting my healing progress on a weekly basis so people can get a better idea of scope start to finish. Was thinking daily, but it would probably be too difficult to remember

<p>
Of course! I&#39;ll break down a few more things in case others are curious too ðŸ˜Š I don&#39;t exactly remember the time from consult to surgery, but ballpark about a year and a half, and then six months of waiting before the actual consult. I live in CT, so it was just a day off work and a train ride for me. Altogether, about two years, give or take a month or two.
</p>
<p>
Biggest commitment was honestly the hair removal, and that took a year total at about an hour per session of electrolysis even for the relatively small area she has you do. Total cost for that was ballpark $2.5k and I&#39;m working on getting that reimbursed through insurance.
</p>
<p>
Airbnb in NYC came to $3.5k for the month, and then the deductible of what I had to pay for insurance was $3.5k. So, cost of surgery, not including food and transportation during recovery works out to about $9.5k total. I would probably budget at least another $1.5k to $2k in addition to that $9.5k total if you want to factor in food, transportation, and misc. recovery related supplies.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Regarding hair removal, Bluebond-Langner does a follicle scrape prior to surgery, so my recommendation is to get laser first, and
<em>
then
</em>
go back through with electrolysis. The only reason I did full electrolysis is because that&#39;s the only way insurance would reimburse me.

Bluebond-Langner has you stay within an hour of the hospital for about a month after surgery.

Probably a good idea. I should factor that expense in my budget. Did someone care for you? Did you leave the house to get food and stuff?

Are you in position to leave the house and be in public? If so how long did that take? Just wondering for my own surgery. I need to fine someone that can care for me, depending on where that might be.

Not exactly sure what you mean here... If you&#39;re talking about  me leaving the Airbnb where I&#39;m staying and walking around the city, I just had the surgery about a week ago, so I&#39;m not quite there yet. Still semi-sore and waddling from general discomfort and the underwear and pads I&#39;m wearing to take care of blood... Definitely need someone helping with recovery, or at least highly recommend it. You&#39;re going to be bored/lonely in the hospital, and beyond that, I can walk/stand, but I can&#39;t even think about bending over to pick something up, and doing any of that for a long period probably doesn&#39;t help with recovery. Just some things to consider.

Thanks for the info. I am just trying to plan ahead. I suppose I could go to a care center, if I donâ€™t have someone to help out. I guess they donâ€™t have to be there 24 hours a day. Are you watching Netflix programs? Thanks again, Sarah

Curious if you ended up going in for your scheduled consult, or if you got an earlier slot via cancellation.  I currently have a consult scheduled for August of 2023 and I&#39;d love to be able to get in earlier.  I live close enough to come in for the day without much notice.

Not OP but I got a cancellation consult with Dr. Bluebond Langner. I called every few days and finally one of the schedulers told me that Iâ€™d have a better shot if I had my letters already. I gathered them and submitted, then that same day they offered me a much sooner consult.

nice!  they told me on the phone that they wouldn&#39;t consider me for a cancellation slot until I got my letters in, so I&#39;m working on that.  Hopefully I&#39;ll have them all in the next few weeks

Honestly not that bad. Most of the pain I&#39;ve had can be managed with ibuprofen, but they do give you opiates for serious breakthrough pain if you need it. Fortunately, I haven&#39;t, but ymmv.

Congrats! Even near the end of your first week post op, things are looking good.
</p>
<p>
How are you feeling? How was your experience with Dr. Bluebond-Langnerâ€™s office from start to finish? I just had a initial consultation with her &amp; Dr. Zhao earlier this month, and this makes things feel more promising.

Experience overall has been pretty smooth and textbook. Called her office requesting a consultation, stuck to the process of getting letter and everything else, and now here we are. No major hiccups or anything.

Did you get a surgery date the same day you had your consult?
</p>
<p>
And if you donâ€™t mind me asking, how much material did you have to work with pre op? Iâ€™m kinda curious how that affects things.

I did, yes, but that was nearly two years ago now. I&#39;m not sure how things may have changed between now and then. As for &#34;material&#34;, I was definitely bigger than average, but not by a ridiculous amount - more of a grower than shower.

Maybe things have changed. I had my consult, but Iâ€™m still confused as to what is supposed to happen next. I wasnâ€™t offered a date.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing, I similar (but they only seemed to document the state of my material at its base rather than maximum. Iâ€™m assuming having more material to work with is a good thing.

Thanks for sharing. I finally got a call yesterday from the social worker who said I had to get to a BMI of 38 before requesting a surgery date. I thought Iâ€™d just continue working on my weight while waiting, but I guess I have to lose some beforehand.

Only 6in, but that doesn&#39;t bother me too much because I&#39;m a lesbian. Might explore with toys later down the line when I&#39;m healed, but otherwise pretty happy ðŸ˜Š

Thank you! I was curious, Iâ€™m at the notch, so wanted to know what depth that was. Sounds like 7 or 8 if thatâ€™s 6.

Yeah, honestly wish I had more depth, but again, not a deal breaker given the aesthetics/function, which were my biggest concerns. For reference, the dilators are all about 9in long, so you can guestimate based on that.
