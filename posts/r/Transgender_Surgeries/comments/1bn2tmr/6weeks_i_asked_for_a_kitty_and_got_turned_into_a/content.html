As the title suggests, I had Vaginoplasty with Dr. Gupta 6 weeks back. I don&#39;t hear much about this surgeon compared to others and I want to post to provide some insight on him. For title clarity, I was given Kerecis (Fish Skin) for my PPT. That is also not talked about very much and it&#39;s absolutely amazing and needs to be spread further. Sorry if I am dragging out too much details!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Background
</strong>
<br>
Before the surgery, I was looking for any affordable surgeon that would be safe for me. I suffer from a lot of anxiety when it comes to huge medical hurdles so I had to choose carefully. I made a list of surgeons which I could find few or sparse negative reviews for and Dr. Gupta was one of them. I called them back in June/July 2023 and the scheduled my consultation on September 2023. Afterwards, my papers were handed in which consisted of 2 therapist letters and I received a surgery date in February 2024. The turnaround on this was really quick. They told me they would provide an estimate around December. My insurance actually changed in 2024 so this was really stressful since I had a completely new insurance from my company with no idea if they would allow my surgery. My previous insurance was Aetna and it took around 3 months of calling to confirm that the surgery was greenlit. However, the surgical team was amazing and got it done within the month before surgery!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Surgery
</strong>
<br>
I remember being in the car super nervous and crying when we were headed there. I was hugging my plushie and just hoping everything would go well. Everyone at the facility was so nice and comforting though. They kept reassuring me that everything would be okay and that I will be in safe hands. Dr. Gupta and Dr. Mishra, who assisted, both came to my bed and helped calm me down. My friends were there to make sure I was okay as well and honestly, you really do need an emotional support person to be there for you during these times. After meds were given, I was wheeled into the operation room and it was lights out. I woke up and I wasn&#39;t in pain at all. It took about 4 hours for the procedure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hospital Stay
</strong>
<br>
Day 0 was pretty painful after my meds started wearing off. I asked for my friends to come and we had a really big open room to ourselves. You could adjust the temperature as you like and food was given three times a day with your choice to select the meal. I was in so much pain, I could barely eat anything. I was begging for meds a lot at this point because my pain tolerance is super low. The nurses were super wonderful to me the entire time. I could not ask for anything more. Passing gas was most of the pain actually; the air would slowly travel through your system and try to get out with your weakened system. Sleeping was extremely difficult. Nausea was super tough on me. My head was just spinning and on fire because I just didn&#39;t drink enough water or have anything in my system. Please don&#39;t be like me. I should have really tried harder for it.
</p>
<p>
Day 3, they forced me to walk around the place and also made me sit in a chair for at least 4 hours just so that I wasn&#39;t in bed the entire time. They were afraid of blood clots even with IPC around my legs. Super difficult but I did it. I walked around with a walker and my IV. This entire time, I brought my games and books but I didn&#39;t touch a single thing this entire trip. My friends were most of the entertainment and I think it would have been impossible to survive without them. There were definitely moments where I just regretted getting the surgery because I felt I wasn&#39;t ready. So please don&#39;t take surgery lightly; it&#39;s a major surgery and a major impact. During this day, I think it was also when some medical examiners came in and informed me that... I had fish skin in me??? That threw me off because before the surgery, I knew they did fish skin for revision but not for vaginoplasty itself. Due to the lack of material, they lined the canal with fish skin instead of cutting more incisions in my abdominal area. I have 5 incisions around that area and more would have been really bad.
</p>
<p>
Day 5, they taught me how to dilate, how to clean myself, and basically discharged me from the hospital. I had a talk with the surgeon first for any questions I had and was given all of the notes on my surgery; every single thing they did (which I don&#39;t understand since I&#39;m not really a medical professional) but also all of the medications I was given, what times they were given, and all of the paperwork in case anything bad happens. Of course, I am a very frantic bean and I still asked them a lot of questions after being discharged but overall, there were no complications except one which is no longer an issue at this date.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hotel Stay
</strong>
<br>
I stayed at a hotel afterwards near the area to make sure that I was okay after being discharged on the 5th day. There wasn&#39;t anything too difficult with the recovery besides just eating and sleeping a lot. There was just so much blood everywhere. I would recommend buying incontinence pads just because sometimes, peeing might be out of your control at first. Blood will also be something that stains everything during your rest. Mesh underwear was a good suggestion from the medical team for cleaning but my pads just didn&#39;t stick to them. Please be kind to yourself and buy cotton pads to avoid any rash and also buy bigger sized underwear that are baggy. The complication I mentioned above is that I also had a wound on the labia near the canal and it reopened pretty badly. I freaked out and dilating hurt a lot. They saw me immediately for a visit and everything was fine. They scheduled me 3 times during my 2 week stay after the surgery to see them. It really showed that they cared and honestly, I can&#39;t imagine being at any other location having the same one-to-one as a new and growing surgeon like the one at Ohio. Even with all of this, I was waking up at 6 AM everyday to dilate and then have breakfast in the cafeteria. At the 1.5 week post-op mark, I think the blood died down and everything was back to normal and it was time to go home.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Home Stay
</strong>
<br>
Getting home through the airport was one of the hardest challenges for me because I was scared I&#39;d accidentally pee. It was bad to the point I was going to get some adult diapers but luckily, my nurse prescribed me Oxybutin which allowed me to hold in my pee for 2 hours; enough for flights and restroom breaks. Honestly it was a life saver. At home, my parents are taking care of me. I had no ability to take care of myself in the first week (3 weeks post op). As time went on, I started being able to sit in places without much pain or effort. My donut pillow has been glued to my butt but now, I can sit without it just fine. 4 weeks in, I was going grocery shopping (not driving yet) and hanging out with my family to places. It was okay for the most part except I would get sleepy extremely quickly. Last week (5 weeks in), I was able to clean the house and also dress up nice and pretty for the first time ever with my regular routine of makeup.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cost Analysis
</strong>
<br>
Surgery Cost: $65k ($3k after insurance)
<br>
Hotel Cost: $2.8k (17 day stay room for 3)
<br>
Plane Tickets: $500 (for myself round trip. Choose wisely and with longer connecting times)
<br>
Uber and Food: $2k (Definitely overspent but I couldn&#39;t make my own food and I had the budget for it. Also complication required for frequent ubering back and forth)
<br>
Total Cost: $8.3k
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dilating
</strong>
<br>
Dilating was extremely painful. Due to the wound reopening, they decided it&#39;s not the best idea to stitch and instead use calcium alginate which helped the wound heal faster. Due to this, I started with the smallest purple and orange dilator and that&#39;s all. I slowly moved up towards the purple one after 3 weeks post op and blue after 4 weeks. I&#39;m still at the blue dilator but I bet anyone else could be farther along without this complication. I can make it inbetween the last two dots so around 5.25 inches. I actually was able to regain depth lost because I could only make it to the third dot due to pain during the first week. Dilating twice a day was absolutely the worst thing in the world. During these days, I dilate 10 times a week but it&#39;s still enough and not losing depth or width. Dilation schedule is 2 times a day, 40 minutes a session.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Okay but why the fish skin title?
</strong>
<br>
As you know, fish skin has been used to treat wounds to heal much faster. In other articles, they have fish skin used for the first week and then removed. Mine is permanently inside and slowly it is converting into regular tissue. With wound reopening and so much blood, I would have expected the usual timeline of getting better around 6 months or 9 months. Yesterday I ran. Yes... I was able to run and just not feel pain. I never ran previously and I am willing to bet I could have a week or so ago too. I can maneuver around and go anywhere without too much bother at all. At first, it was just energy levels but as they slowly have returned, physically there hasn&#39;t been any resistance. I am certain that through healing with fish skin has played an effect and possible an advancement that we all need to get behind. As far as I know, Dr. Gupta and only a few surgeons in the world provide this for this surgery.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, please feel free to ask me anything.

<p>
Is your body absorbing the fish skin and or rejecting it? I’m not a medical doctor, but conversion sounds

fishy

<p>
More info please. This is interesting asf.

Fish skin grafting has been used for a while actually! Primarily for things such as burn wounds or commonly for surgeries where there isn’t enough tissue in the surrounding area to close the wound (common with foot surgeries actually)
</p>
<p>
It does in fact turn into regular tissue over time. The fish skin helps facilitate regeneration— afaik it’s sorta like your skin absorbing it and healing with &amp; over top it! It’s very neat and truly worthwhile to look into medical studies on it if you aren’t squeamish (many tend to be rather graphic)
</p>
<p>
I could be wrong on some aspects, as I am not a professional
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps!

Tysm! I was aware of its uses and always assumed it eventually was completely absorbed or slowly rejected during the time of the healing and replaced with normal healthy tissue. Fascinating asf.

I asked my surgeon about it when he was in my room. He said basically, the resemblance of the tissue are very similar to each other. Due to this, the body will slowly adjust and act like it is its own tissue therefore providing it the same things needed to heal and grow.
</p>
<p>
I wish I also knew more about this as I am also not a medical doctor. But I found some interesting photos of it online which are like this:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/18/6001">https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/18/6001
</a>
</p>
<p>
So far, I think the body has accepted the fish skin and absorbed it on its own because it doesn&#39;t look like fish skin anymore to what I can see but it&#39;s hard to judge. I think over a year, it will be okay. My medical team checked it after 2 weeks and said it seemed to be working as intended.
</p>
<p>
Usually I only know this as a revisionary surgery. I only saw a comment about it here on Reddit:
<br>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/15d5y1j/comment/juannzo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/15d5y1j/comment/juannzo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3

Though aside from this, I don&#39;t see any other posts.

So I looked up Kerecis and read about their fish skin product and WOW! What an amazing thing. Until you mentioned it I did not know this existed.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for posting this. It gives me something to consider about my future choices.

And, of course, congratulations!!

It actually doesn&#39;t. It smells normal like it should. It will become human tissue over time and therefore does not emit any fishy smell. I was told almost all of the bacteria is removed before they place it in which is what emits the smell.

What is probably going on is the fish skin has all the fish cells removed and leaves only the collagen structure and some lipids. Your cells would then, as you heal, grow into that structure.

This is the part I don&#39;t really know. As my surgeon has said, it slowly converts over time because your body will provide it the necessary things to keep it going. I&#39;m not sure how because I would think maybe the skin would be dead and fall off but because of the similarities of tissue with Kerecis and your normal skin there, I guess there&#39;s some conversion. I&#39;m not very well versed as I got it pretty early on. I only learned of it after my surgery so I&#39;ve been trying to research it myself but without much knowledge or information, my friend suggested I post to spread awareness of it and share my experiences since my healing seems really fast.

The fish tissue is decellularized, it’s basically a collagen scafold with anti-bactirial features that gets resorbed.

This info about fish skin could possibly also be really useful for trans guys, since we have to sacrifice a lot with visible graft sites for phallo for example. Makes me more hopeful about potential bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
I also wonder if the fish skin approach could also be used on the vaginoplasty that uses parts of the stomach (?)

Wow I never thought of that. I know Dr Gupta does bottom surgeries for trans guys too. I think he&#39;s still experimenting and testing. Definitely something to look out for in the future! I&#39;m excited for my trans bros :3

Sorry, it&#39;s North Atlantic Cod Kerecis. It&#39;s a graft which is used instead of the Scrotal Skin which I lacked. So it makes the lining of the middle. Peritoneal tissue is still lined in the back and penile in the front for aesthetic

Ok thanks. So essentially it’s a medical device that provides a scaffold for your own tissue to regenerate through it. Cool.
</p>
<p>
Did you previously have a scrotectomy or was the lack of tissue from atrophy?

I just lacked tissue overall as I wasn&#39;t really given much to begin with. I never considered scrotectomy because it just wasn&#39;t something I was interested in as the dysphoria would still be there.

What is fish skin? Is it literally the skin off of a fish? I have never heard of this before.

They used Northern Atlantic Cod Kerecis. I hadn&#39;t heard of it until after the surgery and there&#39;s notes in the op and they briefed me about it. It&#39;s astonishing too because I don&#39;t see anything related to this posted anywhere in the subreddit so I had to share. It&#39;s literally the skin of a fish but worked on to help in a medical environment. There&#39;s cases of it being used for burns but not in this surgery as far as I know of

Fish skin is sometimes used in place of split-thickness skin grafts on other parts of the body , I imagine it is a good option for this procedure actually since it doesn’t carry the risk of growing hair and doesn’t rely on a donor site at all

Thanks for posting this! I&#39;m having a Kerecis revision with Dr Gupta in about two weeks, and this helped settle some anxiety.
</p>
<p>
Background: I had PPV PPT vaginoplasty a bit over 3 years ago with another provider, and it has since completely stenosed. Dr Gupta was the only surgeon I was able to find who would do a revision that wasn&#39;t colon.

I really hope it goes well. I don&#39;t want to over-praise Dr. Gupta but there hasn&#39;t been anything I disliked about it. He seemed very knowledgeable and I really really hope that your revision goes well! Please keep us posted. I wish you the best on your recovery

Thank you for posting this! Here’s my primary choice and his method of ppt is my primary choice e for method. I have my consultation with him in a week so I’ve been scraping as much in for on him as I can but sadly there aren’t many experiences shared out there. Do you mind if I DM you and ask a couple of questions?

Is this Gupta at University Hospital?

<p>
I’ve had 3 people - 2 from Reddit and 1 from Dr. Ferando’s office told me not to get a revision with him.

Yes, this is with UHHospitals in Ohio for Dr. Gupta. Can you elaborate on anything bad that they have experienced? I am also curious and want to provide people with both good and bad sides

I don’t have a question but just wanted to say: wow, that is incredibly cool! I’m super happy for you, I was worried for awhile until later in the post you made it clear  that the unusual-sounding thing is a

thing XD

Does the fish skin create an area that can self lubricate like a peritoneal graft?

For what I can tell, it does but it&#39;s hard to dictate at the early stages. It&#39;s currently a bit too much right now since I&#39;m still wearing liner a lot but I&#39;m unsure if that&#39;s because of the peritoneal tissue or because of the fish skin. Though my surgeon said the lubricating will slowly get less and less, it&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re saying that to encourage lubing or saying that as a prediction rather than factual. I&#39;ll have to get to this in a year lol

Hi! Really excited about the new technology! I consulted my insurance, though, they say this one is experimental and investigational and therefore could not be covered. How did you manage to get it covered? Thanks!!!!

I just had my bottom surgery consultation today and one of the options I was given was to use kerecis to create my canal. One of the things I was told is that some women experience wetness but not brought on by arousal. I was told that some women who have had kerecis used basically have to wear a pad every day due to the constant excessive wetness. Is this something that you have experienced?
