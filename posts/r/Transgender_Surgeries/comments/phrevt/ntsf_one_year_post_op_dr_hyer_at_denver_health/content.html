Sorry for the noob question but I don&#39;t understand how women who have had bottom surgery have hair down there. Doesn&#39;t bottom surgery require you get rid of pretty much all hair in the pubic region (typically with electrolysis)?

Great question, complicated answer... My pre-surgical instructions indicated that I should have hair removed from the shaft, scrotum, and peritoneum. I did have several courses of electrolysis with minimal success. When it came to my surgery date, I was advised that the tissues to be used would be scraped and the follicles would be cauterized. The complicated part is that each surgeon has their own minimum hair removal requirements. For areas around the surgical site, it is normally recommended to leave the hair in place in order to hide the surgical scars.
