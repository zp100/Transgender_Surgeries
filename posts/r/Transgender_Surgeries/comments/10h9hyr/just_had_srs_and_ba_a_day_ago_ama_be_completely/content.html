looks like right after a surgery. It looks good are you looking for a critique on your doctors work on what looks &#34;good&#34; right after surgery?

They all said it already but I believe you should give it more time before you start critiquing the work. Just focus on healing.
</p>
<p>
On another note, congrats on the surgery :). Hope you heal soon, and that you’re happy with the results.

I had bottom surgery 3 years ago and a revision 6ish weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Everything will be / is swollen and discolored beyond belief. Black, blue, red, white, puffy. That’s just the healing process. It’s scary and I know you care about the results. But it looks completely different after a month, after 3 months, and even super different after 6 months.
</p>
<p>
Can’t stress over how it looks so soon. Just focus on taking good care of it and helping it heal. It’ll balloon 3 times in size, but it’ll be perfectly fine. Even if you need a revision, that’s something that wouldn’t happen until everything settles down several months from now.  (I’m age 23 rn)
</p>
<p>
Edit: my first surgery was a single stage one. I had a stitch come out too soon while healing so skin healed incorrectly / fused in the wrong place. Super minor thing. The revision was mostly external with a small change to my urethra

👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
</p>
<p>
Do NOT ask about aesthetics after a day. You will absolutely ruin your mental health.
</p>
<p>
Wait 6 weeks, ask again. Then again at 6 months. THEN, start talking to your surgeon about a possible revision IF YOURE UNSATISFIED around 8 months.
</p>
<p>
BUT A DAY?! Girl, just focus on your healing. You got a shitty couple weeks ahead of not sleeping well, being weirdly uncomfortable, and dilating more than you do anything else in a day.
</p>
<p>
Ease up on yourself and rest.

Looks great for what can be seen so far.   Don&#39;t be surprised if it starts to look a little more &#39;got in a street fight&#39; over the next few days - that is normal, and nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Is that packing that is visible in the middle, or have they already taken all of that out?  At one day out I am little surprised to not see a urinary catheter still in place, unless that is what that tube is and it just seems a bit low because of the swelling.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I wouldn&#39;t expect anything less than a beautiful result when all is said and done based on what things look like now.  Congrats!!  💜💜

Even if it&#39;s the first day, you can already see that the surgeon did a great job.

For a day after surgery it looks amazing. Mine looked like a nightmare for a month or so until the sutures dissolved and the swelling went down.

looks incredible for just 1 day after surgery. Obviously you wont be able to tell how it will look until at least a couple months.

So far it looks amazing! I&#39;ve not seen the results immediately after before, wasn&#39;t expecting so much blood tbh. If you want to take pics day by day or week by week or something to show how it heals over time, I imagine people would like to see that. Admittedly I&#39;m just curious, it&#39;s not a surgery I need, but I like to learn about all of them because I have transfem friends.
</p>
<p>
Congrats on getting your surgeries, by the way! What a wonderful milestone! Hope your healing goes well, just take it day by day 💜

Looks like a fresh surgery which means everything’s going to be a bit beaten up for a while! However I do see some great shapes there from the surgeon and can really see that once you’re more healed up everything’s going to come together very nicely

To be brutally honest everything short of ‘looks like a bloody car crash’ would be a lie. After lengthy brutal turning parts of your body inside out where swelling will last for weeks and the final results won’t be seen for months you probably need to wait a little longer to here if it’s nice a neat. That picture looks like you are still on the operating table, you need a bit more time I’d say! I hope your recovery goes well, check back in when you start to heal maybe?

I&#39;m going to tell you what someone told me after my surgery and by god I didn&#39;t believe them but I do now.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still only fresh and needs time to heal. As time goes on its going to look a million times better...
</p>
<p>
That being said it&#39;s looking more anotomicaly correct then mine did at the time. Your going to be very happy.

You can&#39;t say yet 😯 Maybe after 3-4 weeks, but swelling is up to 12 weeks.

My surgeon told me not to judge until 9 months

I think your symmetry looks perfect. You&#39;re swollen but looking from the picture I think your doctor did great with your anesthetics and you&#39;ll have a very perfect pussy soon. Be patient.

You have a good aesthetic, but it is still too early for the final result.
