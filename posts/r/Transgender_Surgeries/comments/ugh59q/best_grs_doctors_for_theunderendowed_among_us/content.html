I’m gonna be blunt, and my Jun sisters have seen my question about this in the discord already, but…
</p>
<p>
I’ve got a small penis.  I’d say three to four inches hard, uncircumcised.  I try and keep “exercising” it to keep it from atrophying too much, but it’s been small my whole life.
</p>
<p>
I was under the impression that PPT was the best for my situation, and that Jun was the best at it right now, but now I’m hearing different and I’m just a little panicked that I’ll never get the vagina I want and.  Idk.  Is there anyone who went in with not a lot to work with and got a result they loved?  What doctors excel working with us lesser-endowed baddies?

Dr Kaoutzanis out of UCHealth in Denver did an amazing job with me! He was trained by BBL

Unrelated to the original question, but I&#39;m curious - what made you choose UChealth? I&#39;ve been trying to find info on them for a while but can&#39;t find much.

Insurance made me stay in Denver or go through a wholeee process to get travel approved.
</p>
<p>
UCHealth is new, but I&#39;ve been going to their integrated transgender clinic for doctors/hormone/psyche checkups for a while now. That&#39;s how I learned about Dr. Kaoutzanis.
</p>
<p>
I consulted with him and learned that he does PPT, and was trained by Dr. Bluebond-Lagner, who is widely regarded as one of the best if not the best bottom surgeon in the country.
</p>
<p>
Dr. K&#39;s only been at it for a few years, so I guess I sorta got in at the ground floor but I am SO impressed with his work.
</p>
<p>
So, overall, UCHealth is a 15 minute drive from my apartment and I was very very impressed by Dr. K&#39;s credentials :) Feel free to ask any other questions!

My recovery&#39;s been amazing! I went back to work after 3 weeks. Pain was noticeable but tolerable. Everything has been healing up amazing, and my surgeon was particularly happy with the healing during my post-op

Suporn. For reals. My &#34;donor material&#34;was about the same length. foreskin intact, no orchi. I&#39;m dilating literally right now, at 18cm (7 inches).

Seconded. One of the other patients who was there when I was had been on HRT since her early teens and was smaller than OP, but still got 14ish cm of depth. Other patients who said were small enough that they didn&#39;t need to tuck reported similar results.

yep,  or Dr Chettawut, their technique uses scrotum skin and a skin graft for depth, so it&#39;s actually a bigger problem for them if you&#39;ve had an Orchi a while ago.

Was about 1.25 inches flaccid, maybe 3 inches hard before surgery, I went with McGinn in PA. I just had my 6 month post op and was told I managed to maintain most/all? of my surgery depth of 6.5 inches.

I was very small before my GRS. I had scrotal graft vaginoplasty in the UK and now have a solid 5.5&#34; depth, just to last dot on the orange dilator. X

I&#39;m gonna give a general recommendation:

Seek Multiple Consultations

and bring this issue up as your principal concern.

I&#39;ve been on HRT for two-plus years, and my penis and testicles have shrunk considerably. I doubt my penis would now measure three inches--not that I care.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m due for bottom surgery a few weeks, and when my surgeons inspected my goods last December, and I heard one of them say &#34;sufficient for surgery.&#34;
</p>
<p>
SO if they can do my surgery with what I have, I&#39;m sure they can do yours with what you&#39;ve got.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!!

I&#39;ve had a lot of struggles the last three weeks with recovery, but the majority were from hemorrhoids. I absolutely love Dr. Del Corral in Baltimore and the staff of the recovery unit are absolutely angels. They went above and beyond to help me and were so compassionate and kind. Do not discount the care you get from med techs, nurses, and even the cleaning staff.  Oh, and Dr. Del Corral is awesome too.
</p>
<p>
Note: I had very little donor material and he does all three methods Penile inversion, Peritoneal Pull through, and Colon (I am not sure exactly what the technical name is.)
</p>
<p>
I had the peritoneal method. He used about an inch of penile tissue as an anchor for the peritoneal tissue.
</p>
<p>
Three weeks in and I highly recommend him and his team.

This is also me, except I&#39;m also circumsized, so yeah... Been told by a suregon that even my pelvis might be too narrow, sigh. But if skin is elastic enough it can be done.   I just am not sure I want to do Sigmoid Colon, the method most recommended to me. It scares me. 😔

Ooooh, that’s good to know!  I wasn’t sure how much soft vs.  erect mattered to end result, so knowing that it’s more about pliability is helpful

Theerapong in Bangkok offers PPT, sigmoid colon, and graft techniques. I had PPT and while I have enough material, he used penile skin only for the external structures and the canal is made from peritoneal, scrotal, and urethral tissue. I had PPT with him and got 6.5&#34; depth with a super easy dilation schedule compared to other surgeons. Just twice daily for 20-30min since hospital release and from week 8 I may go down to once daily. I think reputable Thai surgeons are all used to deal with people who are smaller because locals there are smaller on average than people in USA/Europe.

But they told me there that Thai people are often smaller. I don&#39;t care, don&#39;t think different sizes make for a better penis, and don&#39;t want to offend you, just what I heard and what I believe is also seen in statistics.

I never used the word ethnic, I don&#39;t know what you mean since my original statement is true. As you can see here:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.worlddata.info/average-penissize.php" rel="nofollow">https://www.worlddata.info/average-penissize.php</a>
</p>
<p>
South east asian countries are below 12cm on average erect penis size. Average for all of europe is above 14cm, USA is ~13.6cm, and Canada ~15.7cm.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know whether that makes penis size an ethnic thing or not, but those are the averages. Of course the size is a distribution in all countries. The average being smaller means, assuming a normal distribution, that the relative share of people with a penis size below a particular value x is larger in that region. So surgeons operating regularly on people from SEA countries are used to create a neo-vulva with less tissue on average.
