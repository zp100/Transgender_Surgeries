Glad it is and all I can say is don&#39;t overdo it and don&#39;t be scared if while healing your voice sounds a little deeper than it should. It still amazes me how worn out I still get from talking too much ðŸ˜… good luck with your recovery though x

Literally the first day I spoke I sounded the same I was so unhappy but I know that I need to trust the process because my voice is higher clearly my cords are just inflamed, do you recommend anything to reduce inflammation

My cords were inflamed still after 2 and a half weeks so I after I had a checkup I was prescribed steroids to help reduce it. From what I can hear and feel though doing 2 or 3 steam inhalations really helps, I can still hear a difference if I do it. Other than that I&#39;m not sure what else you can do but I contacted the surgeon and he was more than happy to see me earlier because I thought mine was wrong because it sounded so low.

Yeah that&#39;s fine it&#39;s around Â£4500 just for a glottoplasty, if you email them asking they will send you a breakdown of all the costs x

I&#39;m struggling to not cough, I sometimes feel like I&#39;m gonna drown choking ðŸ˜ž did you ever feel like? I never let out maassive cough or what would feel like a damaging one but, just a small one. Through bodily response to get air past. Did you ever experience this. Cuz im so paranoid I&#39;m going to ruin the healing process. I also had the same doctor by the way ðŸ˜Š

For sure, the struggle not to cough was insanely hard. I must admit I did accidentally do a couple of big coughs and loads and loads of little ones. What helped me was the steam inhalations they always made the need to cough go away for a little bit so maybe try doing that a little more? Hope you have a good recovery though because it is honestly life changing x
