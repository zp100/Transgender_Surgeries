Good luck!  I&#39;ve heard really good things about him, though he&#39;s only done a handful of SRS&#39;s.  Hope it works out for you!

I have faith in him! That’s all any of us can do. You can go to the best and get botched we have to believe that want happen.

I did talk privately to one of the girls who had surgery with him recently - her roommate did too - and she gushes about her experience.  I have a write-up of my consult with Dr. Wittenberg in my post history.  Others who might consider Dr. Selph might find a similar post about him useful, if that&#39;s something you&#39;d be willing to do.
</p>
<p>
When is your surgery?  And congrats again!
</p>
<p>
Edit: I&#39;m also getting PPT, so I&#39;d be interested in following your experiences.
</p>
<p>
Edit #2: I see you already DM&#39;d the same person.

I have a consult with Dr Selph in a few weeks. Have you had your surgery yet?

He seems good. I liked how he explained everything and answered all my questions and addressed my concerns.

Yes, should be happening in February. Waiting on some paperwork at the moment. He’s not in network, so my insurance is having to do the network deficiencies for the facility. They did the deficiency for him for the consult, but didn’t include the facility.
