Well, time does fly! It&#39;s actually amazing how much your body changes and heals over time. I never notice it because I stare at my vagina every day due to dilation, but looking back at old pictures, it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s come a long way.
</p>
<p>
â€‹
</p>
<p>
Anyways, here is how things sit for me!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Overall pain is gone for the most part. I get the odd shock once every few days, and long term sitting (3+ hours) still makes me feel a bit rough, but things are getting much better
</li>
<li>
I&#39;m still pretty swollen. I&#39;ve noticed my body doesn&#39;t like to deal with swelling. Hell, my nose is still a bit swollen 7 months post rhinoplasty. I guess that&#39;s just the way my body is :).
</li>
<li>
Aesthetically, there is still a ways to go.
<ul>
<li>
The good: my labia majora is pretty symmetrical and puffy (I love the puffy look)! Feels like it&#39;s a good base to build off of. Also, he managed to create some sort of labia majora anterior commissure. My labia majoras actually come together above the vagina and slightly below the pubis mons.
</li>
<li>
The bad: Labia Minora? Clitoral hood? Do those things actually exist? My surgeon has always done pretty thin labia minoras (which is what I want), so swelling really, really masks any minora. He is confident it will continue to come in as swelling decreases. If you squint, you can see the beginning of folding next to the clitoris on either side. We will see what happens :D
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Dilation is still coming along. I&#39;m on green at full depth (5&#34;). Been slowly sizing up to orange in the last 10 minutes or so of my dilation. Can&#39;t hit full depth yet (sadddd), but will continue working at it!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The biggest challenge right now is that the location of my introitus is roughly 3/4-1&#34; below the entrance of the vagina. In cis women, it&#39;s not that unusual to have the introitus to be slightly covered by the perineum, but mine is just too far down. This actually makes dilation kinda tough and I have to work the perineum out of the way. I imagine it can also make penetration in the future during sex kinda tough. Something I&#39;m looking to address with my surgeon. I&#39;m anticipating something similar to a scar contracture release during a revision.
</p>
<p>
I also have an appointment next month with a dermatology consult to evaluate laser treatment for the incisions. Incisions are overall getting flatter with silicone, so that&#39;s a big plus!
</p>
<p>
As things stand now, I&#39;m still planning for revision once I&#39;m able to. Really targeting to have a nicely defined, but thin labia minora, partial clitoral hooding, opening up the entrance to make penetration easier, and ideally a labia minora commissure. Overall though, I&#39;m cautiously optimistic as I think my surgeon did a good job laying important foundational groundwork.
