UPDATE 19TH FEB: I woke up one day and the over secretion and its smell had totally disappeared and has stayed like it. There is still a tiny bit of fluid, just enough for lubrication and smells fine I can only presume the initial secretion was lymph fluid seeping from around the sutures.
</p>
<p>
I just had SRS with a peritoneal graft. The surgery went well and everything looks great. However, there&#39;s quite a bit of fluid coming from my neovagina canal and it smells sort of odd. It&#39;s very musty, semi-sweet, really quite strong. It&#39;s not a foul bacterial vaginitis type smell (thank goodness), however it&#39;s not as pleasant, clean and fresh as I envisaged it would be.
</p>
<p>
Hoping to hear from other girls who&#39;ve had PPT/peritoneal graft SRS as to what their experience is.
</p>
<p>
I have been douching with water and also started with diluted betadine, but it is the actual fluid leaking from the peritoneal tissue which has the smell.

If you “just had” it of course it won’t smell fresh and clean! No surgery will. Also, no genitals are ever going to really smell like a bed of roses. I hope you had realistic expectations going into this. Happy healing, but please talk to your doctor as well about a more reasonable timeline for recovery.

Not to sound mean but a real vagina doesn’t smell clean. A few hours after washing it develops a smell. It’s normal to have a scent

Dear
<a href="/u/HiddenStill" rel="nofollow">u/HiddenStill
</a>
,
</p>
<p>
Coming up six weeks. It&#39;s really interesting what I&#39;ve learnt, getting to the bottom of this! Not aware of anyone non-medical trans girl gaining insight into this previously (in relation to SRS)!!!
</p>
<p>
As described in the Peritoneal dialysis wiki article (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_dialysis" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneal_dialysis
</a>
) and the wiki Peritoneum article (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peritoneum
</a>
) the peritoneal tissue utilized (parietal peritoneum) acts as a membrane/interface with the blood (i.e. permits certain substances to traverse through the membrane) - and continues to do so after being used to line a neovagina (as both layers of the tissue are taken in the graft, i.e. &#39;[the] layer of mesothelium which is supported by a thin layer of connective tissue&#39;).
</p>
<p>
The particular fragrance I was asking about in the OP is thus a function of the peritoneal membrane naturally acting to remove waste products from the blood (still flowing through the graft) which are then deposited in the neovagina canal.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s going to be interesting to ascertain if any substances or therapies lead to my blood becoming significantly &#39;cleaner&#39; and thus the fragrance changing. For instance I&#39;m thinking sauna, chlorophyll (via spirulina) and especially sodium bicarbonate (always to be taken on a completely empty tummy).
</p>
<p>
I note in the Peritoneal dialysis page that it mentions the waste fluid from the dialysis (i.e. what has migrated into it through the peritoneal tissue membrane) is a &#39;clear or pale yellow&#39;. The fluid in my neovagina is exactly the same, a sort of soft mellow yellow.

Your still early in recovery. I don&#39;t think you can really say what its going to be like long term based on how it is now.

UPDATE 19TH FEB: I woke up one day and the over secretion and its smell had totally disappeared and has stayed like it ever since. Not even a single day returning. There is still a tiny bit of fluid, just enough for lubrication and smells fine I can only presume the initial secretion was lymph fluid seeping from around the sutures or maybe the peritoneal membrane cleaning meds out of my blood post surgery.
</p>
<p>
Things are now as fresh and clean as I hoped peritoneal SRS would be.

Post-surgery it was explained by the surgeon there will always be a &#39;secretion&#39; from the peritoneal canal - just I hadn&#39;t linked things together as explained above.
</p>
<p>
However, I now comprehend that peritoneal tissue doesn&#39;t secrete, because it&#39;s not a mucus type tissue in any way whatsoever. The &#39;lubrication&#39; which peritoneal graft SRS provides, by default, always has to be a product of blood waste products traversing the peritoneal membrane and ending up in the neovagina canal space.
</p>
<p>
From others who&#39;ve had a peritoneal graft based SRS, I think it will be ascertained that what I&#39;ve explained is nothing to do with still being early in recovery - rather as above, it&#39;s to do with parietal peritoneum membrane acting and doing what a parietal peritoneum membrane naturally does.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing - rather it&#39;s just a factor which hasn&#39;t previously been understood. As per the above comment linked wiki articles, that the parietal peritoneum membrane can be utilized for dialysis (rather than using a traditional kidney dialysis machine), provides a tremendous insight!

Wanted to add that coming up to 8 week mark,  the amount of fluid &#39;secreting&#39; from my neovagina has decreased a lot. This helps a lot re the topic of this thread.
</p>
<p>
Idk if associated but this coincided with me starting wearing a compression garment/belt around my tummy/midrif.
</p>
<p>
The operation seems to have really affected my tummy and bladder function (temporarily) and so it might be the compression garment is helping to support thefunction of these organs. Like flow through my bladder has been much less and so (ironically) my body might have been using the peritoneal membrane in place of kidneys to filter blood and thus exacerbating the issue explained in the OP.

Two things one like two others have said how long ago was this, bc if its anywhere under a year ofc its not gonna smell the best. Two vaginas cis or trans don&#39;t automatically smell good nor should they be tbh as most of that is just sexism to get women to worry more and buy shit they don&#39;t need as you mentioned it doesn&#39;t smell like vaginitis so don&#39;t over think it
