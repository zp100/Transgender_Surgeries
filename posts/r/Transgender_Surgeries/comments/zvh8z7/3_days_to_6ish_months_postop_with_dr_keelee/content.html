Had a penile inversion vaginoplasty with Dr Keelee Macphee in Raleigh in July. im honestly surprised i dont hear about her more because shes absolutely amazing and im insanely happy with my entire experience. not only has she done great work but shes been absolutely amazing with communication and incredibly patient and caring and kind. one of the highlights was easily the hospital she operates at. its a small specialty hospital that just has the most amazing staff and the food is like actually really really good?? i felt so spoiled the short time i was there and almost wanted to go back haha. i was walking comfortably the day of surgery and made incredibly fast progress and was discharged on my third day post-op. i remained in the city for about a week until packing and catheter removal and was sent home with frequent zoom calls to check in. i was also given a direct line for immediate concerns and every time i was worried about something she was always available to explain and help calm my nerves. i was unable to sit for about 2 months but after that things became much easier and i have been comfortable ever since. currently getting all 5 dots with green dilator and im over the moon about that. at 4 months i had my first orgasm and have been able to do so regularly with a bit of effort (currently slowly experimenting with added penetration and it has gone very well). i believe i might have some slightly stunted healing due to needing to take oral steroids for a very severe eczema outbreak but i dont believe that has anything to do with the surgery. dilation schedule has been 3x50min a day with 10 purple 10 blue 30 green (i believe i started with green around 4-5 weeks but its kind of fuzzy) but i expect to be cleared down to 2 during my next follow-up. i will say recovery has been very challenging emotionally, but i dont regret it a single bit and the overall entire experience could not have gone better! a few side details: 23 yrs old, 5 yrs HRT and overall in reasonably good health. id also like to mention that my mom accompanied me every step of the way and we became VERY close over the course of the whole experience. she was my caretaker up until i had regained some autonomy and i couldnt appreciate her more. it was partially insanely awkward and uncomfortable but it was also a very bonding experience and it was very interesting to see how excited she was about the entire process. she actually knew significantly more than i did about the procedure going in and was constantly curious and asking questions and wanting to learn how best she could help. it was also incredibly affirming to see her reactions to the results of my surgery and how excited she was at how good my vagina ended up looking. it feels very bizarre to say because i tend to a more reserved person but i dont regret opening up this boundary in the least. sorry this ended up being a whole rant but if anyone has any questions im more than happy to answer!!

oh also wanted to mention that i was scheduled a lot faster after my consult than i expected. i had my consult in february and booked my surgery for july. i was not required to have any hair removal and there have been no issues in relation to that which i thought was insanely cool

i dont know if id say worse, there wasnt any pain or anything and it closed up just fine, it genuinely looks much scarier than it actually is
</p>
<p>
to add onto this, it resolved on its own with no intervention from my surgeon and it was genuinely fine

I had mine done by her as well (will be two years as of feb 10). Fairly smooth recovery and happy with the results. Her openness to communication really helped a lot. Back when I had the catheter in we were expecting an ice storm and she came into the office specifically on her day off to make sure we could get it removed before the storm froze us in.

It does look like it&#39;s healing really well, congrats! Although my one point of concern, is that in the last picture it looks like your labia minora may have fused just above the vagina. As long as jt doesn&#39;t affect penetration or urinating, it should be fine but it may be an aesthetic concern to talk through with your surgeon if need be.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on the rest of your healing!

Ah OK all good. You have nice, plump labia if you don&#39;t mind me saying so, so things should end up healing nicely

best of luck!
