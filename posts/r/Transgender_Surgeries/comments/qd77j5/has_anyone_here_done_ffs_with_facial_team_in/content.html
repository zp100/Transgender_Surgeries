I&#39;ve heard from a lot of people who did it with facial team Spain on this sub but nothing from their clinic here in Brazil. If you know about this clinic, please share your experience.❤️

I&#39;ve only had one appointment with them about three years ago. They are the same as the Spanish team, if I&#39;m not wrong they were both built at the same time because the main surgeons of each unit are friends and partners, one Brazilian and one Spanish, so they did one unit on each respective country. The prices are lower on the Brazilian unit, but overall the service is the same and sometimes even the surgeon is the same. When I was talking to the surgeon he told me when some jaw work is needed to be done in Brazil they bring one surgeon from the Spanish team and also bring the metal piece from Europe.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say prices are at least six times lower than the Spanish prices, because the Euro-Brazilian Real conversion is insane, about 6 to 1 and increasing and I still have plans on having FFS with them. I just didn&#39;t continue with my appointments with them years before because I thought GRS was more important, so I focused on that and now I&#39;ll wait and see if my health insurance covers FFS here. In theory it should, so I&#39;ll wait and try, but it still may take more than a year. (I&#39;m half Brazilian and live in the same city as the Brazilian clinic. Any other questions I happen to know I can answer them, even some prices, although for sure to be outdated)
