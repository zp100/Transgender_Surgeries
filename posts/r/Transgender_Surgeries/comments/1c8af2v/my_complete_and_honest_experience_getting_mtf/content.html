Fuck, that was incredible. I don&#39;t know what else to say but I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have been able to watch this. I&#39;ve never seen such a detailed experience filmed. It truly showed the reality of post-op recovery in hospital in a way that I haven&#39;t encountered before.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for doing this video. Thank you for the endless hours of putting it together. Thank you for having the courage to show it. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re doing well and I can&#39;t wait to hear how your checkup goes!!

Thank you, I appreciate that so much! That&#39;s exactly what I set out to do and I&#39;m so glad people are watching it despite my channel&#39;s small size.

I really appreciate you making this video. Based on all the results I&#39;ve seen and after hearing your experience, I think I will opt for the full penectomy w/ orchiectomy. A lot of the vaginoplasty results don&#39;t look so great, people have complications, a difficult recovery and they have to dilate regularly.

Yeah that&#39;s totally fair! The dilation is hard but I wanted the chance to have sex as a woman so I&#39;m dealing with it, it totally depends on how much time you have and what you want from the surgery. One of the main benefits of the vulva in general is that I don&#39;t have to worry about a bulge, I can wear tight swimsuits and it feels great!
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best on your journey!

Thank you I appreciate your comment! Yes, it&#39;s definitely a struggle and, as the surgeon said, &#34;if will be the worst few weeks of your life&#34;, so definitely prepare for that.
</p>
<p>
Haha, I&#39;ll tell him you said we&#39;re cute :3

<p>
More videos to come!

First off, congratulations! I have a few questions about your recovery including dilation and depth achieved. The video was great and if you are planning on releasing more videos with the info above then I’ll definitely stay tuned! I hope things are a lot better for you now and that recovery went well
</p>
<p>
It’s really interesting to see somebody the same age go through the same process, I’ll be having surgery with Tina in a few months so definitely want as much info as possible if you’re comfortable in sharing.

Hi, yeah dilation is a bit of a life-changer and people don&#39;t talk about how much work it actually is. Thing is, putting the dilators into the vagina is the
<em>
easy
</em>
part (at least it is for me), it&#39;s all the other stuff before and after that makes it a bit time consuming and messy and not that fun.
</p>
<p>
I might eventually make a video fully about all that I used to have to do and all that I have to do now (because it does get easier as time goes on), ask any specific questions you like but in the meantime I do talk a little bit about dilation in this video:
<a href="https://youtu.be/3_m3Er8vt3U?t=781">https://youtu.be/3_m3Er8vt3U?t=781
</a>
(this links to 13:01) so I&#39;d recommend watching that first. It also includes a bunch of information about the process for getting surgery in the UK too, not sure if you saw it or not

How long did it take from getting the 2nd surgical recommendation to the day of surgery?
