Hi everyone, I’m planning on getting my bottom surgery once I graduate high school which is not to far away to start planning for. I heard from another friend who parent works in the healthcare industry for kaiser and said that if you have kaiser Platinum health plan which means stuff is super cheap and insurance usually covers everything. Which I asked my mom and my friend’s mom and I can get it for a co pay of like fucking 50$.
</p>
<p>
Now bottom surgery is the one thing I want to have the best result and function possible so has anyone had any surgeons from kaiser? Are you pleased with it? How was the experience? If so message me or comment.
</p>

There’s a wiki with the doctors here. Where are you located depends on the sturgeon. I’m in Nor Cal so I would have Dr Simonds or Dr Tong as Dr Ali is focused on FTM

I&#39;m in placer too and just had mine a month ago with Simonds. There is one or two other doctors available in the area but they all practice the same method. Personally my payment was $6k because of insurance through my work but they had assistance program so it all got covered. Honestly I&#39;m happy with his work. Really tho, the only options available through kaiser would be those few and they are located in San Fran. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions!
