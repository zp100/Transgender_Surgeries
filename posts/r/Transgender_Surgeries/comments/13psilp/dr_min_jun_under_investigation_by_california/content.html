Thank you all for your incredible support, this has been a very isolating process and its meant a lot to hear you. Based on your comments and support I moved forward and filed a formal complaint with the Osteopathic Medical Board of California (due to Jun not being an MD). Last week I received notice that they were moving forward with an investigation. I am going to send them my medical releases today and after that they are going to interview Dr. Jun directly based on my complaint. I‚Äôm hoping some good comes out of this, or at the very least he learns that patients are human beings who deserve compassionate medical treatment. Far too often trans people are infantilized by medical professionals and Dr. Jun is a major offender.
</p>
<p>
Since my post I was amazed by the sheer number of people who messaged me with similar stories. Almost all of them were afraid to share publicly due to fear of retaliation by Dr. Jun and the Crane Center. But I think it is important as a community that trans people start fighting back against poor standards of care. If anything has happened to you during the care of this surgeon I hope that you can file a complaint with the same organization I did.
</p>
<p>
File a complaint against Dr. Jun:

Are we talking about the Min Jun that everyone seems to rave about as the best GRS doctor?  Is this why he is leaving Crane Center?  Did he get fired?

Yes same Min Jun, there is an unfortunate trend in our community to hype up doctors especially when they are new

The woman, April, who made this post, loved her vagina with him for months afterwards until Jun said something she didnt like and then she turned on him. She also got banned from the discord. She has main character syndrome. She also complains on other social media sites about her FFS despite getting the best FFS surgeon in the world. This is kind of her shtick. Don&#39;t be surprised if she starts attacking Dr Ley as well within the next 6 months. Dr Jun is really good at his work, look at all the evidence on this site alone.

I loved my FFS and have never complained about it. I also recently posted how awesome Dr. Ley is, she‚Äôs great. Of my surgeons only Min Jun has been an issue. Please do not spread lies about someone you do not know. I was in pain and dealing with complications for many months until I had surgery with Dr. Ley, now everything works.

A DO and an MD are equivalent and both fully trained and licensed physicians. They just graduate from different medical schools. And for the record ANY time someone files a grievance or complaint it is investigated regardless of resolution. If this is supposed to be some sort of gotcha it really isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just standard protocol.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish with any of your posts but it definitely leans towards libel and defamation.

OP is about to find out they literally won‚Äôt do anything to trans gender affirming surgeons if it‚Äôs not blatant malpractice since all these complications and such and needing revisions is considered normal and is almost always blamed on the patients body/aftercare not the surgeon
</p>
<p>
The lie that vaginoplasty is a 1 stage surgery is the real issue IMO. From everything I‚Äôve seen over the years it almost always takes 2-3 surgeries to have what would be considered an excellent top notch result.

I can empathize with you, having a bad experience with something as major as GCS would be hard to deal with. However, I can&#39;t relate. Personally, I have had nothing but a positive experience with Dr. Jun and the entire team with the Crane Center. I hope the situation resolves in a way that is best for everyone.

If he is DO he can perform surgery I believe. DO and MD are both doctors.

I see. We go into surgery knowing the risks. I signed many forms knowing full and well that I could end up with unpleasant complications and results. It‚Äôs always a possibility. I wouldn‚Äôt blame the surgeon. I do wish you a full recovery and hope things go well for you.

You‚Äôre missing the point here. Its his inappropriate and unprofessional behavior that is the main issue and the main content of each complaint. This is a surgeon who is under intense legal pressure and currently has no practice nor ability to take new patients. We could argue about him until the cows come home, but at the end of the day those are the current optics.

Have you done a consult anywhere else?  If you had surgery in Marin County,  are you able to see another surgeon in the Bay Area? Only one I can think of is Dr. Marcie Bowers in Burlingame/San Mateo.  There are others.  Just for an exam and a consult for revisions?  I wish you resolution and peace.
