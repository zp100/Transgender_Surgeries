kind of silly they simply told you not to move your legs, would have been easier to simply tie them up so that you don&#39;t have to worry.

Hey congrats for the surgery and don&#39;t worry about the blood every body I guess heals differently. Wanna ask you I was also considering dr kaushik for srs but for his sigma lead technique, why you chose the only PI technique over others? And I think he also performs PPT as well. And what was the total cost of it?

The only difference is the cost n the depth, ppt results r good as well of him...  But as I see u had an orchie in the past I&#39;ll suggest u to go for sigmoid colon one.

I‚Äôm a big fan of their sigma lead srs. I‚Äôm curious why you went with their PI method? And what the functionality and aesthetic differences are?

The sigma lead is great, but PI for me was cost effective..  The only difference is in depth, nothing else
