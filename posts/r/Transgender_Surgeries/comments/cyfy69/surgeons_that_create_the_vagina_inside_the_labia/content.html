So I have been researching results of various doctors and looking into who I might want to go with in the end for my srs.. I recently(6 months hrt) started my transition so I have quite a lot of time to make a decision (Im a &#34;no research is enough&#34; kinda person) . The results that I have been looking at range from indistinguishable from cis to really really bad.. So I am looking for a surgeon who creates the most aesthetic vaginas.. For me that means creating both labia majora and minora.. The urethra and vagina both should be inside labia minora.. and create a clitoris and hood. I know it is a YMMV heavy subject but I am looking for a surgeon with good track record at making both visually and functionally aesthetic vaginas.

The Suporn Clinic does this, but you would probably require a revision to get the labia minora to &#34;meet&#34; at the bottom of the vaginal opening.
</p>
<p>
From what I&#39;m told it&#39;s basically impossible to do in one stage because of all the dilation you need to do, you would just rip it open, so you have to get some time in before getting a revision to get them together. They call this the posterior commissure. Also popular is The anterior commissure, which is the labia majora meeting at a point at the top of the vulva. Most of the time they don&#39;t meet as closely as a cisgender vulva because of tissue thickness in the first surgery.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s what drew me to The Suporn Clinic. They build all the parts and pieces, so you have all the bits. Some surgeons leave out the labia minora and clitoral hood for whatever reason.

I had SRS at the Suporn clinic. It is definitely up there with regards to aesthetics which is why I chose it. A few clarifications though. They really only like to do the posterior commissure if you have a very wide opening near the vagina. They are willing to work with you though if you feel strongly. There is a 50% separation rate with that procedure which is why they prefer not to do it unless really needed.
</p>
<p>
The anterior commissure makes a biiig difference in aesthetics (at least it did for me) but it still doesn&#39;t quite look quite as narrow as most cis vaginas. Still, totally worth it as the recovery is quite mild.

I should have mentioned that, the posterior commissure is something he (Dr. Suporn) talks just about everyone out of. Lot of the women I was with wanted posterior commissure, no one ended up getting one. Almost all of them got anterior commissure, urethral tissue reduction, and some got clitoris reconstruction (apparently because he buries so much clitoris [as it should be] this is actually one of the easier revisions)
</p>
<p>
I would assume Dr. Bank will act about the same way with his patients. I had primary with Dr. Bank, so I haven&#39;t seen him to talk about a revision being it&#39;s too early to think about being less than two months post op.

I wonder how likely they will accept it for a second revision?

I think regardless of when you get it, it has a pretty high failure rate. I think the main issue is the tissue there is just not as elastic as it needs to be to facilitate using your vagina. It&#39;s just really easy to tear, so he discouraged it because you could get it, have it look awesome and heal great, then 6 months later tear it having sex.

I&#39;m curious, are you happy with the urethral tissue reduction? I still have a bit more left than I was hoping. It doesn&#39;t stick out of my labia anymore, but it is pretty noticeable when I&#39;m aroused.

I haven&#39;t had a revision, I was talking about women I was with when I got primary. I haven&#39;t really been really aroused yet to see if I need  a urethral tissue reduction. Right now it looks like I
<strong>
might
</strong>
not need it, but I&#39;ll be going back for a few other things so I&#39;ll see then

Does the colon method make any difference there? Since technically they will have more skin to work with that way.

I would imagine it would, because you would have all your tissue to use on t exterior anatomy, but from what I&#39;m told colon vaginoplasty isn&#39;t ideal because the quantity of discharge is so much that you can never really go without a pad ever, which is less than ideal. It is much easier to dilate and can provide great depth that won&#39;t shorten if you do dilate often because of the type of tissue. Not every surgeon does the colon vaginoplasty and so you might want to consider if going to any of them will provide the aesthetics that you&#39;re looking for. No sense in colon method if the extra material isn&#39;t being put to good use.

I think I&#39;ve heard of two-stage surgeries being able to do that. I don&#39;t really know who does that, but that might be something to look for.
