So it’s day 15. Dilation is doing okay as expected discomfort but nothing more. When I’m done dilating a bunch of lube and discharge come out and I can’t handle the smell. It makes me want to puke. Doctor said that this is normal that it’ll go away in a few weeks as the vagina heals.
</p>
<p>
Any ladies have tips on how to help with this? I’m so self conscious about the smell. It’s causing me to really be upset during dilation, hell during urination when my oad has the odor. I looked online and see that a “cheese smell” is common after but I don’t know how I’m going to manage. It makes me want to throw up
</p>
<p>
Any advice or words of encouragement will help. I knew surgery was going to be long but this is really impacting me

Wear a mask and chew gum while you dilate. You won’t smell anything.

I assume you douche after each dilation. Soap in douche? I jus used salt water and seemed ok.
</p>
<p>
Used to not be able to get all the douche liquid  back out. Now, when I have emptied the bulb, I allow it to expand a little as I withdraw the nozzle and it sucks up any internal leftovers.

I have to douche with iodine water solution and the plain water. I assume the idiots could be causing some smell but I am following doctors orders. I know it’s only 2 weeks and have to trust it’ll get better. I wish I could push a fast forward button and be ready done but as I’ve been told wish in one hand and shit in the other. I just expected 2 weeks to be much better n I guess it’ll take longer

Ginger helps with nausea, mints clear the head too. It is somewhat normal and rough to go through, but I would trust what your doctor says.
</p>
<p>
I’ve read anecdotal stories saying that cleaning it too rigorously can be bad and make bacteria and smell worse. Not sure if that’s true, as I’m still having minor issues, but it’s something to keep in mind.

Did you get colon vaginoplasty? It’s common with that and will go away. How did everything else go with the surgery?

Maybe ask your surgeon for some anti nausea medication? Smells are all over the place early on, but dilation is super important. Also maybe experiment with different painkillers, those can also cause nausea in my experience.
