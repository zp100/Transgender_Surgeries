i was told by my surgeon you should anticipate complete hair loss around the incision and not panic because shock hair loss will 100% grow back. i’m so sorry you’re going through this! be strong.

Thanks so much! Yah, my surgeon said the same thing and I was expecting that (although hoping for the best). I think what caught me off guard is that its actually my whole head :(. I wish I were exaggerating when I say that the entire backside of my head is now bald and the sides and top seem to be going that way too, just slower. It seems like I may have been especially sensitive to some part of the process and time is the only solution though... sigh...
</p>
<p>
Thanks again!

Thanks so much for the support, it truly means a lot &lt;3. Yah I think it&#39;s mainly the shock loss, having levels checked soon just in case though.

Thank you for the link. I have definitely read through these and that section of the wiki. I know that this is not an unexpected experience, but just wanted to reach out to the community to see what others experiences were.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think the extent was under sold a bit (not that I would have done anything differently necessarily), but I also think it would be nice to have some more experiences like mine noted if they are not super rare.
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for the link though.
