I had robot-assisted peritoneal pull through (PPT) penile inversion vaginoplasty (etc.) with Dr. Selph about 6 months ago (mid June). He is an up-and-coming surgeon at UAB in Birmingham, AL. He is a reconstructive urologist by training.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll quickly run through the major events involved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
5 day hospital stay. Got a mild respiratory infection (not COVID!) while I was there, eventually cleared it up about 3 weeks post op.
</li>
<li>
Had suture failure at around 2 weeks post-op. This happened near the bottom area, by the perenium and on the left side a bit. Dr. Selph tried office stitches for 2 weeks, but that wasn&#39;t working great so I went back under for minor repair at the 4-week post-op marker. Things healed up just fine after that. This is apparently pretty common. I was also overzealous on dilator size, which likely contributed (I didn&#39;t understand which dilator I was supposed to be using). You can see where this is healing up just a bit behind everything else, with that white-ish splotch of skin right on the perenium.
</li>
<li>
Dilation depth was around 11-11.5 cm for the first 3 months or so. I think there was some swelling or something going on in the back. Around 4 months post op I seemed to slowly gain back a bit of depth. Currently reaching 12-12.5 cm (morning dilation is harder, evening dilation is easier). I did not start with a lot of tissue either. I would guess the danger-noodle was rather below average (I didn&#39;t take any pre-op photos).
</li>
<li>
I still produce a fair amount of yellowish-brownish discharge. Sometimes with a touch of blood, especially on the tip of the dilator. I&#39;m guessing internal granulation near the back. I&#39;ve also heard this is maybe common with PPT? Not sure.
</li>
<li>
Urine stream was all over the place for the first 3-4 months. At 4 months Dr. Selph used some silver nitrate to take care of some granulation near the urethra. After that urine stream is relatively stable (I&#39;m not spraying the front of the seat anymore).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My insurance (BCBS-AL) covered everything without issue. I just needed the standard WPATH letters.
</p>
<p>
Overall I&#39;m very happy with how things have turned out! Aesthetically I&#39;m pretty happy with how things are healing. Having a local surgeon in Alabama is also a godsend. Dr. Selph is very easy to get in contact with. Also the nurses at the post-op hospital stay are all amazing, and super nice!
</p>
<p>
Feel free to send me questions on this thread or DM them to me!
</p>
<p>
Edit: Forgot some other things I wanted to mention
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I&#39;m pretty sure I was either his 5th or 6th surgery. He&#39;s done a few more now after our batch.
</li>
<li>
There was a team from Chicago also assisting on the surgery, training some of the other doctors at UAB on the procedure. I can&#39;t remember the doctor&#39;s name from that group. It was Dr. K-something, eastern European sounding name.
</li>
<li>
I did not do any hair removal pre-op. I didn&#39;t have a ton of hair in the &#34;bad spots&#34; anyways. I don&#39;t see any bad regrowth so far, but also I don&#39;t see very well so I probably couldn&#39;t tell on my own anyways.
</li>
</ul>

Reconstructive urologists are becoming popular with GCS. We have a new one in Louisville who is getting some good results (as heard through the grapevine) and does revisions.

I&#39;m glad too. At the very least I knew that I would have a low risk of urinary complications given his specialization.

Indeed, my electrologist has told me three of her clients have had surgery our new surgeon and one was for urethral correction. Everyone is highly impressed and his reconstruction work is going to make him a name.

I&#39;m doing well, almost at the 1 year mark now. No real troubles other than a tiny patch of very stubborn granulation.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re scheduled for a consult or surgery in August? Are you going with Selph or someone else?

Oh nice!
</p>
<p>
Btw if you&#39;re interested there&#39;s a whole group of us on discord who have had surgery with him. There&#39;s about 10-12 of us who have done surgery with him, and probably another dozen planning to.
