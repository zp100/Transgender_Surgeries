First week is

</p>
<p>
Second week is
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/pnjhqg/grs_2_week_follow_up_surgeon_dr_klemenz_team/">here</a>
</p>
<p>
Pictures for week 3 are
<a href="https://lensdump.com/a/9nH85/?sort=date_asc&amp;page=1">here</a>
also includes a pic from my dilation set, so you can see which ones I am using
</p>
<p>
So then let&#39;s get into the 3rd week, and yes I am still in hospital.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 15
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since it&#39;s kinda good looking I shall reduce the cooling, From 3 times a day to 1 times a day. And I only can start HRT again if all looks good. (30 days without at that point).
</p>
<p>
Since it&#39;s so good looking I am able to start dilating soon.
</p>
<p>
Also I am really happy at this point and am really glad that I&#39;ve did this surgery even with my complications.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 16
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Was on the gynecological chair with my dilation set and have started with the 2nd one. This one got in very very easy and without any problems. After that douching again and the doctor asked me if I wanted to try the number 3 cause it also should fit and yes it fits, tight but fits.
</p>
<p>
In the evening I&#39;ve did it alone, first with the 2nd one then with the 3rd one.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 17
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When I am able to get out of hospital can&#39;t be said right now, cause the hematoma is still to problematic.  Dilation in the morning with No 3 was ok, even worked without using a smaller one first. On the gynecological chair more self-disolving thread got removed cause they were pretty pointless at this point and fibrin covering were worn away (hope this one makes any sense üôà)
</p>
<p>
Hematoma looks good, but I&#39;ve got another problem on the top of my vagina.
</p>
<p>
Dilation in the evening again only with 3, was a little bit more tight then in the morning but it worked.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 18
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Couldn&#39;t dilate cause had to get on the gynecological chair first üòÖ on the top of my vagina I had some necrotic tissue that got removed. Now i have to stop dilation at least for today and shall see how I can handle it tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
And tomorrow will be the first time were I hadn&#39;t have to go on to the gynecological chair since day 5
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 19
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Antibiotics stop. Dilation in the morning? To painful. I shall use the gel I&#39;ve got for healing.
</p>
<p>
This was a hard pushback mental wise.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 20
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Again gynecological chair and according to the Assistent doc that made the visit I also shall bring my dilation set so they can show me how it works. (As if I didn&#39;t know it just hurts)
</p>
<p>
Since another assistant doc was then there I haven&#39;t taken the set with me. He just have douched my vagina and said it all looks good, especially cause he haven&#39;t seen me for over a week üòÖ. Also dilation stop for today.  And cause of my slight incontinence I shouldn&#39;t be worried. He said there are good chances it will go away with time. (Hasn&#39;t had incontinence before surgery)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 21
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Again on the gynecological chair and this time again with dilation set. üòê
</p>
<p>
The doc that was there today was kinda irritated with how my body works apparently. She wasn&#39;t able to really locate the place on the top of my vagina so she could see it, she was irritated that I have no problem if she spread me more open in the back, despite having pain in the front, she is irritated that my healing problem perineum doesn&#39;t cause any problem while dilating and she was irritated cause my incontinence is more like I can&#39;t hold it before I go to the toilet. (I have 0 clue why she was so irritated with all of this)
</p>
<p>
I shall dilate with No 1 in the evening and maybe go higher tomorrow. Also I have to stay in the hospital and am still under observation cause of this one problem and that I&#39;m not really dilating right now.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t asked about HRT again, cause they can&#39;t inject it, cause my medication isn&#39;t approved in Germany.  In the evening I&#39;ve dilated again, first with 1 then with 2. Some slight discomfort but no pain. Also I have the feeling I lost some depth within these days.
</p>
<p>
So this was the 3rd week in hospital.
</p>
<p>
Again if you have any questions just ask.
</p>
<p>
Also I hope you can understand this, I had more problem writing this one in then with the other 2
