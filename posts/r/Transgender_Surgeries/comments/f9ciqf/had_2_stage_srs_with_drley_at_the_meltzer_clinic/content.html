Had 2 visits to the meltzer clinic over a 4 month period first was stage1 and ba and 2nd wa stage 2 after a period of healing.  Dr.Ley seems seems like a pretty good surgeon even if her association with the meltzer clinic is unfortunate. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about pretty much anything.

I am quite happy with my results.

Great end result! 3.5 months seems extremely quick to do a second stage. Was the schedule planned this way?

You only have to wait 3 months minimum. I had personal reasons that I needed to hurry. It probably would have been better to wait. But I knew I could handle it.

It turned out beautiful in the end! Did you use ice packs during the healing to help with swelling?

For weeks. Honestly the ice usually helped pain more than drugs. It didnt really like cumulatively help the swelling but in the moment it felt better. I think it was more waiting for my body to reabsorb all the blood and stuff in there.

PSA regarding ice packs. Use with care and a stopwatch. I ended up losing most of my inner labia to necrosis and while I can‚Äôt say for certain ice packs were the cause, blood flow to that area is really good and labia necrosis is really rare. High likelihood of causation.

Omg thank you for the warning. Did that cause you long term issue other than cosmetic? Was it correctable? Either way it sounds painful and terrifying üò¢

There was solid crying for two straight weeks. Not sure yet - happened in December. I‚Äôm guessing largely cosmetic. Surgeon wants to do a third round to correct it (I did a 2-stage), but I need time before going through that again. The first two were rough for me - I am not a good healer.

I also lost most of my inner labia. My surgeon said she pulled everything super tight so that may have had something to do with it, plus my labia looked pretty grey pretty shortly after surgery, but id imagine over use of ice after removing the packing definitely didn&#39;t help my already struggling bits. My nurses basically had me on ice more often than not on it after we removed the packing.
</p>
<p>
Moral of the story. My shit was struggling already, but the ice probably didnt help.

I&#39;ll bite. Blood drains were out on day 2.  I wasnt off work for that whole time first one was about a month and the 2nd was 3 days. And the stitches burst because I had a hematoma a known complication of surgery that your doctor should have went over as a possibility when you talked about the risks of the procedure. 2 step isnt ideal but it&#39;s all insurance would pay for. It is nice because it has a built in revision if anything went wrong or needed tweaked. Maybe cool it on the judgment miss prime tran.

Well your comment wasn‚Äôt a critique of the technique let‚Äôs just set that straight. Also you making assumptions about my history with medical procedures is not only rude but highly offensive. So much for lifting up your felling sisters and speaking positivity into each other.
</p>
<p>
Most ppl choose the surgeon they choose after much research and weighting the pros and cons. Just because you chose what worked for you doesn‚Äôt mean someone else‚Äôs choice for whatever reason ms they had was poor. Also commenting on it after someone‚Äôs already the procedure seems a bit pointless don‚Äôt you think? Not really helpful at all.

And you are entitled to that opinion... because that‚Äôs what it is, opinion. I won‚Äôt sit here and argue with someone who‚Äôs clearly is so self absorbed they can‚Äôt see or acknowledge the difference of fact over opinion. Some women who have a higher risk of complication might find the 2 step procedure better as they know a revision will occurs if anything happens after the first surgery.  You have a blessed day full of light and warmth. üß°
