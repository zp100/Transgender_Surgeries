Labia minora becoming more pronounced as swelling decreased. Sensitivity in vagina and clitoris are AMAZING and building. I had an orgasm the other day in the shower, was completely on accident. Water just hit the right poi t long enough, it set off some pent up tension... It felt good, I could feel the vaginal muscles pulse, and it left my clit all tingly and happy. My nerve pain is getting slowly better, but is improving. I missed dilating a couple times on accident, due to meds causing sudden bouts of falling asleep randomly... but thankfully,  I&#39;m back on track with no new issues. Vaginal canal is healing from the small graft rejection, and is still raw on occasion, and bleeds a little every so often, but it&#39;s getting covered, and healing well. Overall? New pussy? She gets a 10/10

What method was used? This doesnâ€™t look like penile inversion. Is it??  It looks amazing!!! Your clitoral hood is a work of art.

Dr. Freet did me right. :) I&#39;m trying not to directly mention him so much anymore, I don&#39;t wanna be mistaken for any skitty of advertising. But I love my results.
