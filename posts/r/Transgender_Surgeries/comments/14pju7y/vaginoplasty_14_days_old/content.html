So the black tissue is either scab or eschar(dead tissue).  The dead tissue will eventually come off and  will probably have healthy tissue(granulation tissue) underneith it that will probably need to build the area up again, though usually without any major issues cosmetically.  Also, pretty normal for a lot of people.
</p>

I just had SRS 3 wks ago with similar issues and once the dark stuff came off, tannish fibrin/slough filled in and now its starting to look like pink healthy tissue with the edges looking perfectly normal.  My surgeon recommended damp sterile gauze covered by an absorbant dry pad (too damp of gauze on healthy tissue isnt good either) on the raw/healing tissues to remove the escar/slough as that can heal up the area faster.  That type of healing vs stitched areas is a tad slower.  Hope that helps! (Source:healthcare provider and had recent SRS myself). Also, follow the instructions by your surgeon too!

Thank you. That’s reassuring. Just didn’t expect it to still be so black! Yes it was :3
