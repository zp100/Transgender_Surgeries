Taking the packing and drains out didn’t bother me at all, but the catheter felt real weird coming out. Overall quick and easy process. No dilating yet, Gast doesn’t have you start dilations until your first pre-op appointment. How I feel about that is yet to be determined.
</p>
<p>
Pretty mild pain overall. I was taking ibuprofen and Tylenol every six hours, and I was taking 15 mg morphine each night. I didn’t really need the morphine for the pain, but they offered it and it helped me fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
Fairly swollen and not the prettiest, but it’s early days. Everything is healing well with no complications. Gast said my clit looked “happy,” which was good to hear.
</p>
<p>
Peed on my own for the first time which was nice. The stream went everywhere and absolutely soaked my butt, but that’s to be expected due to the swelling. Received peri bottles and a large syringe with a long rubber catheter and learned how to clean the outside and inside of my vagina respectively. Both the peri bottles and syringe/catheter were, I felt, subpar pieces of equipment, and I had already purchased a different set of peri bottles and a douche/enema kit (has a big red bag, found at most drug stores) that were already waiting back at my home. They also gave me a few pairs of mesh/gauze undies, and a few bottles of Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo.
</p>
<p>
Left the hospital the same day this was taken, was walking slow but had no problem walking through the hospital and up several flights of stairs in the parking garage. Much more mobile than I thought I would be.

I dilated on day 5 in the hospital at NYU (with surgilube). like 15 minutes after wound packing came out. I&#39;m wondering how dilating so late doesn&#39;t affect depth

That’s my concern as well. We’ll see how it goes. The first time you dilated, did you hit the depth that your surgeon said was available?

<p>
also try to d/c opiates if you don&#39;t need it for pain because it will slow down healing

Thanks so much! In your experience, did waiting effect it at all? Are you able to hit the depth your surgeon told you you had right after surgery?

I had to dilate 4 times a day for 8 weeks immediately after packing was out per orders of Dr. Min Jun. It’s the most important time to dilate he says. A year later and I still have all my depth and dilating is every few days or less.
