I was finally given a diagnosis of why I am in so much pain and bleeding daily despite being 11 months post-op.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Neuropathy as a result of the pain from (my)your complications&#34; -M.D.
</p>
<p>
I was given 3 prescriptions in an effort to &#34;cut the nerves off and allow them to stop firing at every given opportunity in hopes that when (i)you stop taking these medications the pain will not come back&#34;
</p>
<p>
The 3 medications are:  Amitriptyline 50mg nightly before dilating 10mg Vaginal Suppository Diazepam  100000unit/g Nystatin
</p>
<p>
In the 4 days I&#39;ve been on these medications my symptoms have begun to go down. I am not bleeding anymore, the cramps and &#34;charlie horses&#34; have entirely stopped, and I have had significantly less yucky smelly green discharge.
</p>

Hopefully things will continue to get better from here. I&#39;ll post another update in 4 weeks if this ends up being a solid solution to the mess that KU Medical has put me in.

Glad you&#39;re getting some relief. I don&#39;t know much about this condition. Please get better permanently!

Thank you &lt;3 the goal since September 18th, 2019 has been to heal and recover and I think I might finally be on that path.

I hope that the meds continue to work and you can heal properly.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m curious about the nystatin, as that&#39;s an anti-fungal used for treating external skin when in a topical form.
</p>
<p>
Did you have an issue with an external yeast infection in addition to your complications and everything? Or is it a precautionary measure to make sure you don&#39;t get a yeast infection while you continue to heal up so it doesn&#39;t set you back?

Thank you, I appreciate the well wishes. She prescribed it because I have scar tissue on my perineum that she believes is causing discomfort, she said it grows skin back in some instances and can help with the healing process. I have been having issues with some sort of gross bacteria this whole time that smells and burns that has gone down significantly on this med even though none of the ones my surgeon prescribed helped.

It&#39;s also used as an anti fungal internally too.
</p>
<p>
Quite effective at stepping on it when clotrimazole doesn&#39;t work.
