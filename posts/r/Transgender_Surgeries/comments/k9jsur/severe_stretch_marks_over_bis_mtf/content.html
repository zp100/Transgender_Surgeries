I had your exact problem. My advice is to stop using bio oil and vitamin e. I used those and it just got worse. Just moisturize your skin with gentle lotions and do the hardest thing; wait. I’m about 1.5-ish years post op and my stretch marks are hardly visible

Stretch marks are almost guaranteed when it comes to breast implants because the skin is instantly stretch out. Keep the skin moisturised and they’ll eventually fade.

I was more asking how people cope with it and if there are any solutions aside from the typical vitamin E or bio oil.

...post op there is nothing the surgeon could have done for this, some people are more likely than others to develop stretch marks as well, even from simple weight gain...did you discuss with her about sizing and what she felt was appropriate?...did you already have that size or some other size in mind before going in?...560 is a bit on the larger side but for over the muscle it is not considered huge by any means...sounds like this is a fairly recent procedure, i am sure over some time they should fade and be very less noticeable...good luck!...   :)
