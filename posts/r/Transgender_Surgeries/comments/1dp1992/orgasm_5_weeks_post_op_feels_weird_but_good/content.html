There shouldn’t be any fluid coming out of your clitoris. Since your prostate is still intact and is now basically a “g-spot” it can excrete fluid through your urethra while you are turned on. During surgery your urethra and penile gland are separated. Since you can’t see anything yet, your mind might not have adjusted to the fact that they are no longer together and it might be a kind of phantom sensation.

My suggestion is that since you can&#39;t see anything, I suggest your mind is simply remembering how it felt to orgasm with male genitalia, and is yet to get used to the new configuration of tissues
