Title pretty much says it all. I had penile inversion vaginoplasty 10 months ago. For most of that time, I have been dealing with granulation tissue. There&#39;s a chunk on top of my clitoris, plus always bleeding when I dilate, which my surgeon has told me is due to internal granulation. The first time I came in with it, my surgeon excised it and treated with silver nitrate. It came back after a couple weeks. After that, I visited my surgeon every month or two, same treatment, same result. The last time was in March, at the 8 month mark. Of course it&#39;s back and bigger than ever, but it&#39;s tough to get any appointment with the quarantine. It&#39;s hard to even see the point anymore. It always comes back. It sucks so much. Each time my surgeon acts surprised that it&#39;s there, and talks to me like it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve had it, and like a one time treatment will fix everything. If I remind her that we&#39;ve done this many times, she mentions that sometimes surgery is necessary. I feel like I&#39;m going insane. Am I really some weird freak granulation case? Has anyone been in my shoes with this?

Thank you for this. Honestly it is such a relief knowing there was someone else in my same position and everything worked out okay, that alone means the world to me. I will ask about the steroid cream. Thank you.

What lube are you using? I had granulation tissue for most of my first year. It turned out that the KY Jelly I was using has a very caustic ph level and I didn’t respond well to it. Once I switch to a better lube, the silver nitrate treatment worked and things healed up just fine.

I do use KY :(. I switched to Slippery Stuff for a month or so at the recommendation of a pelvic PT, but it&#39;s so much more runny and less solid than KY that it left a puddle every time I dilated. I couldn&#39;t stand the mess and switched back. I don&#39;t think my bleeding decreased at all during that month, but maybe I didn&#39;t use it long enough.

I have a limited budget and I have a growing collection of almost-full lube bottles in my nightstand, so I&#39;m triggered.

I had just had the tissue cauterized just after switching away from KY and it healed right up. That was after trying to get rid of it for a year.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a fan of Slippery Stuff for long term use either. My favorite is called Sutil Rich. It’s amazing stuff, but spendy.

Sulti lube sounds great just wondering would it be safe to use with granulation with all these added additives? Ingredients Aqua, Propanediol
<em>
(Zamea, botanical source), Hyaluronic Acid (Botanical source), Nelumbo Nucifera Root Extract
</em>
(Lotus Root), Epimedium Sagittatum (Horny Goat Weed) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Gluconolactone*,

Have you tried medi‐honey and a cortisone cream?  My surgeon recommended that if I developed granulation tissue during the quarantine, since I traveled halfway across the country for surgery.  I was five months post op yesterday and I&#39;ve been lucky so far.

Appreciate the advice but if my surgeon tells me &#34;try using some medi-honey&#34; one more time I will jump out a window.

I&#39;ve gone through 2 tubes.

Would either of the two of you be willing to share thoughts, tips, hints, etc about any surgeons you know that might rhyme with Glitterberg?  I am scheduled for July.

I have the same problem near my urethra. My doctor told me they can’t treat it with silver nitrate due to the fact of being there.
