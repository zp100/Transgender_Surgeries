Hi!
</p>
<p>
I just got back from mtf SRS with Dr Chettawut in Bangkok, Thailand, and while I was there I wrote a pretty extensive guide to the whole experience. I hope it&#39;s useful to people who would like to get a detailed understanding of what SRS is like, and particularly anyone considering Dr Chettawut- although I think there is a lot of shared experience with anyone who will have SRS.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
I hope the guide is useful, please feel free to leave comments on the document itself if you have questions or thoughts. I&#39;ll leave comments open for as long as possible (until it gets abused!).
</p>
<p>
Thanks and good luck! Jenna.

Jenna! Thank you so much for this. I can&#39;t believe how awesome this guide is. I&#39;m going on my own  but now I feel way less anxious knowing how to prepare myself. I never thought I&#39;d find such an informative guide containing even ideal gegets and supplies to help make things easier. You&#39;re genious and really thoughful. Thanks again and hope you&#39;re more than happy with your results and life ‚ô•Ô∏è

This is a delayed thank to you OP
<a href="/u/appositeit" rel="nofollow">u/appositeit
</a>
!!!
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for this! I discovered your post and Google doc about three months before my SRS with Dr Chettawut at WIH Hospital.  I cannot stress how helpful and useful it was.  Your effort made a huge impact for me.  The surgery went so well and I had no complications or UTIs.  I am very, very pleased with my results.
</p>
<p>
Now I‚Äôm 14 months post-op and I tend to comment and help others out who are seeking surgery (it‚Äôs a great activity to do during dilation, lol!) üòÅ
</p>
<p>
But I have sent countless women to this post and the link to your document.  I tell them it‚Äôs the ‚Äògold standard manual‚Äô.  So who knows how many people you‚Äôve helped - just through helping me alone!!
</p>
<p>
I hope you are doing well and loving life as much as I am.  Best wishes, and again - thank you so very much for this.  üíñüåüüå∏

May I know if you got colon or skin-graft SRS?

Colon. I initially went with the expectation of doing a skin-graft, partially because my BMI was 31 which is above the permitted BMI of 28. But during my consultation with Dr Chettawut he said he thought the colonoscopy team could do it. We talked through the reasoning between the two options and in the end it seemed to that the colon graft is just tougher and more durable than a skin graft. It may be overkill? But in any case, I don&#39;t regret my choice! :)

Hey thank you. May I ask if you&#39;re concerned of the long term risks of removing part of your bowel?

No, really not. My Dad had bowel cancer and they removed some horrifying length of bowel and... it&#39;s fine. A quick Google search says &#34;Together your small and large intestines are about 15 feet or more in length.&#34; They are taking a very short length, so length loss is no problem.
</p>
<p>
IMO, if you get past any immediate post-surgical risks (leakage, primarily infection), then your risks shrink to something very small. I&#39;m no surgeon, but... humans are leaky, crazy self-repairing death machines. Taking a small section of bowel is barely compares with everything else humans do and survive without any significant impairment. (Basically bowels are well protected my muscle walls so they just need to be a pipe, so if the pipe holds, we&#39;re done.)

Bodyweight is such an invidious problem, and welcome to womanhood, it just gets worse!
</p>
<p>
I just moved into my own place after separating, and now I&#39;m shedding weight like crazy. Turns out that if you get out a stressful situation and have control of your life losing weight gets MUCH easier.
</p>
<p>
I feel like carrying weight carries this invidious assumption that it&#39;s moral failing. Like, somehow, it&#39;s because you don&#39;t have self-control or you are a bad person. That&#39;s complete horsepucky. What it usually means is that you have way too much going on in your life, and you simply can&#39;t make weight loss the thing you expend your precious willpower on.
</p>
<p>
Look at it this way: if you were a big film star and your whole job was to look good, and you were generously paid to do so, you&#39;d have a dietician and chef and personal trainer and doctor, and you could spend your days resting, exercising and getting into shape. You&#39;d be
<em>
paid
</em>
to get into shape. Could you lose weight in this scenario? Heck yes! Of course you could! So why don&#39;t you in your day-to-day life? Because you have other shit going on! Because, for all the frustration it makes you feel, it&#39;s not the thing you can afford to spend your time on because it
<em>
costs
</em>
you time and money.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll be fine. BMI isn&#39;t a showstopper. You&#39;ll work it out.

Congratulations, and nice work on the document. I liked the diy stuff in particular.

You mentioned anti-depressants - mixing Tramadol and SSRI&#39;s can be fatal.

Hi Jenna.  Hopefully, you&#39;re still following this thread.  I have just payed my deposit to WIH for SRS in March next year.  I have been communicating via email to
<a href="mailto:info@wihhospital.com" rel="nofollow">info@wihhospital.com
</a>
.  Is this the correct email?  I am getting nervous as I sent my deposit via international bank transfer to the details they provided.  It&#39;s been 5 days since I sent the transfer and they still haven&#39;t acknowledged receipt of payment yet.  I know I&#39;m probably worrying over nothing, but it&#39;s a lot of money and I&#39;m starting to panic that it&#39;s a scam. Xx

I&#39;m so sorry for the delay in replying, I&#39;m a very infrequent reddit user. I hope this was all sorted out. For what its worth that&#39;s the right email address and it&#39;s not a scam, but then if I were a scammer that&#39;s what I&#39;d say!
</p>
<p>
Verifying anything is real on the internet is hard but generally here&#39;s some useful things I&#39;d do: * The hospital premises can be verified in Google Maps, Chettawutt has enough of a footprint on Google and publications in real journals that he&#39;s a real thing, as is WIH Hospital. So the only real question is, is
<a href="mailto:info@wihhospital.com" rel="nofollow">info@wihhospital.com
</a>
the real contact point? * Google search WIH Hospital and get a contact number, then Google that number and see if it gets a lot of hits from a variety of different places. Doing this for WIH gets me &#34;+66 2 078 8919&#34; in a Google business listing. That&#39;s very good- Google does a lot to verify business details precisely to avoid scamming, and the number is linked on quite a lot of websites with WIH Hospital. So I&#39;d be pretty confident that number is correct. Now, call them and verify the contact email address. * Google search for the email address. In this case
<a href="mailto:info@wihhospital.com" rel="nofollow">info@wihhospital.com
</a>
gets about 486 hits on a wide variety of websites with results that date back a long time, including user submissions on Reddit dating back years. Oddly enough, Reddit is a pretty good source of information because spammers/scammers tend to get called out by other users but don&#39;t just depend on Reddit- you are looking for site and date diversity.
</p>
<p>
Look, all of this can be faked with sufficient effort, but the effort becomes so great that at some point scammers will just move on to easier money.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I hope it all turned out well for you, again sorry I couldn&#39;t respond sooner and reassure you. Very best of luck!

Love this guide, thank you for putting it together!
</p>
<p>
I have my surgery booked for Nov 2024. One of the things I&#39;m most worried about it is the recovery period. Were you provided a schedule of how long you were supposed to avoid certain activities or amounts of time before you could do certain things?  If so adding that to the guide would be really helpful!

Oh, that&#39;s a really good idea. It&#39;s been a little while now and I just looked through my documentation and I can&#39;t find any. I think I mostly got verbal instructions and I don&#39;t seem to have recorded them anywhere.
</p>
<p>
I got very detailed instructions for FFS- I put them all into a spreadsheet to track them! But there was definitely nothing as extensive as that.
</p>
<p>
If I do find something- or someone has more up to date information- I&#39;ll add it to the doc. It&#39;s a really good idea.

I couldn&#39;t find any information, so it would be awesome if you could add it.
</p>
<p>
Very best of luck with the surgery- I hope it goes really well for you! The nurses are lovely, and while I sometimes found their English lacking (or perhaps more specifically, my Thai was non-existent!), they were just genuinely lovely, caring people. It made a huge difference to me. You are in good hands!
