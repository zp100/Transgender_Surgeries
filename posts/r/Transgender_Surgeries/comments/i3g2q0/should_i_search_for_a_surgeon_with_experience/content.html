I commend you for the research and thought that you obviously have put into this. I am not trying to dissuade you but I for one would want to save surgery as a last attempt. As such, have you exhausted all non-surgical alternatives first?  I have a few questions that you may have already considered but might be something to discuss.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do the women in your lineage tend to have small breasts?
</li>
<li>
Do you think that you growth has been stalled?
</li>
<li>
Have you researched Dr Power&#39;s presentation about trans women that have stalled and his remedies?
</li>
<li>
What has your HRT regiment been like?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don&#39;t have enough knowledge about the research to otherwise comment.
</p>
<p>
Regards!

My mom has enormous breasts, my aunt has medium sized ones, my maternal grandmother has large-ish ones and my paternal grandmother has small ones. Yeah I got an episode of itching and a little bit of growth like 8 months ago and nothing since. I&#39;m going to do everything yes, but I&#39;m in the process of gaining some weight first. I think I&#39;m going to be even more radical than him and have pregnancy levels of estradiol and progesterone for a few months. This is still very preliminary in my research, as you can probably tell I&#39;m a killer combination of A. very anxious and B. a know-it-all. So my anxiety at the prospect of not having a surgeon who does the same surgery 5 days a week doing it on me prompted me to research more. I still haven&#39;t researched specific surgeons at all, so I don&#39;t know if that will effectively be the case or not. Anyway, I&#39;m not really getting my hopes up for non-surgical options.

So it sounds like genetically you have potential of reasonable breast growth but stalled out.
</del>
</p>
<p>
So it sounds like genetically that there is some possibility that you may experience breast growth in your life time and that you may have stalled out for one of hundreds of reasons... As always YMMV.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m no expert but here are a few thoughts that I&#39;ve read about that you may or may not have checked out yet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If on injections, adding an oral supplement of estradiol (raise E1) - quotation from Dr Powers:
<em>
I would tell a similar patient that was my patient to take 2mg in the morning and 2mg in the evening orally alongside your shots (swallow it). Do this two weeks on two weeks off (never stop shots). Or, do it constantly. I&#39;m not sure which is better yet.
</em>
See
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrWillPowers/comments/ecbiw9/breast_development_stalled/" rel="nofollow">this post
</a>
</li>
<li>
What is your E2:E1 ratio?
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Backing down on estrogen

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Disclaimer: Please note that the above list is only a few potential causes for lack of breast growth. There are hundreds of other reasons but these were the first few that came to mind.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Changed phrasing and added disclaimer...

Reword this
</p>
<p>
They have reasonable potential of breast growth, not potential of reasonable breast growth.
</p>
<p>
Having ancestors with larger breasts only offers the possibility.  If every ancestor was smaller, then it&#39;s unlikely to exceed that potential.
</p>
<p>
Further, estrogen levels are not the sole reason for breast development.  Growth factors are essential and for many people, that&#39;s not going to be present in high amounts post puberty.  Somebody with a calorie restricted diet, like someone who suffers with ED, is not going to be in an anabolic state.  Estrogen and progesterone can&#39;t fix that.
</p>
<p>
And I don&#39;t mean to criticize you, it&#39;s great that we try and help each other.  But it&#39;s not fair to tell those who don&#39;t develop, hey your great aunt had boobs, so you can too, now go check your levels.

I certainly was not trying to imply
<em>
hey your great aunt had boobs, so you can too,
</em>
as you put it. If my comments was interpreted that way, then I sincerely apologize. My intentions were only to offer help and suggestions on different things to consider in hope to resolve their concern.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll edit my previous comment to clarify my intent.
</p>
<p>
That said, I am honestly bewildered by your criticism that I was implying
<em>
estrogen levels were the sole reason for breast development.
</em>
My partial list of causes, which included 3-4 different possibilities aside from estrogen) was just a suggestion of things to consider. Apparently I should I have added a disclosure that my list of causes are woefully inadequate and that the OP should really on medical professionals whom could list the hundreds of reasons for stalled breast growth.
</p>
<p>
The majority of people here, are here to help, support and lift up others with compassion and I believe that we both have the same goal in mind.
</p>
<p>
I had to chuckle with your statement
<em>
I don&#39;t mean to criticize you.
</em>
If that were true, then you wouldn&#39;t have take the time out to point out my inadequacies in how I phrased things. Your statement only serves to excuse yourself for pointing out someone else&#39;s error.
</p>
<p>
I would like to offer one suggestion (yeah, criticism and I mean it). Your response to me made the accusation that I was saying something that I didn&#39;t. To be constructive and to avoid conflict, it would be better to avoid specifying intention. It would have been better received if you said something like
<em>
based on the way you worded this, I interpreted it as ...
</em>
instead of stating/implying something that I never said.

K, before I read that, you want a good surgeon.  Don&#39;t take a trans specialist one if they&#39;re lame or you don&#39;t like the results

Ok, I rly enjoyed reading that, thank you.  I still feel like finding a trans specialist is not essential, but I would like them to have had worked on a few trans patients and discuss what they think was different.  If it matches what we know, I would definitely trust them and their work.
</p>
<p>
Let me say something nice real quick, every after looks better than the before.  BA is great for trans patients.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;d like to say something blunt, and I am not saying this for any other reason than to set expectations.  You will not have a cis looking chest if your frame is as wide as most of those patients.  You will look better in clothes, possibly reduce dysphoria, but to be completely honest, many of those patients look like men with breast implants.
</p>
<p>
It would be really great for a pioneer orthopedic to emerge and say, fuck it, let&#39;s move some bones around.  Would take years to perfect, but I would rather have my B/C breasts on my slim frame, than to have a larger one and all a doctor can say is, let&#39;s slap 500cc&#39;s on there and see how it goes.

I&#39;m reading your wiki now and it&#39;s great so I hope I can improve it. In the section about round vs anatomical implants you say that you don&#39;t know why people use shaped implants. The reasons for that are outlined
<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00266-019-01595-z" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
, notably when there&#39;s little breast tissue. That study is written by people with connections to the breast implant industry so take it with a grain of salt. As far as I can tell they don&#39;t say any lies per se, they just present it all in a way that makes themselves look good. Shaped implants are good for avoiding the &#34;excessive implant upper pole fullness&#34; that often happens in trans patients according to the fourth study. Plus I just find boobs where the lower half is bigger than the upper half super cute, I do realize that&#39;s probably not a majority opinion.
</p>
<p>
In the
<a href="https://www.sci-hub.tw/10.1097/PRS.0000000000002896" rel="nofollow">study you cited
</a>
saying surgeons couldn&#39;t tell shaped and round implants apart they only evaluated &#34;patients included in this study chose the type of implant. Patients who accepted the implant proposed by the surgeon were excluded from the study&#34;. I think they did this to avoid the issue where the surgeon chooses a shaped implant to correct for some issue, it works correctly, and therefore indistinguishably of a round implant in case the issue didn&#39;t exist in the first place. By having the patient make the choice they believe that they averted this bias but I believe that they have not. Of course the patients know what kind of issues they have. If they already have enough breast tissue to bury the implant and still look natural they aren&#39;t going to bother with shaped implants, but if they have little tissue they might. This is easy for a layperson to figure out, therefore I argue that the patients did figure this out, the ones that would benefit from shaped implants got them and therefore got results as good as the ones who didn&#39;t need them and got round implants.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000003114" rel="nofollow">The only study I found
</a>
which didn&#39;t have that issue. Funny about it is that the plastic surgeons were statistically significantly more likely to be
<em>
wrong
</em>
more often than chance. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on here. If they were wrong slightly more than 50% of the time I wouldn&#39;t think anything but 73.5% is just yikes. I don&#39;t know if implants are supposed to look the same in surgery and after healing. I&#39;m really confused by this.
</p>
<p>
Plus there&#39;s the issue of increased cancer risk I mentioned above. Despite all of that, I&#39;m probably getting shaped breast implants in the future.

I should probably remove my commentary from the wiki. I normally try to avoid it for surgery as it’s impossible to get it right. I’ll link to this post/comment.
</p>
<p>
Personally I’m way more interested in fat transfer these days. There’s some amazing results by a few surgeons.

I had a look at your essay and have some feedback. You assume a lot of technical knowledge on the subject that most people are not going to have. You could make it a lot more accessible if you introduced them or at least linked to other references, such as Wikipedia. There&#39;s probably dozens of these.
</p>
<p>
For example, Cohen&#39;s d. First I&#39;ve heard of it. What is it and why is it interesting? Then there&#39;s a table of traits, but its really hard to understand what they mean, what&#39;s good/bad, and why they are of any interest.
</p>
<p>
And you don&#39;t answer the question raised in the title. Is it necessary to have a specialized surgeon for breast augmentation? There&#39;s no summary which looks at the studies overall and draws a conclusion.
</p>
<p>
Separate subject, but is your site backed up anywhere?

<p>
And? Like go ahead and open
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordell%E2%80%93Weil_theorem" rel="nofollow">some random encyclopedia article on a subject you aren&#39;t a specialist in
</a>
, you&#39;re likely not going to understand the entirety of it. You give two examples of things you didn&#39;t understand and I find it interesting that I addressed both of them in easily readable English. The Cohen&#39;s d:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The clinical implications of this are in order from most to least important: trans patients are going to need wider implants, so you&#39;re going to need either a bigger volume or lower projection; trans patients are going to have a more difficulty getting cleavage, due to the larger distance between the breasts; trans patients have the same N-IMF as cis patients but due to the larger size of the breast the inframammary fold needs to be lowered as to be proportionate.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire point of the statistics with the Cohen&#39;s d was reaching the conclusion in this paragraph. Either you have to learn how to do the math yourself or you have to trust that I&#39;m correct.
</p>
<p>
And also the main point of the table of traits was comparing average implant sizes and which surgeons liked or disliked using textured implants. I went through this in text, it&#39;s easy to understand.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And you don&#39;t answer the question raised in the title
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah you&#39;re right. I chopped off the conclusion because it was too personal about me and I wanted a more encyclopedic tone. I&#39;ll rewrite it later. Btw this is an
<a href="https://17bestradiol.com/wiki/Essay" rel="nofollow">essay

which is exempt from normal editing guidelines. Here&#39;s
<a href="https://17bestradiol.com/wiki/Miroslav_Djordjevic" rel="nofollow">an example
</a>
of a typical article.
</p>
<p>
And yes it&#39;s backed up in my home computer. Yes I know that&#39;s not ideal but if I wanted another server that would nearly double the cost of running the site.
