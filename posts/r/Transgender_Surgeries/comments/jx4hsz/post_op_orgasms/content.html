I&#39;m a trans woman who is a year and a half post op from bottom surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very happy with appearance and things seem to have healed quite well.
</p>
<p>
I can (and do) enjoy sex and masturbation but I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s still some levelling up I can do. My orgasms are different - much more generalised.
</p>
<p>
The first time I orgasmed I felt something like what I used to feel but have never felt that again.
</p>
<p>
Will my orgasms ever feel similar to how they did with the old anatomy? (I&#39;m ok if they don&#39;t; I&#39;m just trying to temper my expectations).

In my experience, it is fully dependent on your state of mind and the workup to the orgasm, I rarely have amazing orgasms but they do occur. But usually I&#39;m in a good space when that happens.

How do the &#34;amazing orgasms&#34; compare to orgasms with your prior anatomy?  I&#39;m just curious how close I am to my own &#34;amazing&#34; orgasm. :)

Well, I&#39;d say they&#39;re different but I don&#39;t actually know if they really are. It&#39;s weird because they&#39;re two completely different actions now.
</p>
<p>
I do feel like it becomes more of a body orgasm when it is good, it&#39;s actually usually the few seconds leading up to the orgasm that&#39;s the best, you feel these waves flow through you, almost like they&#39;re converging on your vagina, when those are intense, it&#39;s amazing. But they almost completely disappear as soon as I orgasm. I&#39;m probably not the right person to ask actually, orgasms were always just a disappointment to me, it always felt like this big buildup to.. nothing. They were extremely underwhelming. So I guess with that in mind, yes, I think they are better, for me anyway

Same here.  First one about 2 months post op was just like before except no muscle contractions obv, because that muscle isn’t there anymore.  I kind of slowly “leaked” out the fluid from the prostate, because while it was produced, it wasn’t expelled by ejaculation (again obviously.) Since then I find that masturbation feels overall much better than before and that can last for a LONG time, but I didn’t have any thundering orgasms like that first one since then. I am only 4 months post-op so I have time, and I figure if the equipment could do it that first time then it can do it again.

Right!  The impulse was there, but no muscle.  I just want to feel that impulse again!

This might be a weird question, but can I ask if you had a lot of bottom dysphoria pre op?  I&#39;m pre everything and I don&#39;t feel like I have a crazy amount of bottom dysphoria (certainly not as much as some others), but it still just doesn&#39;t feel quite right, yeknow?  I very frequently yearn for different parts (esp in sexual situations), but not to the extent that it&#39;s like painful, if that makes sense.
</p>
<p>
Idk, just interested in your experience based on how you phrased your response.  I hope I&#39;m not crossing any lines in asking.

Mine are amazing. They don&#39;t have the &#34;peak&#34; as before. But mine are thrash around, cramp every muscle in my legs, amazing. And they stack. But I know what you mean. There&#39;s no &#34;finality&#34; like before. Though being able to just keep on multipling is damn good instead.
