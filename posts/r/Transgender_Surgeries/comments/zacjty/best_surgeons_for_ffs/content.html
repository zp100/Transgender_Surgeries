Here’s the unfortunate truth, all surgeons are going to have a number of terrible reviews. They are only human and it’s just the way life is. Having said that, it’s all about the statistical successes and years of experience and skill set of the that decreases your chance of having complications or bad results. There are very angry people out there who are going to voice their mad experiences and they have every right to, but you have to look at the context yourself of how often the surgeon is successful on a multitude of credible platforms to make a sure decision.
</p>
<p>
With all that said and done, all the surgeons you listed are the top tier for a reason; they all generally produce quality results. It’s up to you to figure out what you like about each surgeon and what you don’t before making your final decision.
</p>
<p>
Dechamps-Braly is a really good choice for aggressive work on what you are looking for. Jumaily and Harrison Lee are also great choices for what you want and look for!

Wanting aggressive surgeons and being scared about complications is a tough thing to manage. The more aggressive you are, the greater the chance of a longer recovery and complications arising. I’m scared af too and decided to be conservative, but I also know there’s still a chance something can go wrong even with doing all this work up front researching and picking someone non-aggressive + reputable. Its funny, after some research, and my consult this last April - picked a date and everything, just yesterday I  found some complications I hadn’t seen before that a small number of people had and now I’m worried again… have to make sure the benefit outweighs the risk, which is a yes for me but with that, there’s unavoidable risk no one can prevent; can you live with that? Another thing to consider btw is after care and whether they’ll be there for you after surgery. Some surgeons ghost their patients after a few stressed interactions, so they could be good and have had few issues but some of those few issues may tell the story of someone who can’t take heat when things aren’t going as planned. Those people are a no for me, I don’t care how good they are, they must be caring human beings too.

Thank you so much for the information, do you know of any specific top tier doctors that have on multiple occasions ghosted their patients? And just curious what we’re the complications you ran into?

FFS surgeons? No, I haven&#39;t heard anything like it on their end thank goddess. It&#39;s mostly vaginoplasty and top surgery complications I&#39;ve seen or heard personally bad stories about. Cardenas in Florida stopped replying to my good friend there, she needs a revision and he won&#39;t deal with it. Recently Gallagher, also in Florida, has caused a stir with a bad follow-up on a top surgery she seems to have neglected so badly, it could have killed her patient! I didn&#39;t look into the doctors you mentioned too deeply, they are all rock stars though, and have done some impressive stuff... little too freestyle for me but when it comes to chins, we often need aggressive to get a very feminine look, which you may prefer. I don&#39;t want to do two separate surgeries and for the forehead I want, I&#39;m picking Facialteam, their chins are conservative but I can live with that, especially if it means faster recovery, and they are very precise, which I also a factor. The recent concerns I found were extended/longterm lower lip numbness and also coronal incision hair loss months into recovery. I knew about both but didn&#39;t find the more worrisome stories until recently and that revisions were needed for the latter, for instance. Ugh.

Sorry, it&#39;s been a long day, I meant Salgado, not Cardenas.

Could you elaborate a bit on Salgado or get your friend to post a review. There’s not been much posted on him after the scandal and his moving to Florida.

She’s not on here. I’ll try to explain as best I can… Her vaginal canal takes a turn and also she feels like he buried some part of her former penis that gets hard in a way, and it’s painful, plus she can’t have orgasms or vaginal sex (due to the angle). Dilation was super tough and she lost tons of depth and overall the look is off, I haven’t seen it recently but it wasn’t like most I see here when I saw it a month in last year. She needed a revision for a problem of urine puddling inside her, sort of like her vaginal canal was like a pee trap (plumbing), and urine would spill out after peeing and wiping, he did fix that but then left an angle and not being able to dilate after that caused the depth closure. She’s depressed and wasn’t expecting to not be able to have sex over a year later, never mind the angle and aesthetic issues. This time when she asked for help he started to give her the run around and now won’t return her emails or calls. He promised her a perfect result, told her it looked like the one of the best results he’s ever had after she questioned it’s appearance in the beginning and he has a record of laughing at girls online. Another friend of my friend in Florida used him and she’s devastated too, they looked into suing but no lawyers will touch it. Insurance is why she ended up going to him, insurance is giving her trouble too, it’s a mess. She’s inquiring in Thailand now for a revision, $20-30k is about all she could afford and even that’s a stretch, I’m helping and may get something done too.

Thanks, I added this to the wiki.

I don&#39;t think she would get anywhere legally. He doesn&#39;t have malpractice insurance so lawyers won&#39;t take the case unless you pay them, which virtually no patient can afford.

There law in Florida heavily favors surgeons, which is apparently why some of them move there.
</p>
<p>
Why did she go to him?

Thank you HiddenStill. Lawyers never told her why they wouldn&#39;t touch it, most just ignored her inquiries, interesting, I&#39;ll pass that on. Florida sucks.
</p>
<p>
Insurance made her go to him, she had no choice, unless she wanted to pay out of pocket. The initial procedure was almost $125K if I&#39;m not mistaken, she can&#39;t afford that. Ironically, I had her inquire with Gallagher about a revision before her latest antics but she wouldn&#39;t touch it and insurances didn&#39;t match either (a blessing in retrospect). Based on videos I&#39;ve seen of her, I was sure Gallagher was going to be sympathetic and at least offer suggestions... I even have her book, Affirmed, so thought she might be a valuable resource but I see her true colors now; she had nothing to say, of course, another one of these heartless, money hungry pukes. I am going to ask my friend to review what I wrote and also make sure she&#39;s ok with it, I know this has been traumatizing for her and I don&#39;t want to add to that trauma, or get key facts wrong.

FFS, top surgery, vaginoplasty, doesn&#39;t matter, if any doctor or surgeon wants to care for this community, they need to be consistent, professional AND compassionate, and if they don&#39;t care about us we cannot let them hide their cruelty or lack of concern.

IMHO you owe it to yourself to inquire with Paul Mittermiller.
</p>
<p>
He trained under Keojampa and his work has changed my life.
