Fourth week is
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/px2d8n/grs_4_week_follow_up_surgeon_dr_klemenz_team/">here
</a>
</p>
<p>
Pictures for month 3 are
<a href="https://lensdump.com/a/9nznT">here
</a>
</p>
<p>
so lets go into Month 3
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 5
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;ve measured my dilators and i have 10.5cm of depth.
<br>
Also i can finally start HRT again. Sad think is that my aftercare appointment got cancelled, cause the gyn doesn&#39;t know anything. Also in my city there are 0 gyn doctors who would take me.
<br>
So since i also had problems with douching and dilating i was going to emergency, but also there i got denied, cause they are full and its not emergency enough üòê
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 6
</li>
</ul>
<p>
since my wound separation at my perineum is getting better, dilation becomes more complicated üòÖ Also now i am using a smaller one too and, to my surprise, it works way better.
<br>
I now got a local (40 km away) appointment with a gyn and she also don&#39;t know anything but is interested in learning more. According to her, it looks kinda good though
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 7
</li>
</ul>
<p>
after dilation i measured again and can say i now have round about 11.5 cm of depth.
<br>
Also I&#39;ve tried using only the 2 largest ones, but doesn&#39;t work, so still need 3 dilators each session. Also be careful when you have to sneeze while dilating, my dilator was like a bullet out of my vagina.   üò¨ And my boyfriend also was allowed to touch me down there the first time (not allowed from surgeon but from me) üôà
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 8
</li>
</ul>
<p>
nothing really new or interesting, just had a little bit more of discharge again and have written to my surgeon cause of some stuff.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 9
</li>
</ul>
<p>
got a call from my surgeon
</p>
<p>
it looks all quite good
<br>
reduce the time for dilation (15 min instead of 30 per dilator)
<br>
don&#39;t use lavanid (wound healing gel) as often, instead use E3 creme
<br>
cooling only in emergencies
<br>
the yellow stuff on clitoris is also ok and still pretty normal
<br>
douching only with clear water, nothing else
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 10
</li>
</ul>
<p>
first time i also was bleeding and not only had discharge from my vagina, me kinda panicked and don&#39;t wanna imagine how afab ppl are reacting getting their period the first time. üò¨
</p>
<p>
Gyn is saying still all pretty good and she removed the yellow stuff on my vagina. And the good part is, dilating is easier since the removing, it hurts way less :3
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 11
</li>
</ul>
<p>
also here nothing really new, except that i had my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/qq0dky/nsfw_had_my_first_time_piv_yesterday/">first time
</a>
piv sex with my boyfriend :3   üôà I am not recommending this to anyone, it wasn&#39;t clever, despite being incredible.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 12
</li>
</ul>
<p>
now i can go down to 2 dilators per session, now it works :3
<br>
Also going to plan for the 2nd surgery down there now.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
week 13
</li>
</ul>
<p>
is like 2 days, the only thing happend is that i measured again after dilation and have now round about 13 cm of depth.
</p>
<p>
So this was all, Gonna make another follow up in 3 month or so :3

The 2nd stage.
</p>
<p>
In Germany it&#39;s quite common to make GRS a 2 stage surgery.
</p>
<p>
Right now i want the canal slightly different, and my labia majora slightly different (if that&#39;s possible) otherwise they would also then start to do the mons pubis
</p>
<p>
From their
<a href="https://www.lubos-kliniken.de/fachbereiche/transgenderzentrum/mann-zu-frau/einzelschritte-der-op/">website
</a>
(it&#39;s full German) stage 2 they will
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Widen the vaginal entrance
</li>
<li>
Doing the mons pubis
</li>
<li>
Making the clitoral hood
</li>
<li>
Maybe correction of labia minora and majora
</li>
<li>
Maybe, widening of urethra, remove more erectile tissue
</li>
</ul>

Vielen dank f√ºr das Teilen deiner Erfahrungen und auch Bilder. Dein Ergebnis sieht echt Klasse aus, bin selbst noch auf der Suche nach einem Arzt f√ºr die Zukunft, bin ja noch ganz am Anfang also wird es noch eine Weile dauern, also wer wei√ü was die Zukunft noch f√ºr Ergebnisse anderer √Ñrzte hervor bringt. Aber bisher sieht dein Ergebnis sehr √ºberzeugend aus. Erst mal die Klinik zwischen gespeichert :D

Hey, first of all thanks a bunch for sharing all of this with us. Especially in such detail and every step. It really helps me with deciding if I want to go for STS as well as I‚Äôve never really been convinced by the results ‚Ä¶ but yours do really look amazing. The team did a great job with it and I‚Äôm now very certain I want SRS too.
</p>
<p>
Is it okay if I have a question that‚Äôs a little personal?

Good point üòÖ
</p>
<p>
On the picture it seems like some hair is growing. How much is it/how annoying is it to get rid of?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd imagine with how things are repurposed there‚Äôd be some hair growing in places it shouldn‚Äôt be, like ‚Ä¶ ugh trying to not sound disrespectful just makes it sound weird so ‚Ä¶ do you have stray hairs from what used to be a scrotum growing near the entrance or even inside your vagina? (Sorry I‚Äôm not too sure what gets put where during the procedure)
</p>
<p>
I ask this because my own privates (and only those for some reason) are quite hairy and I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôd interfere with the procedure somehow ‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
And my second question would be how prominent of a clitoris do you have now/will be having after stage two?

Sry to answer you so late, had some trouble in real life üôà
</p>
<p>
Yes hair is growing on labia majora and a few on labia minora. Most likely how it grows on cis vulvas.
</p>
<p>
Also i have a bit harier ass so it grows a little bit more on the perineum there too, but nothing really uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
Inside the vagina I have 0 hair to my knowledge. Also i haven&#39;t done electrolyse down there, cause it&#39;s not recommended in Germany and done with the surgery.
</p>
<p>
My clitoris is prominent enough I would say, in the gallery I have some spread ones and I like the little one I have, she is definitely sensible enough and will not be made bigger. (Also my clitoris has like a head and 2 small arms)

I&#39;m on 7 months HRT but haven&#39;t really gotten the results I&#39;d want so I guess I&#39;ll have to get some surgeries at some point ... and looking at your pictures ... gives me hope? Euphoria?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be reading the whole thing next year. Thanks again. You&#39;re really kind &lt;3

Hello! Thank you for sharing this very helpful information about the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I have a question was it painful in any way after the surgery? If so when and on what conditions. What do you recommend people do and not do for while before the surgery?

It was painful (it was hell) as written in my first and second week update. (Only have gotten stronger painkillers on day 3)
</p>
<p>
What I recommend doing? ü§î That&#39;s a hard question cause it depends way to munch on the individual, the surgeon and the techniques.
</p>
<p>
I.e. I was in hospital for 4 weeks here in Germany were other ppl are released in like a week in other countries, this already is a huge difference.
</p>
<p>
I recommend having someone with you if something is going not as expected and stuff you can do while laying in bed, at least for me that was the majority of time.
</p>
<p>
After surgery don&#39;t be to fast to get back, take your time, your body needs it. (I am privileged enough to say that and my GP wrote me a 18 week sick leave)
</p>
<p>
Prior to surgery mostly the use it or lose if it&#39;s in any kind a PI. Dunno if it will help but better safe then sorry üòÖ

I really appreciate you taking your time to write the answer. What are no-nos and yes-yeses of looking after the vagina after it has completely healed and formed, did the doctors let you know of anything?

Since I am still far away from completely healed (takes round about a year) I can&#39;t really say something about this, but they haven&#39;t said that I shouldn&#39;t do some stuff.
