I need FFS and I&#39;m trying to muster the courage to get started (this is a bit terrifying!). I&#39;m in the Mt. Sinai system already for HRT and want to use insurance, so I figured working within this system can help me narrow down doctor choices. I care most about chin/jaw area work, and considering brow/orbital area too.

Between Ting, Pang, and Avanessian can anyone recommend from experience? Or how would you narrow it down further?

Ting did my srs (BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE!!) but he doesnâ€™t do FFS anymore
</p>
<p>
Bella (FFS) is very good!
</p>
<p>
Pang never heard of him for FFS only breast augmentation

Iâ€™m not familiar with the Mt. Sinai surgeons, but just wanted to offer you some encouraging words and support! I had FFS earlier this year in March and it can be so simple (the changes made), but make a world of difference! That was my first major surgery and physically I have recovered really well. Mentally itâ€™s taken some getting use to ppl always gendering me correctly now rather than most of the time like before. I say all this just to let you know that you will make it out on the other side! ðŸ¤—
