Is it normal not to see your clit 6 weeks post op? Also, why so much white stuff? Most of my pain is from my clitoris area so it worries me.

Wow don&#39;t worry, the white stuff really look as fibrin and you seem have a lot of swelling. It took me a while to see mine and in my case near to a year for sensation to came back, than relax and let the think heal, it&#39;s only 6 weeks. By the way clit necrosis is fairly rare and more rare on experimented surgeon. I&#39;m a brassard girl and I never heard about clit necrosis on him and he performed many thousands.

Who is your surgeon? My clit, as well as every patient who went to my Doctor, can see their clit very easy.

Mines pretty well hidden from Wittenberg too. Thats all pretty normal. My clit hurt for a while because theres a TON of stitches in there. Plus pain is good because the nerves are reconnecting

Oh. Don‚Äôt stretch too much, because you‚Äôre 6 weeks out. Maybe around 1.5 months you can spread things further.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if you had dehiscence or necrosis of the clit? Usually doctors bundle all the nerves then refashion that part of the ‚Äúhead of the penis‚Äù, to become the clit.
</p>
<p>
Historically, she made clits large (to increase chance of retaining sensitivity). A lot of docs do this actually. It‚Äôs very difficult though to see yours.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any sensation in that upoer part of your hood?

I&#39;ve got the same issue. im a month and a half post op and i still can&#39;t see my clit (she&#39;s hiding) I&#39;ve been told by my doctor that its probably due to the hypergranulation around in that area. I&#39;ve got an appointment with a specialist about this next week to see if it needs to be treated or not. other then that my doctor says everything else is healing very well.

A friend was in a similar state a few years ago. After a while, that white mass fell away like a scab, and everything under it was perfectly fine.

It‚Äôs looking great. You have a great surgeon‚Äîfollow the office‚Äôs post-op instructions and run concerns by them. The button of the clit is likely hidden by the swelling and recessed under the hood.

Looks like a lot of swelling still.  With that much swelling, odds are the pain is related to the pressure you are feeling and possibly nerve regeneration.

My clitoral hood is swollen and completely hides my clit at 6 weeks. I just posted a pic and got good replies about the white stuff too, check my profile

So it seems like you&#39;re still very swollen and that can affect it. Also I believe the white stuff is just stitches that are/have dissolved
