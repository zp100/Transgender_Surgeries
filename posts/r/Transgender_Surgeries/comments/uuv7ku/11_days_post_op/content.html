Hi ladies.  I had srs with Dr. Ramineni on May 10th.  Not a lot of pain.  My incisions are healing.  This afternoon I was able to do purple dilator for 5 minutes, blue dilator for 10 minutes, then the green dilator for 10 minutes.  I was able to insert each so the top first notch was just barely visible.   There was  a lot of pressure with green, but not pain.  I will do this three times daily.  Things are going well.
