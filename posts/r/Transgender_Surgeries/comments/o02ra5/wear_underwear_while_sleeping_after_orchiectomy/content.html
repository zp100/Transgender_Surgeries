I had my bilateral surgery this morning. I messaged my doctor with this question too, but if I don&#39;t hear from her before I sleep, does anyone remember which way they slept? I was thinking being naked would be good because it would air out and not get sweaty?
</p>

The surgery was a snap! I feel fantastic at the moment. I&#39;m sure I will be sore tomorrow, but right now I wouldn&#39;t even know I had a surgery. They have me on tramadol pills for a couple days.

I&#39;m in more pain than yesterday. My throat is sore from the breathing tube and it feels like someone punched me right above my groin.

Id sleep with cotton undies or sthebsurgical ones they might have sent you home in. Try and keep a clean layer of something between the incision and whatever else you come in contact with. If I recall - I just had gauze pads and my normal panties and had no issues.  My incision was glued as well to prevent anything from getting into it.

I changed underwear before bed and kept fresh gauze over the area. I think itâ€™s best to have it covered with some pressure on it rather than risk having it catch/rub on something. Good luck with your recovery :)

Mine was this last Friday  Went great just like you said. It was percocets and antibiotics.  The percs constipated me severely to the point i traded them for weed. I don&#39;t like opiates. Now day 6 after yesterday was hell cramps that agitate the very tender front upper growin area. And the constipation finally breaking free was a nightmare. Im gonna try to fast some today so my guts can catch a break.  Everything gave me severe stomach aches too. Whole system is kinda not good right now. But its shot day so that may help my mood. Cried allot yesterday. Hormones mixed with pain boohooo
