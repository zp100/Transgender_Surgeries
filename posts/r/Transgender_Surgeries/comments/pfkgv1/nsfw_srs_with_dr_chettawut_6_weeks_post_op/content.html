<p>
Figured I‚Äôd share an update for people who may be following or potentially interested in Dr. Chettawut.
</p>
<p>
To start, everything was seemingly fine post packing removal.  Dilation was incredibly painful and felt odd the first time but as with anything, with repetition it gets much easier.  It wasn‚Äôt even too painful- I managed to stop taking painkillers altogether a few days after the catheter was removed.  The time I did take them, I was always taking less than the given amount anyway.
</p>
<p>
I did end up having a slight complication- at my follow up, Dr. Chettawut found that I had a growth of granulation tissue toward the entrance.  However this growth was like a round globular structure about the size of a small grape.  I had become so accustomed to pushing past it (by that time, I was using dilator #1 and had even halfheartedly attempted dilator #2 and managed to get a decent amount inside.  This growth had to cauterized and dug out so I underwent a revision with local anesthesia.  That was honestly the most pain I‚Äôve experienced throughout this whole process.  I felt everything and also smelled the cauterizing- things etched into my brain that I‚Äôll never forget.  Having a catheter for three days wasn‚Äôt fun but in the long run, my urinating seemed to be better for it (I had experienced some frequent urination as well- couldn‚Äôt tell if it was a UTI or getting accustomed to my new configuration) and dilating was easier now that I didn‚Äôt have to push past this growth.  I slowly eased back into dilation with few problems.
</p>
<p>
The returning flights were fine- I didn‚Äôt dilate of course and waited until I got home.  I was noticeably tight after going at least 24 hours without dilating but with the repetition and routine, I got back to full depth more easily and seem to get a bit deeper than when I was in Thailand.  Go figure.  Dilation is still a chore and sometimes I skip sessions due to irregular sleep schedule or being busy with tasks of life.  I‚Äôm a runner so I apply the same attitude for missed runs- don‚Äôt beat yourself up and just do better the next time.  From what I‚Äôve read and experienced, the anxiety doesn‚Äôt help your muscles relax anyway.  Thankfully, I can get to depth within 5-10 mins, sometimes a little shorter or longer depending on the length of time elapsed between sessions.  Due to the revision, I had to scale back to #0 and only started using #1 again on the 21st.  I‚Äôm excited to start with #2 on Saturday- I can‚Äôt wait to eventually get to the orange Soul Source #4.  It seems daunting now but I‚Äôm praying I‚Äôll get there.
</p>
<p>
Energy wise, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good.  From the day of the packing removal, my mom encouraged me to walk around.  I follow that and walked around my hotel‚Äôs hallway up and down every day.  I started with 15 mins and then increased as my energy came back.  Today, I‚Äôm able to walk a good couple of miles and I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll have a smooth return to running which I sorely miss.  Since I‚Äôve been home, I‚Äôve cooked large meals and baked cakes so I‚Äôm getting there.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics - it seems to look very nice, I think.  There‚Äôs some hair toward the entrance/perineum (I had no hair removal) but nothing major.  I think there‚Äôs still swelling (also- would my taking virtually zero painkillers or ibuprofen affect the swelling?  If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôll just have to wait for everything to naturally settle down as I continue healing).  What say you?
</p>
<p>
Sex- before my surgery I typically masturbated prone.  Since about last week, I‚Äôve watched porn and felt turned on.  My clitoris was a bit sensitive but I do feel some sort of ‚Äòrelease‚Äô when I orgasm.  I‚Äôm not sure how that will evolve as I heal but overall I do have good sensation all over- the canal I can feel every inch of the dilator and my labia and clit.  I‚Äôll need to look for a good vibrator and continue the process of relearning my body as I settle.
</p>
<p>
Overall, this has been a wonderful process and with time, I hope everything continues smoothly.  Dr. Chettawut and his team were very kind and warm and I‚Äôd recommend them.  If anyone ever has any questions, feel free to ask.

Thank you!! I have a little bit of discharge yes.  I think that is the lymphatic fluid being ejected from my body as time moves on.

If I‚Äôm not mistaken, depth is usually limited by one‚Äôs anatomy - there‚Äôs a band of muscles that protect the digestive organs.

In the fourth picture you posted the view looks weird from your perspective looking down on it. I wonder if it&#39;s the angle of the shot or what?

Are you referring to the picture of the result from the Hello Kitty mirror?  I was pointing the camera down to get the mirror.  What looks weird?  Does it seem weird in the other pictures?

Yes that picture, I was thinking how it looks like it&#39;s lopsided from your perspective if that makes any sense. I dunno if it&#39;s the angle. And the other pictures seemed fine.
</p>
<p>
I dunno but details like that are a make or break for me when I eventually get to having the operation. Which is god knows when üòÖ

Hi there! Thank you! No- this is non penile inversion with scrotal skin graft done by Dr. Chettawut! I need to update, just have to get waxed first.
