Body dysmorphia is what it seems like you&#39;re going through. Your results are amazing. I would seek counselling, it helped with my body dysmorphia. There is no way your FFS was a mistake if your goal was to be beautiful and to pass as fem. Absolutely stunning.

Yeah, I’m studying all of this and she looks really good now. She looked good before but does look better now
</p>
<p>
Obviously if she’s in pain or something that’s a different issue, but just in terms of looks you look great OP
</p>
<p>
I’m really not seeing this lopsided bone thing at least from these pictures. You look symmetrical and totally normal/pretty.

Girl legit you looked like you had a cute girl next door thing going on before FFS, however you look much more naturally feminine after the surgery, you have rounder features and it does look good.
</p>
<p>
i see the scare for the hair advancement still so it seems like the surgery has not been that long ago. Remember even though you may feel good and it feels like its been a long time, it takes a year before the swelling goes away.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Additionally you always saw another person in the mirror prior to the surgery and its super easy to disassociate yourself from what you looked like and now you will hyper focus on it for a whille.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
you do look good, and if i passed you on the street you would be another feminine presenting person in the sea of people around me.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
please take care of yourself and you will feel better soon.

Yes this one. You look good either way. One you look more model-esque female beforehand, and now you look like a normal female. I like both. (From a cis female)

Hey, you’re going through a difficult/critical time, do not trust your thoughts and the way you perceive yourself until the crisis passes. There’s honestly nothing particularly wrong or botched in your pictures, it’s just the healing process. Brake the downwards dysphoria spiral and stop looking at yourself for some time, avoid obsessing over mirrors and pictures and before you know it the crisis will be over and you will be able to see yourself more objectively again.

This is really good advice.
</p>
<p>
OP: I honestly love how you surgery came out. You have a very sweet and feminine face. I see a bit of the asymmetry, but only because you noted it and I was looking for it. Had you not, it more than likely would&#39;ve gone unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
We are all our own worst critics. It took me nearly a year for my first surgery for me to start to see the woman emerge. I saw different defects that overtime I no longer see.
</p>
<p>
My recommendation is to talk to your therapist, or to get one, so that you can speak about this and work it out. Even if you decide that it&#39;s still wrong, there is always the potential of a revision.
</p>
<p>
I wish you the best and that someday you&#39;re able to look in the mirror and see the beautiful woman that you are.

It&#39;s dysmorphia love. You look cis and I&#39;m not just saying that.
</p>
<p>
If it makes you feel any better, I had surgery in 2019 with mixed results. I&#39;ve had 1 revision for additional fat grafts/fat removal and I plan to have a 2nd revision for my chin/jaw this time next year. Your life isn&#39;t over. If you have anything you want to change in the coming months just start saving for it and when you reach that goal reevaluate if you still feel the same way. It will get better &lt;3

You do look passable after the surgery, it&#39;s all in your head, I think that you just need to accept everything about yourself and focus more on therapy,,

How long has it been? If you’re still swollen it takes a year for most of it to go away. The after looks softer.

That&#39;s definitively dysmorphia, you look completely fine. I honestly dont see the asymetry you&#39;re talking about. My lips are super asymetrical, and while it stands out in pictures, most people dont notice it irl because people dont really pay attention to that. I think you&#39;re pretty cute and you totally pass

looking at your post surgery pictures.. i didn’t even finish reading what you had wrote before i was thinking “she looks like she would be a very sweet teacher”.
</p>
<p>
i know your results definitely might not be what you hoped for, i think you look wonderful. you look softer and more approachable, and i 100% could see you teaching a class of elementary students.

Some shock hair loss is normal after hairline advancement. But honestly, if your hair has thinned, I can’t even tell from the pictures. I think you look great.

What the fuck are you talking about
</p>
<p>
I hate to be aggressive about it, but there&#39;s noticeable results from before and after. And on top of that, surgery sweeping doesn&#39;t show &#34;real&#34; results until up to a year or so after the surgery itself. You look great and more feminine than before, chill

Hmmm reading you, I understand your point. But overall, I have the feeling, the issue is not the results of the ffs, but stands somewhere else, such as accepting who you are without having the weight of the look of others on your shoulders. It is just an assumption, but it is like you’re using features linked to the ffs feeling completely blocked and helpless, to avoid facing the real trouble, the one that really hurts. That is quite normal to focus heavily on something else than the real subject that hurts badly, so don’t blame you for that. For that point, I would suggest you to put it on the table with your Therapist. And it will probably take time to dig into it and solve. In all cases, there is no mistake, or nothing wrong in what you’ve done.
</p>
<p>
With regards to your hair, let me suggest to go to the hair dresser, and give them care and cut. You deserve it.

Do not trust your thoughts.
</p>
<p>
Keep at it and don’t let this rough patch best you. You look wonderful. Dealing with dysphoria AND dysmorphia is rough but you have to ride it out like waves during rough tides. It will pass. Focus your energy on other things.
</p>
<p>
That is how I deal with mine.

I will say this. I would love to get where you are someday. You are doing it! Don&#39;t look at the things you dislike. Look at the entire portrait and you will see you&#39;re beautiful!!!🥰🥰🥰  Whatever defects you perceive are completely pacified by your absolutely stunning attributes. And those are what people are drawn to. Live your best life sweetheart! And love yourself! ❤️🧡💛💚💙🤎💜

What part of your life is ruined exactly? You were passing before, even more so after the surgery! I would kill for your hair! In my books you are a definition of success, unless you post side by side before and after pictures, with no makeup, front, 45 degrees, and side and clearly articulate what is bothering you. You look f.ing phenomenal!

I know it&#39;s hard but you are not seeing yourself correctly and likely experiencing body dysmorphia. You look gorgeous and very passable.  Please give it time, it takes a long time to heal.  I am still changing and I had my FFS in April.  I had the same feelings you are and it gets better. 🤗 ❤️

Your face shape is the exact same as my Cis girlfriends. You&#39;re all good :)
</p>
<p>
Remember, your whole face has changed- your brain needs time to get used to it. Even years later it may still catch you as a suprise. After my top surgery, which saved me life, and was very much wanted- still left me feeling uncomfortable for a time.

You are still in the recovery phase for your surgery. They can take months or even a year before you start noticing and even feeling sensation back. After surgery you can expect a depression phase. It is tough. Your body is going through changes. Give it time. You made no mistake I’m sure. You will be fine. When you get in a bad place reach to someone or breath it out. You will recover and feel positive!

I’ve been through the same thing feeling like this. But trust me it’s in your head and it’s not what others see. My result is incredible, and yet there’s times it feels off and I can’t figure out why. You need to let your body relearn some things.
</p>
<p>
What I’ve realized is after surgery you need to teach yourself to smile properly again. muscles you used before surgery were balanced to that structure. Now it’s different and some things might be a bit different. Trust me. You look better post op. Practice making faces, find your new angles. What worked before might not work now.

Yeah you look great after the surgery. It&#39;s really hard to understand psychologically when your face changes after a big surgery. It&#39;ll settle out and you&#39;ll see what we are after a while

Love, I know it&#39;s been said before, but you really do look amazing.  Please know that these feelings will pass along as you work on understanding where they come from and how to deal with them. The reality is that you look wonderful and haven&#39;t ruined your life.  Those feelings are just your mind trying to keep you down.

I have more jaw asymmetry than you do, from what I can tell. I never noticed my jaw being asymmetrical before surgery, but it was there. The entire left side of my body is significantly larger than the right side. I didn&#39;t notice any of it until after facial surgery, aside from breast asymmetry. I relate to the feels you&#39;re going through, cause I stressed hard about it and had my surgeon give me a revision on the larger side of my jawline. He didn&#39;t fix it, but I&#39;m kinda OK with it now.
</p>
<p>
Hair line seems OK to me.. much lower and it might be masculine, but I think it&#39;s within feminine proportions.
</p>
<p>
I know it seems hopeless when you&#39;ve done all the things and still aren&#39;t happy with your progress.. part of it is that your mindset has to adjust to the new features. I recently had some luck dating, and took a walk around one of my favorite trails from childhood, and suddenly I was able to see myself in selfies. Something just clicked that sometime in the last few years of isolation, I became pretty. Dysphoria still sucks and there&#39;s still more I can do, but I&#39;m more confident in my looks overall.
</p>
<p>
I think you might be in a similar place, but it hasn&#39;t clicked yet. I think you look great! Hope it helps &lt;3

Sweetie, I think you’re absolutely gorgeous! Trust me, I think everyone is right, in time you will come to love yourself again. Surgery of any kind is a big change let alone changing your image. Expectations versus reality. But reality in this case is so beautiful! Let the healing continue, stay strong, I couldn’t not comment on how amazing you are. We are all here for you!

You legit look fine. In fact you look great even. I read the title and clicked expecting something horrible, stared at the pictures for a minute and couldn’t find anything wrong. Then I read the post body and I still don’t see anything wrong.
</p>
<p>
It’s dysmorphia, you look so much more feminine in your post-op photos and there’s nothing wrong with your hairline.

Honey, your mind is being cruel to you. Honestly, post-op you look great and more feminine than before. When I had some ffs I felt the same but it got better in time. Your mind is being cruel, give it some time. You look so pretty.

I&#39;m being 100% honest when I read the title I thought this would be a detrans post, your results are amazing. The jaw and chin job is a work or art. It looks natural too, you don&#39;t look like you&#39;ve had work done.

This is very common after FFS your brain hasn’t adjusted fully. Give yourself more time and be gentle with yourself. Try to avoid over analyzing how you look.

Girl WHAT? Brain fuckin worms. Your pictures give me HOPE because my face is similar to how yours was pre-surgery - tall and quite masculine.

Reality check... you looked visibly trans before FFS. Especially that bottom left picture. Now you don&#39;t at

- you look SOOOO much better it&#39;s insane.

as others have said, you look fine. your hairline doesn&#39;t look abnormal in any way to me. Definitely not &#34;too low&#34;. I see no asymmetry. I&#39;m sure their is some because all humans have some, and it&#39;d be weird if there wasn&#39;t but it&#39;s not noticeable.
</p>
<p>
To be honest this sounds a lot like how many people with eating disorders simply can&#39;t believe that they&#39;re not fat, even when they&#39;re nearing malnutrition levels of skin and bones.
</p>
<p>
in your case, it sounds like you&#39;re having trouble believing that you&#39;re the pretty woman you are, and you should do whatever it takes to find a professional who has experience with body image issues.

I dig both before and after shots tbh, but you definitely look more fem after surg. Hang in there girl, this is a huge step and it&#39;s not at all weird for you to feel uncomfortable about a changed appearance at first, but honestly please dont feel like youve ruined your life. Lets say you still feel bad after a couple months or longer. There are ways to change what you&#39;re unhappy with if you&#39;re still unhappy. Give yourself some slack and remember it&#39;s ok to feel all kinds of emotions rn. Babe, you look like a real cutie! &lt;3

There is no mistake. You are looking great. What needs work is your self-image. You really need to be happy about your self - because that is the most important. Please follow the advice from others here and seek some professional help with bodydysmorphia.

I’m sorry and I empathize with that feeling. I also felt pretty awful after my first ffs. But trust me, after a year it went away mostly. The comment section is not lying, you look good now too. I would suggest to give yourself some time. My hair fell out too but came back slowly, I even changed my haircut to match the new hairline and new face

Not everyone would be lying to you in this post, first things first! 💗🙏🏼💙 secondly, i can resonate with this and worried what you’re feeling will happen to me too. You’re not alone in your dysphoria, or alone in your thoughts okay. Lastly, I think you look a bit more femme after, and are definitely NOT deformed, experiencing a bad mishap case, or anything near that. Dysphoria sucks, and I hope with therapy and time you will be able to see the beautiful, if only slight, difference, and love/trust yourself even more for following your own path. Our inner dialogue is powerful, and so important to nourish 💗🏳️‍⚧️

This is definitely body dysmorphia your feeling definitely keep working with a therapist and start looking at women that share your current faceshape irl.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a trans man but 5&#39;3 I have dysmorphia regarding my height not dysphoria. People watching as seeing men that are my height has been extremely helpful. I also try not to look at like celebrities or compare myself to highly edited pictures of male models or whatever. I&#39;d recommend cutting out time on things like Instagram, models, ect you look cis af and so much more fem after surgery. You look cute and very nice girl next door vibes! Your very pretty!

I think a dose of tough love is needed here: You pass, and you pass beautifully. You didn’t ruin your life, you are now a beautiful you. You’re not a “plasticized” version of a Barbie doll, but a lovely female version of you. Yes, dysphoria is kicking you in the ass, but take it from me, don’t let that monster take you down. You are a much stronger person than that, and believe everyone here, that you look lovely, and pass completely. You need some encouragement, please feel free to reach out and DM me.

I had the same thoughts after my ffs, I had really dark thoughts about life, I hated what was done to me, but after a while you get used to your new face and you get over it. Give yourself some time for your brain to readjust to your new face

Not even addressing the hair thing because I really can’t speak about it (and also your hair is gorgeous) but I do know mentally it can be hard to adjust to a change in your face and at one point you saw a different face, whereas now you have a face you have to get used to. Once you’ve had some time, and have been able to live with this face for longer I am sure you will come to see what we all see, which is a very cute passing, young woman.

Hey sis, I’m sorry you’re feeling this way about yourself. You’re entitled to feel however you want, however, as many others have already said, I think you look great! I also think many of us have this ideal of what we think women should look like, but even for cis women there is SO much variation in their appearance. There are many different ways to be attractive and without an ounce of disingenuousness, I can say that I think you look super-cute!  As far as your hairline, I’m married to a cis woman who is considered attractive by most and she has a much lower hairline than you. The lower hairline is a sign of youth and I think many women wish theirs was lower. I mean, cis women also get hairline lowering procedures for that very reason.  Anyhow, I hope you can be more kind and gentle with yourself when you look at photos of you and see yourself as others do… feminine and pretty.

You are a stranger and I have no reason to lie to you or make you feel better for no reason. I didn’t know what sub this was in at first flipping through pics and just thought you were a cis girl who got surgery done. You look cis before and look even more cis after. You’re very feminine and pretty.

Hey there, I was there, too, after I had FFS. A couple of things to remember:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It looks like you&#39;re only three months out. It takes a LONG time for things to settle down. Give it another three to six months before you assess the results.
</li>
<li>
Your brain is playing a trick on you because your face is now different than it was used to.
</li>
<li>
The hairline scar is definitely the worst. I did have hair transplants to cover it and will realistically go back for one more round.
</li>
<li>
We hyper-focus on our flaws, and cell phone cameras only accentuate those flaws! I asked my dermatologist about scar treatments for my lip lift scar and she was like &#34;wtf are you talking about?! You don&#39;t have a scar.&#34;
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Best of luck!
</p>
<p>
PS - you look great.

What you talk about is how you see yourself in photos. Facial Feminization does nothing for that. Yeah it can give you a better selfie. But also you have to learn how to express your new feminine features. Be more positive towards yourself and know it isn&#39;t magic getting surgery. Girls pose way different than guys in pics and learning the best angles is key! Literally the angle you tilt your head is important. You&#39;ll get better. I remember I sucked at taking pics and smiling as a guy and eventually I learned. Then I transitioned and all I would see are big arms shoulders face etc and then I learned how to pose to really look good. I think your FFS is a great start but keep up with the work. Don&#39;t feel hopeless cause there&#39;s a lot more you can still do to make things better.
</p>
<p>
Like in none of your selfies do I see a feminine facial pose. Like duck face, pouting your lips, etc. Everyone else taking selfies are in these ultra feminine poses and if you aren&#39;t how do you expect to look like them? Angle your chin down, open your eyes wide, and think sexy female. That is a good place to start!

Your face doesn&#39;t look asymmetrical to me and your hairline looks fine as well. I think you are having a BDD/depression episode and I say that as someone with clinical depression and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
You look like a cute woman, I think you need to realize that other people don&#39;t see the face you had before or see it the same way you do.
</p>
<p>
a trans friend who had FFS explained it like this: FFS is just something we get to pass a little better, not something we get to be beautiful. beauty is subjective. You just need to accept your face at this point and move on, your life is not over.

I&#39;m sure you have read everyone&#39;s comments about dysmorphia. I 100% agree with them, but it&#39;s really important for you to nail down if, and why you might be experiencing this.
</p>
<p>
Could be lots of different things, of course.  Increased anxiety or depression can present as heightened dysmorphia, when it is just your brain finding the most important thing to blame the anxiety on. Or in other words, brain says &#34;FFS panic!&#34; when really, it&#39;s just &#34;panic&#34;, and FFS is what happens to be on your mind a lot. (To be very clear, this is an example, and I bring it up because it is *quite common. Might not be your experience)
</p>
<p>
Is everything normal with hormones lately? I get terrible panic attacks when I fall out of schedule with Estradiol.
</p>
<p>
But really hon, imo, you look 🔥💥🔥.

This is definitely a body dysmorphia or low self-esteem type of deal. I didn&#39;t even notice most of the stuff you pointed out. I live in New York and if I saw you on the trains, I&#39;d just be like, &#34;Huh. There&#39;s a pretty blonde chick here. Probably 20-30. Wonder where she&#39;s going.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I notice you harped on yourself for the bone structure in your face; another thing I legit didn&#39;t even see. I don&#39;t think it looks weird? But if you
<em>
did
</em>
look weird... I kinda have to ask: who cares? Genuinely, why is it so important? Is it for yourself, is it more of a &#34;who would ever love me like this?&#34; thing... or something I&#39;m not thinking of? Because beauty standards are usually bullshit, anyway. If there&#39;s one thing city life has taught me, it&#39;s that people are diverse &amp; that&#39;s a beauty in itself. There&#39;s more to us than our outsides anyway, yk?
</p>
<p>
Take this gently as possible, but... I don&#39;t know what to say other than encourage you to seek more therapy, maybe. You&#39;re really pretty and still can&#39;t see that. And if you&#39;re breaking down every time you see some other girl, that is
<em>
sincerely
</em>
a very red flag for your mental health. Whatever support you&#39;re getting clearly isn&#39;t enough; this sounds really serious :,)
</p>
<p>
Best of luck, ma&#39;am. It can get better, I stg.

This resonates with me so much. I also feel like my my before was better than my after. I am not crazy about my surgeries. I miss how I used to look everyday. I wish I’d never touch my face. I have asymmetry in the ears forehead and nose. I didn’t before. All due to surgery gone wrong. Listening to your testimony and seeing your pictures I feel like maybe it’s not excactly how we see it honestly. You make me realize that maybe we are just having a hard time accepting our new face. In your case I feel like you look gorgeous in both before and after and I find you more feminine in the after. It makes me realize that I am too more feminine in the after and I am maybe focusing on the asymmetry and what went wrong instead of focusing that I still look great either way. I don’t know but I am 4 months post off. Every day I feel like I get glimpses of the old me and maybe she’s coming back. It could be so soon to tell. I hope you learn to love your new face even though not everything went as you wished. Don’t get hung up on it. I am also trying to do the same. So you are not alone. Even if it may seem like we are in the minority. It happens.

i think it depends on your the way you hold yourself, i think the third after selfie is the most fem you look, before or after. try to hold your head so that it brings out your good side. it might take a while to do but i think you find your results are better then you at first thought

Not saying anything bad about before, but… you look more feminine after surgery. This is all in your head. Maybe you thought surgery would turn you into a Victoria Secret super model? That’s not how surgery works and is what cis people propagandizes about surgery to makes girls like you feel less authentic for needing it. All surgery does for trans people is correct things. Makes you a version of yourself more feminine or masculine depending on who you are. It does turn you into a complete new person, just a new version of yourself. Go to therapy to learn to learn that new self.

Results are great, personally found FFS made my life harder in some ways, people stare for longer to &#39;figure me out&#39; because my face is pretty but I have clocky voice and shoulders
</p>
<p>
I think you&#39;ll be really pleased with it in a year or two, have you got all the feeling back again yet? I felt really uncomfortable without the full range of expressions/movement/feeling, still have a bit of numbness but it&#39;s much better

This makes me feel much better about disliking my results 6 months out. I’m almost certain that it’s dysmorphia in my case, and seeing someone with results as good as yours upset over them validates my experience.

People aren’t just being nice; you look great.

I think it’s normal and completely understandable to be freaking out a little but when something as major as your face has changed! Not just ffs but many people who go through plastic surgery experience this. Give yourself time to get used to your new look. Go easy on yourself. You look stunning!

Your after photos make you look almost identical to one of my cis workmates, and she&#39;s absolutely gorgeous in that girl-next-door way. You&#39;re beautiful babe.
</p>
<p>
Give yourself some time with your new look, it&#39;s hard to objective with one&#39;s self. I&#39;m a cis woman, and I&#39;ve always struggled with my face, thinking I&#39;m ugly, and have no understanding how I actually look. I&#39;ve found when looking back at photos of myself from more than 6 months ago gives me enough distance to be a little more objective. I&#39;m always shocked when I look back and think, &#34;whoa, I was actually cute in that photo.&#34; Maybe give yourself 6 month - a year, and look back at these photos. I think it may help you see what others are seeing: an adorable woman with a cute face and lush hair.
</p>
<p>
Be kind to yourself, darling.

FWIW, you&#39;re very beautiful! I know it sometimes is hard for us to see how beautiful we are bc all we can focus on are our imperfections... I get caught in that loop myself a lot. But girl, you have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about!

Yeah you look like a girl. Dysmorphia is a complete bitch, I stg my face changes substantially from day-to-day even though logically I know it doesn&#39;t. You look really good, and it sucks that the mental side of things is hitting you so hard rn

I understand how you feel then, a couple month after my FFS I felt like I made the worst mistake of my life.It feels like wearing a mask. It is because everything hasn&#39;t settled yet. It takes far more time to see the end result of it. It will be better I promise.

It can take over a year to fully recover from FFS and you&#39;re not even 3 months post op. Your results look good, you just need time to recover. If I remember correctly hair loss after hairline revision is normal.

I agree with many of the comments saying dysmorphia is at work here. I think you are not perceiving what we are. Your face after surgery does look more feminine, softer in feature, and without detracting any natural beauty from your face. I&#39;m sorry to hear you are struggling to see an improvement, but understand that you are going to zero in on details you don&#39;t like if you are looking for them, even unconsciously. I think you look great, and I gope you&#39;ll be able to see that as well.

You look very naturally pretty. If the bone on one side of your jaw is a tactile feeling then hopefully you can address it after healing is complete. In the meantime please seek help as you seem to be unable to perceive yourself objectively. Dysmorphia is a real disorder that actually really changes what you see. 💙💙

I’m sure I’m not saying anything that anyone else hasn’t mentioned, but I think it could be that you’re still in shock?
</p>
<p>
A lot of us are doing little things over time to change into what we want to be. Gradual is always subtle and it’s easy to forget where you started.
</p>
<p>
Doing FFS is a big change in a short amount of time. It’s perfectly normal to be alarmed because what’s looking back in the mirror isn’t what you’ve been seeing for a long time and doesn’t match what you saw recently.
</p>
<p>
Give it some time, it’ll sink in that that truly is the you you wanted to see! It’s always good to talk with someone you’re comfortable with and trust.
</p>
<p>
Big swings are we’re the rubber meets the road! Too many of us, myself included, are afraid of those big swings. Count yourself fortunate that you didn’t have any major complications or need revisions, and give yourself time to process where you are and where you want to go!
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to you!

Sister you’re so beautiful both before and after I think you look marvelous and I hope and pray you will see what we all do.  I know it is difficult for you to understand however you have in no way ruined your life.  Like wine women tend to age well I am much better looking at 59 than I was at  29.  Be safe and please don’t do anything that could really impede your path.

From the outside looking in, you look georgous. But the problem isn&#39;t how you look from the outside. Perhaps you put stock in the idea that ffs would make you feel better, and perhaps it simply doesn&#39;t, and you simply can&#39;t compute. I&#39;m not sure if this is really gonna help, but perhaps it will give you a different perspective. Anyway, I think your beautiful.

You look great!!! I didn’t even know this was trans surgeries until I read your story under the photo! I felt a similar way after FTM top surgery but I asked my family and friends they said it looks great :) so I really know that feeling like “did I fuck up?” . Over time your new body will feel more like home and you’ll be surprised!  but in my opinion you look very feminine and you have more of an angelic face now(softer look).  -Alex

You look really pretty both ways!!! I prefer the after :) You look more like a mellowed out girl it fits you. Like you have healthy weight in your face. It fits your face.

baby smoopiekins the transition between the old you and emerging you will be hard, excruciating and downright diabolical to the psyche, once again your future was left to an outside force that seemingly doesnt get it. but please take time to realize this is just a passing (nopunintended) moment and you WILL overcome it shining brighter than before. The woman you see before you took grit and determination to make it here today and to shame her for just being human for the rest of her life is a fate worse than death. You truly look great, and you will get used to the new mug, learn how to work it and eventually feel more yourself again than before. Give her time and show her compassion, shes a new woman! and overall just allow yourself the time to greave and let go. Its a big step in your life and will take a lot out of you, there may be regret, there may not. regardless— you have to make peace, for yourself and the future of queer people. If you decide to become a teacher you own your looks proudly, because the woman in all of these photos stands as a testament to how beautiful any one of us could turn out with our without surgery and i for one am inspired.

Before your jawline and chin were needing work and your eyes look like you are squinting. After your chin and jaw looks great and your eyes are so much more open. That scar from in your hairline is fresh and so you haven’t even begun to heal, you’ve got a year for everything to settle and the final results to become clearer. You jaw could simply be swelling and nothing more, so go easy with thinking it’s such a bad job. Your face looks so much better now, before it looked like you were covering as much as you could with your hair, and you may not want to wear your hair like that for the rest of your life. With a nicely shaped jaw, chin, forehead etc you can have your hair off your face or cut it short, and still completely pass in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
It seems like you are angry with your parents, so many of us don’t get to transition in our teens. But you look like you are barely into your twenties, so many of us are a lot further along the road than you and damp how I wish I could have started my transition even just 5 or 10 years earlier - I’m 50 next year and started days before my 48th birthday.
</p>
<p>
Of course you do you, but so many trans women will never get anywhere near to passing all the time, we just have to accept what life has given us. You are so much luckier than you realise. Honestly I thought this was a troll post at first out to get a reaction or just after free hugs. You look great, and you have a year of healing to get through yet.
</p>
<p>
You probably could do with more support from people offline, and if I can give you one piece of advice it would be stop taking selfies. It’s a really bad path to go down, you’ll find it harder and harder to be happy with how you look each time, and ultimately it serves no useful purpose. Skip them, use a mirror if you must, and get working towards your dream career - you’ll be just fab at it!

girl what!! i’m desperately trying to find the flaws you’re pointing out, and i don’t see any. you look cute and so feminine! 💓
</p>
<p>
i think you may “like your old self more” because that’s what you’re used to, but with time you’ll learn to love and appreciate your new beauty. therapy will help! :)

you look great; you probably just need more time for swelling to go down and things like that. i don’t remember what it’s called but you can get post-surgical skin treatments to reduce the after effects of surgery and allow your face to settle.

You look great before and after, but I do see the disproportion, there&#39;s always revision surgery, but give it time, it could just be swelling still

I think you&#39;re going through some shit that surgery can&#39;t help. It&#39;s kinda why I&#39;m having to hit the pause button. I&#39;m going through a lot of grief from the loss of my marriage, house, etc. And I don&#39;t think throwing my physical needs out of equilibrium will help anything. However I&#39;m fighting that my insurance won&#39;t be as awesome now that I&#39;m waiting until I can afford GCS and hair removal.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m struggling with the mental shit and the massive desire to be complete being put on hold

According to people I’m “unclockable” I’m not sure if I’ll ever feel that way but at the very least I’ve acknowledged most of my reading into my body image is dysmorphia rather than dysphoria. I suggest talking with a therapist at this point to maybe help work on your self image

Nah you look incredibly better after surgery. Just being honest. I could&#39;ve clocked you easily pre surgery but i wouldn&#39;t think anything of it now.

I get the sense this is the post surgery depressive spiraling I’ve heard about. Because I’m sure there’s lots here looking into FFS and will consider your results a huge success. Remember hair can be changed though it does suck to have to correct a procedure you’re not happy with; mentally and financially. And whatever bone was taken out could be replaced with a silicone piece.

Stop it. Your being way to hard on yourself.  You look like a young pretty natural woman. Your pretty and there&#39;s absolutely no hint of man on you anywhere.  I&#39;m being honest with you. I&#39;m 56yo and was lucky enough to just have to have ffs fillers just to soften me up and define m6 cheeks and I totally love how I look it just takes a minute to get use to myself when I see myself in a mirror it still catches me off guard.  I got that and permanent makeup all done back in June so it takes a bit to get use to.

So listen. We never ACTUALLY look like we think we do. That’s why when others take pictures of us at angles we can’t do ( or self selectivity won’t do ) with our phones it comes are a bit of a shock. Because we get a sense of ourselves from the pictures we see of ourselves. &amp; in modern times these are mostly taken BY ourselves too. You are suffering from an extreme amount of this. You no longer look like you from any angle you can take. This is truly freaking you out.
</p>
<p>
Answer. Try hard to stay calm. Take time &amp; just live with yourself and your face. Look at it for 1-2 mins maybe 4 times a day try &amp; internalise the idea that this is you. Really look. MY face this is MY face. As an outsider with only a moment to see you I immediately thought how much more feminine you looked afterwards. I thought oh oh you got it wrong Anna, it will be the 1st set that’s afterwards or something. Happily that’s not the case. This is not the disaster your telling yourself it is. I promise it’s not.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly right now is get some time passed &amp; our normalcy bias will do it’s magic. But you can also &#34;think&#34; it into a real crisis. If you don’t clamp down hard on those feelings of terror and despair. You must not let that happen. Take heart. I’m sure your friends &amp; family are on your side. It will be ok.

I believe from that “psychological” perspective, your experience is changing and coping with that change is harder because it’s a new one; things have never felt like this before. This feeling sounds closer to that of cis girls and women who experience body dysmorphia. Are you feminine? Yes. Do you consider yourself beautiful? That’s a question cis girls/women struggle with every day and that is a question that society forces on them/us. I think it’s multiple things. I think that you had an expectation for your surgery that was let down/different than what you wanted. I also think this is now more dysmorphia than dysphoria. I also think you look beautiful pre and post op. Welcome to cis-passing femininity and the newfound oppressions, challenges, and experiences.

You look freaking gorgeous though! No lie, I think you look amazing. If there&#39;s more you wish to be done, that&#39;s valid, but you should definitely try to separate your negative self talk from how you perceive yourself because you look

perfect

Girl you’re gorgeous.  I totally understand everything you’re feeling, but rest assured that you haven’t screwed anything up.
</p>

Please speak with a professional therapist about what’s

going on.  It sounds like your solution will be more of an inside job than outer.  But damn girl, your outer is beautiful.  Own it.  💖

I mean this with all the love in the world, but you&#39;re crazy 😅 you were attractive before, no doubt, but you were definitely masculine. I would&#39;ve been surprised if you weren&#39;t amab (sorry if that&#39;s not the proper term- I mean no disrespect!). That being said, you are absolutely gorgeous now, I mean that 100%. And I wouldn&#39;t clock you in a million years. Maybe you need to hear it a million more times, but I can&#39;t wait for you to finally accept and love yourself fully! You are gorgeous! I wish you the best 💕 and for you to go confidently into this wild, wide, beautiful world.

I&#39;m not seeing what you are seeing. Your facial symmetry looks good and your hair line looks good. You are attractive in all the pictures and look more cis in the post surgery pics. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe you that there is some asymmetry it&#39;s just not something that is visible in the photos.
