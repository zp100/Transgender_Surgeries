So i learned that my Medicaid just now included GRS to the policy and my urologist subsequently became my surgeon in the future.  Thing is, i never heard of him, nor do i know his experiences in GRS.  Has anyone had GRS done by him?

That&#39;s weird. I was just at my Doctor&#39;s this morning, we were talking surgeons (apparently there&#39;s a Dr. Witten/Whitten who&#39;s doing ??? surgeries in Louisville?) and even mentioned Gallagher and a couple others, but nothing about a new Indy cutter.

Yeah....Dr. Gallagher is no longer doing GRS, THANK GOD! Idk who dr Whitten though. But Dr. Joshua Roth claimed that his method is different than Gallagher’s. But no further details other than to wait until i hit 12months on HRT

I&#39;m not even aware of Gallagher&#39;s methods, the bad reports are enough for me to stay away. Roth didn&#39;t say what he does, just wait &#39;till month 13?
</p>
<p>
My doc mentioned that they&#39;d been at a lecture given by Toby Meltzer, and I told them about some of the lawsuits. They said in person he really came across as a guy with a huge chip on his shoulder, was really off-putting.

Oo boy, i guess i had to wait on my end. So you’re assigned you with dr Roth?  Gallagher’s way of surgery has been overwhelmingly and negatively criticized, i even saw some traumatic results from someone who had it done by her in Realself.com But as for Dr. Roth, i have never heard of his achievements and even reviews about his work are none existent...

I had peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty with Dr. Gallagher in Sept 2019. Dr. Roth was the second urologist there working with the urology chair Dr. Koch. Since I was one of three patients that they did PPV on last year, Dr. Roth was there to observe and participate as he will help do gender confirmation procedures in the future.  Dr.Gallagher did a great job. I had seen her as she had a video on YouTube expressing interest in using the peritonium. I brought a ton of studies and video links to her and discussed it in depth. She then had me see Dr. Koch as he was the urology head at IU. After seeing him he said the laproscopic part would be no problem as he and the urology staff there work in that area of the body weekly. He even said he had 3 prostate removals scheduled the next day that all went through laproscopic peritonium region. It took some more months before they did the first patient. I was the second. Dr. Gallagher was very helpful. Her and I emailed back and forth as I did not want penile inversion done as the external base of my surgery. She suggested I look into Dr. Suporn&#39;s Chonburi Flap technic. I found only basic descriptions of it but Drew up some sketches. She ended up doing pretty much exactly what I had drawn up.
</p>
<p>
Post surgically I had some skin that the stitches did not hold and had a bit of granulation but it cleared up in about 3 weeks. I had an issue with urethra tissue that she uses to line the bottom of the vestibule with also pulling through on one side do to swelling so last week she did a secondary labiaplasty to fix it all up.
</p>
<p>
So I know Dr. Roth will be helping with PPV in the future at IU Health University Hospital. I don&#39;t know what plastic surgeon will be doing the external part.
</p>
<p>
Also Dr. Gallagher has moved to Miami and is now in private practice with operating rights at one or more of the Miami hospitals.
