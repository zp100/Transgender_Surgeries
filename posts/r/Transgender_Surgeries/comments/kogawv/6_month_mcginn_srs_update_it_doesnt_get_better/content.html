Tbh, when I first saw your picture, my response was
<em>
thats a good looking vulva
</em>
. Reading through your comments about your concerns, I can see (at least for the ones which are visible in the picture) what you’re talking about.
</p>
<p>
I’m a Ting girl, and I had my surgery 2 years ago. After my surgery, I had a lot of swelling and hematoma, and when people told me that my vulva looked “great”, I couldn’t see what they were talking about. The hematoma went away within the first months, and the swelling slowly subsided, but as it did, it became lopsided - one side of my vulva remained substantially more swollen than the other, so badly that the crease where my labia come together on the mons turned sharply. I was concerned (to say the least!), but I trusted the feedback I was getting and the stories I’d heard from other girls, and did my best to be patient.
</p>
<p>
At 3 months post, my swelling was probably down by around 40%. At 6 months, it was probably down by around 80%.  It took until 1 year for the rest of the swelling to subside and for me to see my final results.
</p>
<p>
A few months ago, someone posted a link to a document where some doctors/scientists sought to measure/categorize characteristics of (cis women’s) vulvas, complete with pictures to demonstrate the diverse characteristics they found.
<del>
I’ve lost the link to it (and if anyone has it, please post it again), but
</del>
Here it is:
<a href="http://gynodiversity.com/uploads/Classification_of_the_anatomical_variation_in_female_external_genitalia.pdf">Classification of the Anatomical Variation in Female External Genitalia</a>
When i saw it, I went through every characteristic and found that my vulva was well within the typical ranges for every single one. That helped me so much in reducing my anxieties about whether my vulva was
<em>
enough
</em>
— whatever measure of “enough” I was using.
</p>
<p>
By conventional standards, my vulva isn’t perfect. It isn’t symmetrical, my labia minora are quite small, my clitoris is larger than most cis women’s; but
<em>
my vulva is perfect for me
</em>
.
</p>
<p>
I have full sensation, and it can do everything I need and want it to do. I can wear tight-fitting clothes and I don’t have to worry about whether to tuck or cover. And most importantly, my bottom dysphoria disappeared the day of my surgery and has not been back since.
</p>
<p>
By no means am I trying to tell you to “be happy with what you have”. If you can make changes which will improve your satisfaction with your vulva and vagina, then make those changes. I’m just trying to let you know that the results you have now aren’t the results you’ll have in 6 more months, and you might find that you are happy with what you end up with after that first year has passed.
</p>
<p>
I hope that your issues are resolved and that you are able to feel more at peace with your results.
</p>
<p>
Edit: added link for classification of vulvas

When I read your post I was like, “omg I know the link, let me find it!”  Lol. Well I finally found it and see that you did as well. It truly is a great page every trans woman should see. Because Vulvas do vary so much, even those result that aren’t the best at times fit within the ranges.

a few things going on here: i’ve got some hypergranulation tissue covering my clit which needs to be cut out. my labia are deformed/uneven. difficult to see from this angle but my mons is noticeably bigger than the rest of my vulva which awkwardly shows through underwear. there is generally a lot of discoloration and weird texture because of surgical complications and her use of scrotal tissue.
</p>
<p>
depth is 4.5” but with only enough diameter for a finger. thankfully no problems with sensation.
</p>
<p>
dr. mcginn has made it clear that there is nothing further that can be done to improve appearance, and limited options for canal size. i know this is a hot take on this sub but please stay away from mcginn. she has been horrible in following up with my complications and even just being respectful. i feel so much shame surrounding my genitals and i regret trusting her to do a good job.

I suspect you should leave this for at least a year and hope it goes away by itself, and be careful who you get to work on it if it does need fixing. I&#39;ve read it can be a risky area to work on.

Honestly it looks pretty good. You might try to get a second opinion if you’re unhappy with the results. Are sure more dilation won’t get you more width or depth? I haven’t had bottom surgery so I don’t know everything but but I was getting myself prepared to dilate for at least a year.

i haven’t stopped dilating, but at this stage i have not been able to make measurable progress. when they create your canal during surgery, they poke tiny little holes in the penile skin graft to increase stretch. dilation allows your body to heal the holes with more skin instead of healing together, i.e. largest vag possible. dr. mcginn said that my skin graft has now fully healed at the smaller size. so increasing dilator sizes is increasingly unlikely, but not impossible

Hey, I understand the explanation of the &#39;built in stretch factor&#39;, but skin is a pretty flexible organ, in general. It can be trained over time to stretch in some pretty amazing ways. Think: pregnancy belly, earlobe stretching, etc.
</p>
<p>
If you continued to dialate and gradually increased dialator size, would you not eventually get more size? That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard from other people online, that they&#39;ve been able to get width even after abandoning dialating for a long time.

I just read an article about “Robotic Peritoneal Flap Vaginoplasty” which can help get more depth for those who already have had a vaginoplasty. I was thinking of you. Maybe you should look into it.

Hi! I&#39;m a Dr McGinn&#39;s girl. Also had a surgery about 6 months ago. Very happy. The uneven mons stuff is there, however, it gets better over time. I haven&#39;t had any issues with her office.
</p>
<p>
Edit: interesting to see downvotes. I feel sorry that you had bad experience there. And I kind of understand why you don&#39;t want others to go there. However, everyone is different and likely to have different results. I  know other McGinn patients and they are happy to. By no means I say that you are the only one, but she clearly communicated the list of complications before your surgery. That&#39;s really saying that there is a chance of that and you may be the one who gets it. I also had granulation tissue in multiple places (she mentioned that it&#39;s a very common complication), and it has been solved by 1) silver nitrate 2) consistent application of hydrocortisone. Re depth and girth. I&#39;ve been religious about dilation. Yes, it was painful sometimes, but I strictly followed her guidelines. I think that improved my chance to be happy with my surgery. I really don&#39;t want to look blunt to you. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to extrapolate your experience (or mine) to others, but like I said, every one is different.

<p>
the reason i’m coming here to tell my story is because actually, i walked into surgery not knowing that this could happen to me. i double checked my notes from our consult, we discussed complications, but none were the ones i experienced. the scrotal tissue part, for example, was something that she later said is based off of prior anatomy. so, she could have mentioned this complication during my consult exam, but didn’t. i can’t forget being repeatedly deadnamed by her either :-/
</p>
<p>
i never argued that this is the experience of everyone. however, a prospective patient should be aware not only of the very real risks, but also the track record a genital surgeon has avoiding and addressing them (or not). i’m happy you were a lucky one, but not everyone is that fortunate, and this is not the place for you to invalidate the rest of us

<p>
First, thank you for taking time to respond and I do really hope you get back on track or at least get some improvement soon.
</p>
<p>
Second, I&#39;m not sure how I could invalidate someone by mentioning my and only my experience (before I had to add &#34;edit&#34;). If someone got a better experience than mine it doesn&#39;t invalidate me at all. Actually, I will be very happy for them like I&#39;m happy to see much younger folks here transitioning. I understand that may not be something you wanted to hear. But this is called a confirmation bias. But it&#39;s not in/validation.
</p>
<p>
Third, there are other points you misunderstood, but I don&#39;t really want to hurt you now as you already need support and those arguments will not make you feel any better.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, while in the consultation she may not mention those risks, likely she mentioned those risks to you and asked you to sign that doc in the pre-op room before you were wheeled into the OR. I get that not everyone may be thinking straight right before SRS. Historically, that wasn&#39;t the way that doc was signed. It used to be on Monday, 1 day before the surgery. In my case, she did mention those risks to me during the consultation.
</p>
<p>
Fifth, getting into the surgery, I understood that I may have some anatomy surprises that the surgeon may discover during the surgery and obviously I will not be able to answer what to do. Therefore, I had to assume that the doctor will have some freedom of action and those actions may not be well aligned with my goals.
<strong>
The last statement is extremely important for everyone who is considering SRS!
</strong>
This is something that the doctor who wrote my second letter for the surgery explicitly discussed with me and I kind of hadn&#39;t thought about before. It was a curve ball at my decision to pursue the surgery. In fact, I did have some problems with my anatomy and did get a surprise. But I accepted it. I understand it wasn&#39;t possible to solve that on the spot.
</p>
<p>
I hope by your 1-year appointment you get some improvement. I really wish you recover or find a way to get a revision you want.

I have seen that in quite some SRS results. Some opt to inject fat in a second stage to change that.

Yes, that&#39;s an option her office mentioned as a revision, but one should wait a bit on that for fat redistribution. Like I said in another comment, it takes time and it gets better over time.

I hate when people say they think it looks good if an OP says otherwise.  You don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t like it.
</p>
<p>
A revision could help.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping for.  We both have heavy granulation on the hood, were you not told to continue with silver nitrate treatments?
</p>
<p>
4.5 depth isn&#39;t uncommon.  It&#39;s possible to extend with PPT.  Width is supposed to be possible to improve with work for anyone.
</p>
<p>
So you can get this all improved, but you weren&#39;t lucky enough to have it done in one shot.  Honestly, it does come down to that.  Sorry if she treated you poorly, but mcginn is one of the best.  SRS is just so complex you put things in place and can&#39;t predict how it heals.

right, thank you. i didn’t come here to be invalidated or even for pity truthfully. this is just my story
</p>
<p>
to answer your question, i was not given silver nitrate and dr. mcginn didn’t apply it herself when i saw her recently - i’m not sure why

My gynecologist gave me a couple applications, check in with yours maybe.
</p>
<p>
I think our kind of stories are tough for people here to take.  Many who haven&#39;t started and don&#39;t want to believe that it&#39;s more common than safe spaces let on.  Thanks for sharing yours.

I&#39;m at about a year post-op (Avanessian) and can comfortably say that 1 yr is the standard of seeing &#34;final results&#34;.
</p>
<p>
My vag looks a lot different than six months ago, and I would say my labia minora hadn&#39;t really developed into what it is now since the last month or so. And very TBH, yours looks like a vagina (that doesn&#39;t mean you wouldn&#39;t want a revision later on for aesthetics). Avanessian doesn&#39;t even begin the discussion of having a revision till a year in.

Hey, I&#39;m at 6 months (Brassard), and I&#39;m curious what sort of differences you saw between 6 and 12 months?
</p>
<p>
At 6 months I&#39;m still seeing the sort of step between labia and mons, and the two side incisions + dimples give my vulva the &#34;smiley face&#34; effect. I don&#39;t consider it particularly upsetting, but it makes it look a bit different from a cis vulva. I&#39;m curious if the dimpling / step will soften over time.

I can&#39;t speak how yours will turn out since each surgeon and patient&#39;s recovery is unique to them.
</p>
<p>
For me the swelling went down a lot, and the labia became more defined. My incision scars are nearly invisible at this point.

As words of support. A cis vulva , in fact all vulva have natural variations.  Labia majora below mons can be seen in the wild.  I think you&#39;re beautiful. I would consult a different surgeon for your complications. As for overall esthetic though I&#39;m envious❤❤❤

Can&#39;t believe someone downvoted this comment. As a cis woman, I totally agree. In fact, I didn&#39;t realize you would be unhappy with your surgery until reading the comments. Looks normal to me (though I totally understand, I&#39;m not undermining your thoughts about how your surgery turned out).

With the mons issue. It takes a long time to fully go “down”. I’m about 2 years post op (different surgeon) and it’s only just started getting better

It looks amazing. Do you have full sensation? Are you able to orgasm? Are you still dilating.

I think it looks pretty good, but if you want to some changes, I would definitely get a second opinion. I&#39;m not sure where you live, but I had bottom surgery with Dr. Grugal at Align in SF. He is fantastic and the staff is wonderful.
