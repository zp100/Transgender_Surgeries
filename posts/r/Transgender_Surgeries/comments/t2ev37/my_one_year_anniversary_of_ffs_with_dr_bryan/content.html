Hey, Reddit!
</p>
<p>
Today is my one year anniversary, to the day, of FFS with Dr. Bryan Rolfes at Omni Cosmetic in Wayzata (Minneapolis), MN. (FYI, Omni is right now sort of rebranding and merging with a Chicago-based company called Pinnacle Dermatology, so you may see either or both company names in the months and years to come). I had a long 11-12 hour cocktail of FFS procedures and can very safely say that my experience from start to finish to one year later and beyond has been nothing less than amazing, transformative, and more gender affirming than I even thought was possible. For a little background, I am right now 46 years old and have been transitioning medically for about 3 years. I was 43 when I really started the FFS process, and by start I mean begin to figure out what I would or could do about feminizing the masculine features of my old face. And THAT started with a lot of research, education, and doctor selection.
</p>
<p>
I studied and read the accounts of other FFS patients in every online space I could find… Facebook, Discord, RealSelf, Google, Reddit. I especially paid attention and took note of the FFS outcomes of people whose primary features and trouble spots were similar to mine. Imo, my two biggest issues were my sloped brow and large, dominating nose. So I paid close attention to especially those girls who had similar areas of focus to see how their surgeries turned out. Once I did that, the things that were most important to me were 1) consistently good outcomes and reviews 2) personable, easy to work with doctor and staff 3) good post-operative care and communication.
</p>
<p>
Now, fangirl warning, I am absolutely over the moon in love with the entire experience, and truth be told the experience isn’t even over yet (more on that later). Dr. Rolfes was, without a doubt, exactly the right doctor for me. He was all the things I was looking for and so much more. He and the whole office staff of admin, patient coordinators, nurses, therapists, and the other doctors are just the most delightful bunch of people. They’re down to earth, ultra patient, utterly relatable, soft spoken, fun to work with, customer-focused. To frame the comfort level and sort of familiarity that Dr. Rolfes and Omni inspire, when I asked Dr. Rolfes what form of address he preferred, he casually replied whatever makes me, the patient, comfortable. Doctor, Doctor Rolfes, Doctor Bryan, or just Bryan if I wanted. He made it clear that he was there for me in whichever way made me most comfortable. It sounds like a small thing, and maybe it is for some, but for me that gesture spoke volumes. The morning of the surgery we chatted like old college friends about our families, we joked, we laughed, we talked about home improvement projects, progressive politics, and LGBTQ+ activism. I can’t think of a single interaction in the two years I’ve been working with Dr. Rolfes and the other folks at Omni that was not satisfactory and put a smile on my face. I was up in Wayzata just a couple months ago for a second surgery, BA and body contouring with a different Omni doctor (Dr. Chaudhry, also amazing), and I brought the whole office homemade cookies. It’s that kind of fun, light-hearted, enjoyable and satisfying but still 10/10 professional relationship that I have with Omni and they have with me.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rolfes listened carefully to my concerns and goals during our consultation. I was totally open to ideas and asked for his recommendations, too. He explained some procedures that I was not familiar with and answered all the questions I had about surgery matters, logistics, being an out of town patient, requirements for having a local caregiver, staying in the area, limitations, getting by with eating, daily life, healing timelines, returning to work, everything. I agreed with every last thing that Dr. Rolfes recommended for me for FFS. I received quotes for the procedures later the same day and was put in contact with Melissa, their insurance lady, who did an extraordinary job getting everything in order for me.
</p>
<p>
So, what was on my procedure list?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Forehead reduction with brow lift
</li>
<li>
Rhinoplasty
</li>
<li>
Lip lift with lip augmentation via fat grafting
</li>
<li>
Chin and jaw contour with masseter muscle reduction
</li>
<li>
Trachea shave
</li>
<li>
Fat grafting to the face
</li>
<li>
Facelift
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now, I know. Some of you might be looking at the facelift like, “Wait a second. You’re not supposed to do that with everything else at the same time.” Well? What can I say? I asked Dr. Rolfes about it during the consult, and I said the same thing some of you might be thinking. Aren’t you supposed to wait 4 months? 6 months? A year after the other FFS procedures before you do a facelift? This really should come as no surprise at all in a trans medicine space like this, but guess what? Every FFS is unique and they are not one-size-fits-all. Dr. Rolfes was confident that it would help me a lot. He said that his procedure of choice (the SMAS facelift) would easily last 10+ years and make the rest of his work really look good and pop. And c’mon… I was 44 years old at the time of the consult and my face and neck
<em>
looked
</em>
44 years old. My skin was healthy and smooth and unblemished, but it was saggy. Even if I were cis I would have benefitted from a facelift. Ultimately I trusted Dr. Rolfes and I’m so very glad that I did. It’s really hard to argue with the results.
</p>
<p>
My surgery and recovery was super smooth! I couldn’t have asked or hoped for it to have gone any better. I was on the heavy painkillers for 3 days and then graduated to acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I probably did many if not all of the things most others do and talk about here during recovery… eat soft foods. Rest as much as possible. Sleep with the head elevated. Some of my favorite recovery items I remember were Greek yogurt (high in protein), Jello, chocolate milk, and sorbet/sherbet. These cold things were especially soothing to my sore, swollen lips and mouth.
</p>
<p>
I had follow up appointments at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. I was absolutely in love with my results and it improved my life in countless ways. Dr. Rolfes managed to make the gender needle swing HARD to the feminine side of the binary for me and I enjoyed my life more and more every day because of it. That is not to say that every last thing healed exactly as planned, though, and
<em>
that
</em>
is a big reason why I wanted a doctor with whom I could forge an ongoing relationship. I figured that this was surgery, and it was a big surgery, no less. I thought it was only reasonable to expect that
<em>
something
</em>
was not going to go or heal exactly right. Maybe it was just a way to manage my expectations, but I went in thinking that something or other was not going to turn out or heal 100% right and might need to be corrected later. I was right, but thankfully they were all minor concerns that you would hardly even know about or see unless I pointed them out to you. Specifically, I have some cartilage bumps inside my nose from the rhinoplasty, an irregular, raised facelift scar behind one ear, and a tiny bony ridge on the bridge of my nose. These are small things. How was Dr. Rolfes and Omni about these little imperfections when I expressed that I would like them corrected? Dr. Rolfes wanted me to be happy and was eager to get everything fixed to my satisfaction. We first tried to fix things in an office visit, but after things healed up from that it was clear that the right thing to do was to go back to the operating room and really fix those things for good. We’re planning to do that later this year in a relatively short surgery.
</p>
<p>
I’ve included a LOT of pictures with this post that hopefully give y’all an idea of how things have gone these last 12 months. And for anyone wondering where on earth my hair went… lols. It was never there in the first place. I’ve been shaving my head smooth for 25+ years. I’m a super bald and super happy chick and I own that little detail just fine. The after pics of the before/after picture were exactly 7 days post-op when I arrived home. It was the same day of my 1 week follow up when the nose splint came off. The recovery pics are of me on days 0, 1, and 2 on the top, and days 4, 7, and 21 on the bottom. There are other pictures of me at 1 month, 4 months, 6 months, and more yet from more recently. I included trachea shave before and after pictures pointing out the tiny scar. And then, for fun, I included an advertising piece that Omni actually
<em>
put
</em>
me in. The way this happened was I sent them a big thank you letter with pictures and a magazine that I appeared in last summer for the wonderful experience. I was contacted by their lady who does marketing and she asked if I would be interested in actually appearing in some marketing of theirs. I was like, “Heck, yah!” So the day I went up there to see Dr. Rolfes for an office visit, she took a bunch of pictures of me and prepared a piece for the November issue of Minneapolis-St. Paul Magazine just in time for Transgender Awareness. There was no compensation involved whatsoever, but I was enormously flattered for what I felt was a big honor.
</p>
<p>
That’s basically the short story version of where I am today with my FFS experience exactly one year to the day after my life-changing, life-improving, utterly transformative and satisfying surgery with Dr. Rolfes and the folks at Omni. I hope this helps with the decision making process for some of you out there, and I’m happy to answer questions as I’m able if anyone would like to know anything else. Good luck and love to y’all!

I talked to his office a couple of days ago. The next available consult was in March of 2023, and surgery wouldn&#39;t be until March of 2024.

Hello, friend! And no, I don’t mind at all! Are you looking for a short and sweet summary or something juicy and in depth? And would you care to Reddit chat, DM, or go to another medium like Discord?

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rolfes explained before the surgery what to expect and he was spot on with just about everything. I had what I think is a pretty normal level of swelling and numbness considering the length of the surgery and the number of procedures that he did. I healed rather rapidly with no issues or complications
</p>
<p>
Jaw swelling can be very persistent and last anywhere from several months up to a year. I had the tiniest bit of numbness actually *inside* my jaw for about 6 months. It was neither outside on the skin or inside the mouth but *inside* somewhere. Tbh, though, it was extremely minor. I hardly noticed it unless I had a reason to think about it. Now at 12 months it‘s entirely resolved.
</p>
<p>
Scalp numbness is definitely a thing, too, that can last months to years. I was still halfway numb on the very top of my head until the 9-10 month point. It was a very small patch of numbness maybe 4 inches in diameter. Now at 12 months sensation has almost entirely returned. I’d say it’s like 95% returned.
</p>
<p>
Last is the underside of the nose. Those nerves are *still* waking up a bit, but I knew there was a good chance it would take a while. I have family and friends who have done non-cosmetic, deviated septum surgery, and they had exactly the same thing. It can take many months to a year or more for that numbness to really go away. Honestly, it isn’t that big a deal for me. It’s a relatively tiny area, sensation is probably around 60-70% of normal right now at 12 months, and I’m sure it will get better still in the months to come.

Thanks! 😃💕
</p>
<p>
Omni is an in-network provider with all the various Blue Cross Blue Shield state carriers, and (to my knowledge) out-of-network with everyone else. I’ve heard anecdotally that they will do letters of agreement (a mechanism by which an out-of-network provider will be treated as if they were in-network) in certain circumstances. Starbucks insurance, for instance, uses Aetna and Omni/Dr. Rolfes have processed those claims in the past on a case by case basis.
</p>
<p>
The insurance person at Omni is Melissa, and she is just a rock star. Even if a person elects to go to Omni as an out-of-network provider, pay for services upfront, and then seek reimbursement on the backend, Melissa will do everything in her power to help with that process.

Thank you so much dear! It’s just so hard to find doctors that will do FFS. I will definitely send them an email. Love and light to you dear

Right? For a medical group of very specialized and skilled doctors, nurses, and other staff, they are seriously just the most extraordinarily normal and down to earth people someone could hope to know. All that AND the level of care and the time they give their patients, just as you said, is almost unbelievable. It’s that good!
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bryan and everyone there at Omni will take such good care of you! I’m so excited for you! Just manage your expectations and the uncomfortable moments the best you’re able and you’ll absolutely shine! 😃💕

Hello, if I may ask. I am interested in getting a tracheal shave. Have you experienced any complications long term? Thank you in advanced.
