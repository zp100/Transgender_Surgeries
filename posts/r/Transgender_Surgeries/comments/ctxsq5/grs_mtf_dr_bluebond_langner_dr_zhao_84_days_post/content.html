Is that long enough to  be &#34;fully&#34; healed or are you still expecting some more visual changes?

They say it takes a full year for all the swelling to go down. I would think its most of the way there though by nowlike 90-95%? I see the Dr. again in a couple of weeks.

How did your followup appointment go? (I have a consult with Dr. RBB-L scheduled and am working on my surgery pkg in the hopes of getting on the cancellation list).

your hood looks so good! and pinker on the underside too - wondering if that&#39;s because you were uncircumcised or if that&#39;s somehow just due to their technique. Do you feel comfortable sharing?

It certainly does seem that way.  It definitely looks like this wait, the longest wait of my life, will be worth it.

Yup, I’ve had that running since 14 months.  It just got down to under 12 months and that at least made me feel a tiny bit better.

Thank you for sharing. I follow
<a href="/u/enigmabound" rel="nofollow">u/enigmabound</a>
and
<a href="/u/kateyhazard" rel="nofollow">u/kateyhazard</a>
for inspiration and am happy I found your posts. My consult w/Dr. RBBL is 2/21, and all the posts I’ve seen, such as yours only reinforce that I made the right decision. My insurance is lined up. I am working on my surgery package, have two of the three letters necessary and contacted the Papillon Center to begin genital electrolysis. Congratulations❣️❣️❣️❣️💕 Thank you for your bravery and willingness to support those of us working to achieve our best life❣️

In found your thread and had to ask how you handled her post-op dilation schedule. Taking three weeks off work will be hard enough, and 4x a day for the first six weeks just won&#39;t be doable for me.

Dilating sucks....But has gotten less so the further along I have gotten. I did 4X a day for 4 weeks after leaving the hospital, then 3x a  day for 3.5 weeks and have been on 2 x a day ever since. I didnt go back to work for 6 weeks post op though, I dont think 3 would have been doable for me.

Work on getting insurance, she won’t take patients without it, and it’s a good thing too because you’d have to be very well off to afford it otherwise. Otherwise, call her clinic and set up an appointment for a consult. If you call now you’ll likely get an appointment around the spring of 2021. That’ll give you time to be on hormones for at least a year, get electrolysis on your genitals started, get your primary care doctor set up, deal with any prior authorization with insurance, get your hormone letter, and your two surgery letters. Make sure you save up, because it’ll still be expensive with insurance, though the specifics will depend on your own insurance.

I have BlueCross BlueShield of La., and so far I&#39;m having to fight, beg and plead for everything they don&#39;t want to cover.
</p>
<p>
I have been on Hormones 16 months.  I am also currently taking electrolysis session for my face and neck, OMG does it hurt,
</p>
<p>
I go for an hour and tears are usually rolling down my face  by the end. She usually asks at that point, if I can go ten more minutes, and I do. But I cant imagine getting it down below.
</p>
<p>
What all needs to have hair removed down below?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the information and Congratulation&#39;s ❣️❣️

I have a consult coming up with Dr. Geolani Dy at OHSU in Portland, Oregon. From what I can gather she just came from NYU and helped Bluebond-Langer &amp; Zhao develop the Robotic Pullthrough method they used on you. Did you hear anything about her during your process?
