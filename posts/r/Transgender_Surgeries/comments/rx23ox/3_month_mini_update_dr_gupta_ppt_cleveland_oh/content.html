Things are looking and feeling great! Finally starting to get good sensation, the swelling going down, sitting is easier, dialators are getting bigger in size. Please feel free to ask if you have questions.

Hey I’m a pre op trans girl in the Ohio area scheduled with dr Gupta, I just wanted to say THANK YOU FOR SHARING!! I could barely find any photos of post PPT at all and most of the ones I found were very gruesome looking :/ but this is incredibly helpful and reassuring. You really look amazing and I’m so so excited
<sup>
^
</sup>
thank you so much!!! 💕

It is a very good result, your vulva looks very natural, I have some questions about your experience with PPT (well, there are a lot of them), could you please help me? I plan to undergo this technique (or the non-inversion technique): Did you undergo the hybrid technique (where half of the vagina is skin and the other half is peritoneal tissue) or the full technique (where the entire vaginal canal is peritoneal tissue)? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? Are you satisfied with your results? Are you planning to have a revision surgery (is a very good result and you still don&#39;t heal completely)? And if you plan to hace one, What would you improve your result with one? What is your vaginal depth? How is self-lubrication? Do you shower or is there some degree of self-cleaning in your vagina? How have the dilations been?, That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

Phew that&#39;s a bunch!! Let&#39;s do it!
</p>
<p>
I had a full PPT
</p>
<p>
How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity?
</p>
<p>
I think she looks great, I think the only time it looks weird to me is when I crouched down, I don&#39;t have much inner labia yet (I see it forming slowly as things swell down) but all in all it&#39;s great IMO
</p>
<p>
Sensitivity is finally starting to come around. For the first few months you couldn&#39;t touch anything it was a lot of soreness and pain but I also had a bad complication where I had tearing on the inside and outside.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been able to cum 3 times, one I was scared cause it was a month in and I needed to see if I had the ability to, it hurt it wasn&#39;t fun, but I got there somehow and was sore over the next few days. The other 2 were this week much better but still hard to get there but not as much soreness either
</p>
<p>
Boyfriend had a taste like 3 days ago, first off that feels out of this world, and he also said he noticed no difference other than maybe not as wet as one would be.
</p>
<p>
Are you satisfied with your results?
</p>
<p>
It feels like a long road to where I&#39;m at, ( it&#39;s been 3 months dummy stop rushing things) but I&#39;m starting to feel more and more at home with it. I love it. At first even with the complications I was very happy and at peace.
</p>
<p>
Are you planning to have a revision surgery? I don&#39;t believe I will, I&#39;m happy I already had a complication skin graft surgery and that was pretty torture for a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
What is your vaginal depth?
</p>
<p>
As in the picture you can see I&#39;ve worked up to the last dot on the green dialator, I believe that is 6&#34;?? Someone feel free to correct me on that.
</p>
<p>
How is self-lubrication?  It&#39;s still recovering so I still have some discharge but the bleeding is all done (finally) so I can&#39;t really answer too much on this. Lube is always a good idea anyways.
</p>
<p>
Do you shower or is there some degree of self-cleaning in your vagina?
</p>
<p>
Surgeon has me specifically douche once per day to clean out the
</p>
<p>
How have the dilations been?
</p>
<p>
Good I&#39;ve been a bit sore as I&#39;ve gone up in size very recently but other that that is been great. At least since the skin graft.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps!!!

Honestly always been curious how just walking around feels? Physically and mentally. Sorry if it seems like a silly question.

Mentally, I&#39;m not checking my leggings or sweatpants anymore when the wind blows to make sure it&#39;s not a lump. It&#39;s so releasing of anxiety for me.
</p>
<p>
Physically it&#39;s great I can&#39;t wait to get back to my dancing. I&#39;m going to do it with out worry anymore on stream!
