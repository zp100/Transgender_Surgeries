Good luck! I just had FFS a week and a half ago, so here are a few things that jumped out to me:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
in the pre-surgery check-in with the surgeon just review any soecifics of what looks you&#39;re going for. There were a few particularities for my nose that I went over that were a little unusual, and the surgeon gave them some extra attention. Everything turned out wonderfully.
</li>
<li>
make sure you&#39;ve got about about two weeks of liquid/very soft foods ready for you. I only just started back on anything that required chewing in day 10 of recovery. If you&#39;re having anything done for your trachea swallowing can also be very painful for the first day or two afterwards.
</li>
<li>
get bendy straws as the swelling is the worst during the first few days that will go a very long way to making getting nutrients in easier.
</li>
<li>
if possible, plan to have someone to help you wash your hair once you can again. It&#39;s going to be a mess after the surgery, and it&#39;s going to take multiple washes to get at all clean from dried blood and sterilizing fluids from surgery. Getting things combed out and dried is a slow and delicate process. Having a second set of hands to help with that makes an huge difference.
</li>
<li>
if you can get 2 or 3 gel face masks and cold wraps constantly cycling those so you&#39;ve almost always got cold applied on over the first few days is a big assist with pain relief and swelling.
</li>
<li>
talk with the surgeon about what you can to try to keep your nose clear enough to breathe. If you&#39;re getting rhinoplasty you&#39;ll likely have gauze packing in for at least a day or two, but even once that&#39;s out there will be a lot of blockage from dried blood and mucus. Having to mouthbreathe was f&#39;ing torture for me (also constantly apply chapstick). Saline spray and very gentle use of q-tips soaked in hot water to swab out blockages in the nostrils was and huge help.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Just be as gentle with yourself as possible during recovery. Even once the pain subsides and the swelling starts going down enough to look human again you&#39;ll likely feel like you can get up and about, you&#39;re still very likely to get tired easily and start running down. Your body will still be using a lot of resources for healing, so just don&#39;t push it.
</p>
<p>
So very excited for you! I hope you&#39;re thrilled with the results.

Good luck! You&#39;ll do great. :-) I really like Dr. Satterwhite and I&#39;ve seen a lot of awesome results by him. You&#39;re in good hands!
</p>
<p>
Just try not to stress yourself out too much.  Treat yourself to something nice for dinner tomorrow night since you&#39;ll have to fast after midnight. Take time to relax and be nice to yourself.

Are you also doing jaw contour ? If so, make sure u eat ur favorite foods now before surgery because u won‚Äôt be able to eat solid food for awhile. Other than that, make sure u follow doctor advice on wound care. My wound actually healed pretty fast :) good luck and congratulations !
