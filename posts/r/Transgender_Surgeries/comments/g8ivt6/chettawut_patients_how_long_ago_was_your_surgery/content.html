I am almost 3 months post-op and still religiously doing 50 min dilations thrice a day, but I am curious as to what other girls might be doing and when they altered their dilation schedule.

I had my surgery in July 2017.
</p>
<p>
As a result of regular sex, I am able to go very long periods of time without actually dilating and still manage to maintain depth. However, I have committed myself to doing it a minimum of once a fortnight, irrespective of whether I’m having sexual relations or not. Since lockdown though I have upped it, as I haven’t had sex in nearly two months. I am now dilating once or twice a week. More than anything, to pass the time.

That is very helpful info! At what point during recovery did you stop doing 50 minutes thrice a day?

Honestly, I am not too sure I am a case study to follow...
</p>
<p>
I’d say not too long after returning from Thailand. However, I maintain that the fact that I started on No. 4 much earlier than anticipated, negated against this.

I still haven&#39;t tried #4, so maybe I will try shortening my dilation time once I am comfortable with it. Thank you!

Again, I really wouldn’t follow my recovery.

How are you in of yourself? How are you adapting to your new body?

I am really happy with how natural things look and how quickly my body was able to recover, while keeping my depth. I got surgery as a 20 year old and I think it was the best time I could have gotten it - mentally and physically. And Chett was very respectful and considerate, despite me only just being an adult in Thailand. Nurse Sri was the sweetest person I&#39;ve ever met as well lol.

I was 19 when I had my surgery, so I can identify with this so much.
</p>
<p>
I remember being struck by how keen Chet was too ensure that my surgery went as well as possible, he seemed to understand the magnitude of this for a younger person. In fact, I remember him saying ‘this needs to work for 60 years, so I do good job’

That is so sweet! I bet you felt so relieved to hear that! Personally, in the US I have never had a healthcare professional be so respectful. When I went for my final check-up, he told me that he was happy how everything turned out with my frame and it made me glad to hear that my body took to his method. The whole surgery was so &#34;full circle&#34; for my transition, since I read about him in &#34;Refining Realness&#34; in 2014, since Janet Mock went to him in 2001-2003!

You know, I didn’t know that up until too recently. Has he ever confirmed it?

Neither party has confirmed it, but she wrote that she went to &#34;Dr. C&#34; and he has been doing surgeries since 1997, so it must be him

A few days away from 2 months. Maintaining 3 times a day 50min. I&#39;ve had slight complications from a tear at the entrance of my vaginal canal, twice. This hasn&#39;t stopped me from dilating, but I have only been able to maintain 0 and 1, I can&#39;t size up for awhile.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll definitely be doing 3x a day 50min for the full 3 months. Hopefully, once I&#39;m healed more I can make my way up to 4 fast.

I hope you heal well! As long as you can reach full depth with 0 and 1, then you don&#39;t need to worry.

Yeah! 1 is really easy for me at this point, i&#39;d have been on 2 a long time ago if not for the tear. Its healing slow though, so I&#39;ll take my time as needed.

The hardest part of dilation for me was finding the right lube. Sutil Luxe is fantastic if you need a new lube!

Looks interesting. Glycerin free which is good.
</p>
<p>
QC actually works just fine for me, I haven&#39;t had any complaints. But having options for when I run out is good.

I had literally 5 UTIs in a row until I switched off of otherwise completely reasonable yet glycerin-based lube (ID Glide), Glycerin-free is super super important

Not the first time time I&#39;ve heard tha 5th story to a certain extent. Sticking t ok glycerin free lubricants seems to be a good rule for healing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been told other lubes are fine once your healed, but I will most likely stick to what I&#39;m used to at that point anyways.

I had my surgery back in August 2017 (I think lol) and I’m dilating once or twice a month, in saying that I am having frequent sex.

What was your routine like around 3 months? Did you ever end up using #4?
