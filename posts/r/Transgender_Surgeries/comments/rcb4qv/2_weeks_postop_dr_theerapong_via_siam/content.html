</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/r70t2b/various_pics_after_srs_with_dr_theerapong_8_days/">This is what I had last week
</a>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I noticed some major differences. I actually don&#39;t need painkillers now, except when I&#39;ll sleep ( just to make sure that I don&#39;t feel any pain at all), and before dilation due to blister on the lower right side of my inner labia.
</p>
<p>
Swelling has gone down on one side of my labia. the blackish part is decreasing too. One thing that no one talks about was itching down there. I know that it&#39;s a normal part of healing wound, but I didn&#39;t expect it to itch this early. I can feel my labia btw, and my clitoris is oversensitive too. Not as oversensitive as last week, but It&#39;s still oversenstive. I can actually see my clit when I open my labia widely :D
</p>
<p>
I had an appointment with Dr Theerapong yesterday. He said that the black part will be gone in approximately two weeks. I myself think that I&#39;ll be healed when I get home on the 29th.
</p>
<p>
My stamina is not 100% back, but I underestimated myself. I think I can actually take short trips now if I wanted to, but I just want to rest a bit more. Today, I noticed that I can walk more normally. I can sit with the donut pillow on the chair. It&#39;s still uncomfortable to sit without it.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Edit: Siam Transformation is the name of Becky and Cherry&#39;s company. They are the ones I have always been in touch with before, during, and after SRS.

If it doesn&#39;t heal I recommend to book a hotel room nearby hospital and stay there until it heals.

It will heal. The nurse told me that she&#39;ll remove that Black thing in about 7 - 14 days. I think I&#39;ll be completely healed outside before i go home

Why did you go through a medical tourism company? Very few people do that.

Had communication problems with Interplast. I think Siam Transformation is more of an aftercare provider. I sensed that they actually care for their patients and decided to have PPV with Dr Theerapong. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a medical tourism company since two of them are actually nurses.

Sure looks like a medical tourism company. There&#39;s a number of them in Thailand and elsewhere. They often get paid by the surgeons. I&#39;ve no idea about this company.
</p>
<p>
Dr Theerapong likely doesn&#39;t have many foreign patients, at least not westerners, so he&#39;s probably not very organized for them. I can see the benefit in this case.
