I am so terribly sorry that this has happened to you. We are such a vulnerable population to having something like this happen and frequently don&#39;t have the resources to go elsewhere and to another surgeon, many of whom don&#39;t want to fix other&#39;s mistakes. It is so important that we know how to choose the best person to do our surgery of any the kind we need. I frequently have long discussions with my patients over the this topic which if anything is more important now that many surgeons are jumping into this surgery partly because some insurances now cover it. A surgeon&#39;s training, experience and results are so important as is what will they do with any complications or unhappiness with results are all important, more than how fast they can get you in. What are your expectations and are they realistic should be covered. I tell people to read the few books written on the subject of gender surgery as well as research the surgeons (and their people and place of surgery) on Reddit, Facebook, etc. and if they can directly talk to those who have had surgery. This is what I did and highly recommend for others. Again I am so sorry this happened to you, but nonetheless, maybe not immediately, most poor outcomes can be fixed.

Thank you so much for your replay. Yes, we are a vunerable population. I hope I can get things fixed.

It’s illegal to charge for medical records.   Check the law.

Hugs and support here for you dear!  Nothing wrong with posting something that is the truth!  If he doesn&#39;t like it then he should think carefully about what backlash looks like when he mistreats patients which rely on him for support!!

I used him for large volume electrolysis. I did have some issues with him being kind of (I kind of want to say the word &#34;brutal&#34;) brisk with the hypodermic needle. Do not recommend Z. Also some other shit he said and did. But seriously, in Illinois you should get some ACA insurance and go to Northwestern or Rush and get all fixed up. I&#39;m thinking you might need to heal for a year before you go under the knife again, so you&#39;ll have time to get scheduled by then if you get cracking now. ACA is accepting enrolment now.

He is a prick. I’ve left reviews of him because I got electrolysis at his facility. He gave me unsound medical advice and I’ve considered bringing a complaint against him to the medical board. Now seeing he is treating you like this I think I’ll do just that. A honest and fair review of services received is not defamation!

Fuck that douche. I’m having FFS and a few other procedures. That piece of garbage is on my own blacklist of horrible Drs. He’s not the only one, but the only aggressive one attacking his patients.

Throwaway account.

<p>
I&#39;m so sorry. He did my BA many years ago. 10 - 20 years ago, he was one of the few surgeons who would work with the trans community and was respected as a good surgeon. He was always a sexist pig. I honestly thought he was retired. Apparently, he should be.
