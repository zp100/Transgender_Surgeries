You&#39;re going to have to let your body heal before you worry too much. Inflammation is going to make everything look waayyyyy different. Also, it is perfectly normal to have some tissue slough off in the healing process. Try not to stress it. Give yourself some time to heal before you get too hung up on how things seem. More than likely, you&#39;ve never had something this major to heal from yet. You&#39;re ok, hun.

So since I posted it’s gotten a lot yellower and moved closer to the vaginal opening.
</p>
<p>
I made a new post about it but I think it’s just slough?
</p>
<p>
You’re right that this is the most major healing I’ve ever had to do, and I’m normally the person who obsessively researches everything in advance so not knowing what this is exactly is freaking me out :/

I took a glance it looks like its further along healing to me. I will also say that I had quite a bit of granulation, which is fairly common and can produce some discharge that could be adding a bit to the texture and color. It&#39;s possible that you have a bit of that as well -- which would be perfectly normal.
</p>
<p>
This all said, there&#39;s so much more that your doctor and their team will be able to do if there is anything major happening. If you start to experience new pain, or new discomfort and feel concerned, I would absolutely call their office and see what they say. I do remember you saying that your doctor had seen what you described in your initial post and that they hadn&#39;t mentioned it. I think there&#39;s a good chance that they were aware of this and that it didn&#39;t raise any concerns. The healing looks good to me as on outside and somewhat objective observer.
</p>
<p>
Just a couple things regarding mindset during this process, looking at your wounds feels like you&#39;re getting new information. However, you have never seen your body in this configuration, nor with this amount of tissue that needs to heal. You are going to be fairly biased in how you interpret what it looks like. Especially given that you are exhausted and in pain. Both of those factors will change how you interpret all kinds of information. In my experience I found the change in visual to be profound. So what I will gently suggest, is that if your doctor didn&#39;t think anything was wrong, you should trust them, and get some more rest before probing the area just yet. I would also make sure that you are eating enough, drinking plenty of fluids, and making sure that you are using your pain management effectively. Take those meds before you start to experience increased pain. It will help a lot.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve got this! Also please feel free to touch base with me. I&#39;m happy to say all of this again if you need it &lt;3

Are they covering your vaginal opening? It could pass as remnants of the hymen which is pretty normal to have but I understand being upset about that extra tissue. But like another person said, things will look totally different once you&#39;re further in your healing and this might look different too
