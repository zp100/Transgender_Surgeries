In January 2024 I had SRS using PPT with laparoscopic technique at Kamol Hospital in Bangkok. The surgery was performed by Dr. Kamol.  Three months post surgery I had a checkup with my gynaecology and she said the result was one of the best she had seen and that I have healed well with no complications.  My experiences at Kamol hospital are mixed at best. The surgery result is amazing and I cannot complain regarding that.  The pre and post surgery care at the hospital, however, was not so great. Information leading up to surgery was very sparse. I arrived in Bangkok Sunday. I was informed that the surgery was to take place at 10 AM Wednesday. On Monday I had checkups, which went fine.  I had a meeting with Dr. Kamol. Communication wasn‚Äôt the best, but he had a translater present. I was informed to check in Tuesday. Once I got checked in, I was left to my self in the Hospital and I didn‚Äôt know why I had to be there this early. I had to go look for some staff who could tell me what was going to happen. I was not informed that I had to have cleaned my bowels.  On the day of surgery I was very tired and exhausted from not having any food intake and the bowel cleaning. An hour before surgery (which was moved to 1pm) the staff arrived with a lot of legal documents for me to sign. I was not capable at the time to read through the paperwork. Some of which stated that any mixup needed would be covered at my own expenses.  I gambled and signed the paper. I was not in a state where I could make an informed decision and the hospital should have giving me the paperwork in advance to read through.  When I woke up from surgery I was told that ‚ÄúSurgery OK‚Äù. I was in quite some pain on the first day and the staff did not administer enough pain medicin despite multiple requests.  I could not feel the morphine at all. The staff in the observation room were sleeping and got mad at me when I woke them to get assistance.  Throughout the whole post surgery care I felt the nurses didn‚Äôt listen and never once informed me about what was going to happen. Every time I asked about concerns they would say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal‚Äù. This also happened when I had my kateter removed and I raised the concern that I didn‚Äôt think I could empty my bladder. They said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal‚Äù. A day later I was rushed to the hospital and had more than a litre in my bladder. They had forgotten to give me antiinflamatory medication when I was signed out.

If you decide to go to Kamol Hospital I would recommend contacting Jaime Lee (WhatsApp: +66 65 839 0418) and have her be your agent/liaison. I hired her during my stay and she was an incredible help. She talked to the hospital staff for me and she knows what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and what is a concern. She helped me a lot through the goodness of her heart. I then decided to hire her as I wanted to gratify her for her work.

I highly recommend contacting Jamie Lee if you&#39;re set on Kamol! There is absolutely no customer service, no communication, and once your bills is paid, your coordinator disappears. She is the only bright spot and voice of reason at the hospital.
