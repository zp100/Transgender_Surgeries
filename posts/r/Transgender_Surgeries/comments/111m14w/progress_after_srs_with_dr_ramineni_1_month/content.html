That’s really good! What technique did you get and did you have to get electrolysis?

Just make sure you get checked up frequently to make sure you have no internal hairs. Electrolysis is always needed, even if the surgeon says they do follicle scrapping and hair removal is not necessary, it almost never completely gets rid of the hair by doing just that, every surgeon needs to make sure the patient has significant hair removed, especially if its penile inversion.

Maybe that’s true for US and Thai surgeons but here in Germany they don’t want you to remove any hair before surgery. The surgeon I’m going with even told me that it’s best if their patients didn’t have hair removal at all. I spoke to multiple women who had srs and they didn’t have a single hair inside their vaginal canal and they never had electrolysis done.

It doesn’t happen to every patient. But I have seen several who have had internal hairs grow back because everyone’s body and hair growth/cycle is different. I just know hygiene wise to be safe is to make sure to get as much hair out of the way as possible, because if there is internal hairs it’s going to be near impossible to remove them. Having Sigmoid Colon or PPT is the best option to avoid having that possible regrowth.

My surgeon explicitly forbids their patients to have electrolysis prior to srs. They never had problems with hair growing in the vaginal canal. They are doing this surgery for 25 years so I’m confident that it’s true. There is not a single report of their patients with that kind of problem. The surgery team removes the layer of skin that has hair follicles in it and also does some kind of meshing to the skin. It’s not the standard PI tho.

That’s awesome if no one has had any issue. I know some surgeons in the US who do follicle scrapping and a few patients have reported some hair regrowth, nothing super alarming just a few hairs. I’m just nervous about having any kind of issue so I’m making sure to have the area cleared. My surgeon recommends 6-9 months of hair removal and I’m getting PPT

I heard those stories too and based on that I would totally do electrolysis. Especially if I had srs in the US or UK. Just wanted to mention that somehow it’s a different story with surgeons around here. They have different requirements.

Yeah and different methods, but I also know that everyone’s body is different as well.

Amazing. You certainly healed better than I at that stage! Your surgeon&#39;s an artist!
