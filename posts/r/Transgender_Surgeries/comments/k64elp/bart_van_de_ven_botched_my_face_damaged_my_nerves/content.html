For the people that look at this post, there are a couple of things to add based on how Van de Ven botches faces. First, he always goes too far in terms of shaving the forehead and here in OP‚Äôs case you can clearly see the eyes are overdone. Second, if you notice the slight double chin and compare it to the before, its something he us famous for. The double chin is a direct result of his malpractice in the chin, which he always overdoes and goes against what the patient wants (mind you this could be considered a criminal offense on multiple countries) and last but not least, the nerve damage is a direct result of his malpractice.
</p>
<p>
Please don‚Äôt defend this mediocre piece of crap of a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
OP, if you are able and willing to proceed, I would suggest to lawyer up and ultimately go look for a different surgeon (FacialTeam is great) to try and look for a solution if possible. I know this sucks and I really hope that Van de Ven will rot in prision.

I totally agree. The consultation I had with him was scary. He does not listen...does not take your concerns and instead he tries to manipulate and to convince you of a twisted reality. He goes against your wishes. Pure narcissistic traits.  The good news is that narcissists can never change the true reality. I decided to go somewhere else.  His license should be immediately removed.

Hello, I had my 4 months post op consultation with Dr Bart Van de Ven, and expressed all my issues such as damaged nerves, bulging and hardening of the jaw and chin plus crooked nose. He shouted at me when I mentioned to him I&#39;m not happy with the result. He also said his work on me is a &#34;miracle&#34; and &#34;godsend&#34; and I should be thankful for it. I think NOT, as my nerves are damaged and he TOOK so much bones off my jaw WITHOUT my CONSENT instead of just a little on the chin alone. I have many functional problems since and it was not worth it. Dr Bart Van de Ven has the worst attitude, has no skills and is NOT to be trusted. I now look worse, older and BONELESS.

From everything I&#39;ve seen about this guy he is a narcissistic, unprofessional, quack. You should absolutely sue for medical malpractice.

He took off more bone from your jaw without consent? Wtf. So you were just doing your chin and leaving your jaw the way it was and he went and did that anyway ???

If he performed surgery on your jaw, and you didn‚Äôt request it, that should be the headline. Because botched can be subjective.

Not sure this will make you feel any better,  but after my FFS I lost a significant amount of sensation on my right side and it did not come back until almost 15 months later. (Different surgeon, different many things). So hang in there, nerves can take a really long time to reconnect and make sense of things.

I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. I honestly don‚Äôt think you look botched or older from this angle, looks like he took quite a bit of bone but your face looks pretty good I think, I wouldn‚Äôt guess you had work done. But I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre not happy with your results :(

I&#39;m so so sorry that this happened to you! The real tragedy here is the loss of feeling and the way your surgeon is treating you. If this isn&#39;t what you asked for you&#39;re entirely within your rights  to be angry and to pursue action against him. The fact that he called it a &#39;miracle&#39; is an astounding level of ego. This is a pretty mediocre result... He could have been much less aggressive and accomplished a more stunning transformation imo. It&#39;s like he didn&#39;t know when to stop.
</p>
<p>
If it makes you feel any better, I don&#39;t think you look botched in terms of aesthetics. He for sure could have done a better job; your brows are especially jumping out at me as being overdone, and idk why he changed your jawline and chin so drastically. But it&#39;s an &#39;ok&#39; result, purely from a cosmetic viewpoint. You don&#39;t look noticeably artificial or plastic. I don&#39;t think people would think you have had surgery if they didn&#39;t know beforehand. Again, I&#39;m giving you an honest opinion and I hope it helps you to feel more confident. I really don&#39;t want to come across as trying to hugbox or downplay your feelings.

I agree that you don&#39;t look botched at all. I really liked the projection your chin had, but the good news is that you can have that again with some fillers. The forehead and nose honestly look very good to me.
<br>
You don&#39;t look artificial. You were beautiful before and are beautiful after.
<br>
The fact he reacted this way is wrong and mind blowing.

I&#39;m really sorry.. Could we get a frontal view? It&#39;s hard to see how it&#39;s botched in the way you describe from this angle, in both you look pretty. Do you find that things have gotten better in the longrun in terms of regaining sensation? What&#39;s the usual recovery time? By all means, you should file a lawsuit him if you aren&#39;t happy. Especially if this was paid out of pocket. Perhaps you could get a revision, just done by another surgeon. I wouldn&#39;t go back to him, especially if he yelled at you and went against your request. Since you are young, which is apparent from these pics, your skin may firm itself as it heals. Most recoveries take a year or two to see the final result, maybe in this case too

I am so sorry to hear. I could not imagine going through this. :( Please bring this monster to justice. It seems like he has a &#34;GOD&#34; complex. How dare him go on like this and hurting people along the way. You need to some how speak to others who have had the same happen to them and keep aal receipts. Form a class action against him. Rubbish human he is to keep on botching people. I wish you well. &lt;3

Before you get too discouraged, remember that recovery from FFS takes time. A lot of time. It took at least 6 months for my swelling to be almost gone - even though I was SURE that at 2 months it had nearly completely subsided. I only recognize how much swelling was still present now when I look back at the pictures. The same goes for recovering sensation - I was still recovering some sensation up to a year (that I noticed) after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just trying to say - don&#39;t give up hope. Things WILL continue to improve. Swelling WILL go down. Sensation WILL return. Maybe not fully - but it will improve. I probably only ever recovered 70% of my chin feeling, but I don&#39;t really notice that anymore. I&#39;ve got a weird thing now where when I pluck my left eyebrow, I feel strange tingling in the top of my head (lol), I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll ever go away.
</p>
<p>
I definitely spiraled into depression and hopelessness regarding my results at a point in my recovery, and it took some good friends to pull me out of it. Since that experience, and with every surgery I&#39;ve had thereafter, I really really really try not to read into my results before at minimum six months.
</p>
<p>
FWIW - I think that you do look great, and absolutely passing (at least from this single picture). Hopefully the area under your jaw is just swelling and subsides in time, and I do agree that he was too aggressive on the chin reduction. I am sorry that you are struggling and that you have had a negative experience.
</p>
<p>
Full disclosure: I did have FFS at 2Pass Clinic from Dr. Bart Van de Ven in 2018. But I am really not trying to shill here. Just hoping to share some advice from one FFS patient to another.

I recently started reading about ffs, I&#39;m looking at different surgeons but, for some reason I can&#39;t find Van de Ven&#39;s publications so far but for some reason some trans women in the UK keep mentioning him as a hero.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s quite scary because I consider ffs for me.

I assume the picture on the left is the before and the one in the right is the after? Based on the forehead being less bumpy. I agree with you that on that pic you do look older on the right. And the chin looks like it dropped a little. Looks like mine which was done by Bensimon in Montreal. Now I need some hardware to fix it. Sorry I don‚Äôt mind to be critical of the work. I‚Äôm just analyzing what I see. From profile I think your chin was more feminine before. Not sure if you had it done.
</p>
<p>
When you relax your mouth now and look at the mirror do you see all your bottom teeth? Like a Pacu fish? If you do than he did the same thing that Bensimon did to me it‚Äôs poor work.
</p>
<p>
Im really sorry for you.
</p>
<p>
I tried to sue Bensimon but to go against those people is really hard financially and mentally so I wish you good luck. I know I‚Äôm about to just give up because I‚Äôm loosing everything and they end up suing you for defamation and crap like that. So unless you have more money than them it‚Äôs hard and depressing.
</p>
<p>
You can also contact the board of doctors for deontology and see if there is something there. I know they accepted my case and found that there was enough element to start an investigation on him( Bensimon).
</p>
<p>
If you want to vent or cry or whatever.feel free to reach. I know how it can be hard when you are expecting so much.
</p>
<p>
We just have to stand together and keep posting and keep them accountable.

While it does make you look a bit older id say you look much more feminine now and you do look very pretty

In which part of your face do you have nerve damage? Chin and lips I&#39;m willing to bet.

Do you think it is appropriate to ask this given the amount of criticism we have seen in this sub and others?

I like the forehead and nose. Isn&#39;t this the guy from 2pass clinic or something? I&#39;ve read terrible opinions about him. There should be like a list of dangerous surgeons we should avoid.  I&#39;m so sad for you.
