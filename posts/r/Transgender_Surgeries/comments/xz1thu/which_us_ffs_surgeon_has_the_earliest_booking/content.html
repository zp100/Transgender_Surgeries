I need FFS. I desperately want it ideally end of 2023 if not early 2024.
</p>
<p>
I love Dr. Harrison Lee’s results and he’d by my first choice with Deschamps-Braly close behind and Keojampa. I’m planning on not only draining my savings but getting a loan from a bank and my parents I don’t care whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
But I’m wondering if y’all know who is booking the earliest right now. I cannot wait any longer than 2024 to get this done. I wanna start living my life and don’t feel like I can until FFS.
</p>
<p>
Any help or knowledge please!

Dechamps-Braly and Keojampa have (to my knowledge) been booking out for a long time and to tell you the truth, there is a small chance you will be able to get them until 2025; 2024 if you are lucky, for sure you won’t be able to get them 2023.   I can’t speak for Harrison Lee as I don’t know anything about his waiting list but I’d imagine it’s way shorter of a wait time compared to the other two.
</p>
<p>
The one I know for sure that booking pretty early and reasonable is Jumaily. I was able to wait for 2.5 months for a consult and book surgery about 4 months out from consult in his California location. He’s top tier right now, but I understand if you prefer Harrison Lee.

There was a little list of everything but basically it was forehead, brows, nose, lips and chin. It took a couple months for the consultation date and the consultation it&#39;s self cost a couple hundred. Like many people it&#39;s the price I will struggle with, it works out to something like 80k Canadian and that&#39;s a lot even for me and I have a great paying job here.
</p>
<p>
So now I am waiting for a CT scan that they would like before moving onto next steps but here that might take a while (thinking about just paying out of pocket for that one). He was booking something like 6 months in advance right now.
</p>
<p>
If it&#39;s just a doctor that has a short list right now that you want transop in Mexico just told me their list is only 45 days. So they could get you started a little faster if you wanna travel.
</p>
<p>
My advise is to not rush though, find some doctors who&#39;s results you think you like and reach out to them.

He’s soooo expensive but damn his results are amazing. And that’s not a horrible wait time either! All in all less than year or so. That fits perfectly with my goal.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the info it’s really helpful.
</p>
<p>
And yeah! I’ve looked into Transop/Dr. Cardenas I used his quote builder and everything I want plus 11 day accommodations is $20,000 which I can afford now. But I haven’t seen a ton of before and afters and the ones I’ve seen I wasn’t thrilled with. He has great reviews but it’s my face so I kind of want the best even it means debt lol and part of me is so scared that he’s a fraction of the cost of other doctors

Different countries have different &#34;costs of living.&#34; So don&#39;t go off of that alone. It&#39;s just &#34;cheaper&#34; to live in MX, so surgery costs will be correspondingly lower too. But surgeon
<em>
skill
</em>
can be on par.
</p>
<p>
I always think of Turkey as an example. It&#39;s like rhinoplasty capital. Same for hair transplants. And building its rep for leg lengthening too.
</p>
<p>
Also, there&#39;s
<em>
more
</em>
than just Cardenas in MX.
</p>
<p>
(It&#39;s still all gonna cost you ~20,000 USD.)

Jesus!!! Roughly $60,000?! I expected $40-50. Wow

How long did you wait until you got your consultation? And what surgery time did he offer?

Waiting a few extra months for a face you’ll be stuck with the rest of your life is worth it. The number one thing I’ve seen in my years in the community, in my own life, and even on here is people rushing and using inexperienced surgeons who are cheaper or who can get them in faster and then regretting it or needing costly repair work and additional surgery later. If you have the money or insurance, go to the best surgeon who will give you the best results, not whoever can fit you in next Tuesday. There’s a reason their schedule is free. Trust me, in three years when you’re looking in the mirror the extra six months or year you waited for the excellent surgeon won’t matter, but you’ll be regretting it every day if you rush and get less than good results from “whoever can fit me in soonest.”

This is a great point and you’re right!
</p>
<p>
I’m just scared to wait 2 years because I won’t feel like I can live my life until then, but I don’t want to be stuck with something that makes me more unhappy than the before.
</p>
<p>
Definitely gonna stick to the top 3 I mentioned in my post + Jumaily and just hope one of them has an ideal timeline because I trust all 4 of their results.

I know two years sounds like a while, but imagine having to wait that long with substandard results to get to see one of them to see IF they can fix it. And that’s a big “if.” Now, not every “unknown” doctor is bad. There are some lesser known surgeons that do great work and who have shorter waiting lists who would probably give excellent results. But it’s very hit or miss, and you’d be much better off going with one of the “big names” who’s work you’re familiar with and who we know turns out consistently good work. Any plastic surgeon with craniofacial experience can do forehead shaves and call themselves an “FFS surgeon,” but only a very few actually manage to really excel and have the artistic eye to really pull it off.

I agree with everyone here on not rushing, for all the reasons stated. But that said, the waiting lists have become extremely long for most of the top US surgeons; demand is outstripping supply. US FFS insurance coverage improving over the past few years is probably a major reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to Facial Team (in Spain, so expect little to no insurance help) so that’s my admitted bias. I know you asked for US only, but if you’re planning to go out of pocket there’s no reason to discount other countries; although Facial Team is expensive, they’re still cheaper than most US surgeons. Facial Team can be an excellent choice if you still want to look like “you”, but more feminine. If you’re looking for more radical changes, you might want someone like DB. Facial Team being multiple surgeons means they handle many more patients per week, and accordingly have a much shorter waitlist. I personally want more subtle results, and was unwilling to wait the 2+ years that now seems fairly standard in the US.

I’m pretty happy with my face now and can pass
<em>
okay
</em>
in certain angles and with makeup. I used to be misgendered as a girl when I identified as a guy. But even with that I have a very sharp jawline and a wider chin and a bigger nose as well as a very pronounced Adam’s apple. So, I’m not looking for aggressive changes, definitely want natural but I’m also not paying $50K+ to look the exact same.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask your quote from Facial Team? Their work looks good I haven’t seen any afters that looked bad they actually all look beautiful I just wasn’t as impressed as the surgeons mentioned/ it isn’t the look I personally am going for.
</p>
<p>
But truly cost and time are a big factor for me. So as long as I’m not sacrificing quality I just wanna get this done as soon as I can while still getting the best

Something like €30k not including forehead. The USD now being above the Euro helps a bit.
</p>
<p>
Facial Team optimizes for safety and natural results, and tends to discourage procedures if they think the benefit will be marginal. They also don’t by default do any soft-tissue work. So, their complication rates are very low, but sometimes their results don’t seem “aggressive” enough. Note they have tons of really helpful videos on YouTube, about Facial Team but also FFS in general, and their consults are free.
</p>
<p>
“The best” will mean something different for everyone. I want to still look like “me”, only more feminine, and I value safety, aftercare and communication very highly, all of which FT is known for. And their waitlist is shorter, since they’re a team of surgeons instead of one. For me, Facial Team is probably “the best” choice. But for someone optimizing for the most dramatic results, maybe DB is their “best” choice.

Dr.DB does not have a team of surgeons. He has a team of mostly unfriendly staff.
</p>
<p>
No doctor is perfect or has a perfect track record so you should consider why he has no bad reviews - maybe he has even better lawyers

You are living the result with the rest of your life. DB’s has Long list, but he always get chances to bump up, I got bump up almost a year earlier. Book a date and pay the deposit for the consolation and surgery date first!

I would not recommend Dr. Kuperstock! I know a couple of people who are really disappointed with his work, way too subtle, barely looked operated on, especially one girl in my group tried to take her own life because Kuperstock performed a type 1 instead type 3 like they agreed upon THE MOMENT SHE WAS OPERATED ON and was left with a big scar! Like who does that to someone?! I used a surgeon similar to her and he did the same thing to me, (I won’t name the surgeon cause I’d be outed).

It wasn&#39;t my forehead, but Sidhbh Gallagher did that to me. I ask myself the very same question.

wow, surprised to read this considering how good my experience was. i had a type 3 with him and i&#39;m very happy with the work done. how was it known that a type 3 was needed? what was the problem with the scar?

I’m not going to share the full experience because that is her story to tell. All I can say is according to her; Kuperstock looked at her scan that she gave him and confirmed that a type 3 was needed. They confirmed it again before entering the operating room but afterwards it was discovered that she had a type 1 instead of a type 3 because her forehead wasn’t set back far enough, he left her nose crooked and his stitch work left her with a big forehead scar because he put too much tension on the scar. He’s seems like a nice guy but not as skilled as he makes himself out to be. I can confirm that one other poster on here can agree that his work is not great in general but I hope he’s improved his work since last year.

in May, I called Lee&#39;s office to book a consult and the soonest available was in late December. yesterday they called and offered to move me to next Monday because of a cancellation. the patient coordinator also told me they had one surgery date available on January 31, otherwise they are currently scheduling for March 2023.
