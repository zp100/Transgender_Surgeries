I’m trying to narrow down my options for hip procedures and in concept this approach has pretty much my full attention. My concerns are that it’s super new and there’s virtually nothing out there on post-op results/experience by patients. On paper it sounds great but to get any sort of first-hand account from anyone who’s had this or even just met with a surgeon or two would be invaluable.
</p>
<p>
I know that beyond Osty Meditech in Korea (titanium implants; questionable clinic), Dr. Eppley in the US has designed an implant and
<a href="https://exploreplasticsurgery.com/iliac-crest-implants-for-aesthetic-widening-of-the-bony-hips/">discusses the procedure on his blog</a>
. Any other info, resources or experiences are incredibly welcome.

I was on the osteo med implant contact list for a while, they emailed me at the end of 2019 and said they were starting in early 2020. The cost was $60,000 USD and there is a wait list for the procedure. I&#39;m pretty skeptical about it&#39;s effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t heard anything since and can&#39;t imagine it went forward with Corona.
</p>
<p>
As for silicone implants there are a few reviews of them on realself.com, but they seem pretty mixed. Hip fat transfers also don&#39;t survive super well unless you already have a fair amount of fat there due to blood supply being necessary to keep the fat alive.

I was in contact with Osty as well. Still am I guess. Funny, they quoted me $50k and offered to cut it by “20-30% if the clinic is allowed to use your photos for marketing purposes.” Considering the pioneering surgeon stated the cost of the procedure at ~$17k back in 2017/18 I was pretty put off and told them as much.
</p>
<p>
Also last I checked (~June 30th) their website [Osty Meditech](ostymeditech.com) now makes almost no mention of the procedure, seemingly having shifted toward selling the implant itself.

Interesting. Honestly the whole thing seemed to be a bit sketchy for me. Also I feel like the main problem with hips is not having enough down by the actual hip joint rather than the top of the pelvis which that implant seems to target

Yeah, I completely agree. We would need some type of procedure that would extend the length of the femoral neck would probably be a little more beneficial, maybe these two in conjunction.
</p>
<p>
Then you&#39;d mess up your q angle and potentially now your knees would be all out of alignment. Honestly the whole system of joints is designed for proper movement, stars adjusting one without the others, and I can only imagine you might cause some serious problems.

I would 100% find more natural ways to do this before going the surgery rout. It might be harder, but it would probably be cheaper. And way less risky and have less chance of backfiring if it’s so bard to find anyone who even does it. I’d hate to go ‘I’ll be a pioneer’ have it go horribly wrong and something horrifying happen.

Hey people! Just thought I’d pop back here and share some crazy and hopefully encouraging feedback. Following this thread I stuck to my word and started workin out the booty pretty religiously. My first couple weeks I was legitimately doing as little as 6-8 minutes per day, 4-5 days per week. As I progressed I notched it up bit by bit first to 8-10 mins and as of now around 12 minutes of high-intensity intervals every morning, reliably 6 days/week.
</p>
<p>
Before I started I measured my lower hips and was 80cm which had me looking uncomfortably straight and squareish. 3 weeks ago (less than 2 months since starting this little self-challenge) I had professional measurements taken by a seamstress (for clothes; no bias) and those same lower hips are now a full, hourglass-projecting 90cm!! I gained 10cm = ~2in/side in 6 weeks. It sounds crazy but I swear it’s true.
</p>
<p>
I did up my protein intake a lot because in order to build mass you need to be in a protein-rich calorie surplus, and my exercises were very targeted for side-booty building (YouTube, etc.). I’d been noticing the results for a good little while even before the measurements validated them, and I’m amazed that I’ve been able to build myself this way after feeling kinda hopeless and desperate for awhile.
</p>
<p>
So I just wanted to share and offer some encouragement to anyone who may need it. You may decide surgery is the only option for you and that’s totally ok, but you can also probably get very close to your ideal body shape by yourself at home with some ankle weights and resistance bands. ♥️♥️

BBL has high risks associated with it. It’s one of the most dangerous possible liposculpture procedures.
</p>
<p>
Oh and results aren’t exactly permanent, you could revert a little or a lot right after the procedure, especially if you weight cycle at all after wards or fail to follow recovery advice.
</p>
<p>
For me personally, I am intrigued by implants to get a little bit of hip flare.

BBL requires fat, a lot of which (30%+) is likely to be absorbed back into the body (not contribute to body shape). I couldn’t do it if I wanted to, and then there are the substantial risks that have emerged recently.

Note that this is a new surgery and the example we see is just a single set of pictures, I would like to see dozens of examples before making a final decision.

Hundreds. Thousands. Dozens isn’t enough at all. Dozens could easily be cherry picked from hundreds+ that went horribly.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Now, ultimately the only place I would probably go for this WOULD be SKorea, but they’re also 100% better plastic surgeons and it’s generally more cost effective depending on what you’re getting and the heal time is better. But, this would have to be something WAY more done before I’d ever encourage someone to get it.

I said dozens because this is new surgery and many don&#39;t want to wait until we see hundreds of examples. Someone has to be in one of the pictures we see as examples and luckily this isn&#39;t permanent, it is an implant that could be removed and redone if a better version comes along.

There’s some serious complaints about surgeons in Korea and it’s quite difficult to research it properly.

I don&#39;t plan of doing this yet... someday perhaps. I don&#39;t plan on going to South Korea, I really dislike traveling so I&#39;ll keep my planned surgeries in the USA unless something compelling prompts me to alter my plans. Complaints about surgeons are universal because after all surgeries are done by people and we all know people aren&#39;t perfect but we expect more from surgeons and we should because of what they are doing especially when it comes to this specialty.

I&#39;d definitely want to see more examples, especially considering I&#39;m not impressed at all with these results. That looks unnatural and weird af to me. It doesn&#39;t have a curve to it like a normal hip and almost looks square. I have some dysphoria around my hip size too. But not enough to pay 50k for that poor of a result. And that&#39;s the one they felt was good enough to post... what about the others?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very very skeptical. Honestly, after a long time on HRT. My hips are already the widest part of my frame unless you measure all the way around the outside of my shoulders anyway. You can dramatically increase the size of your side-butt and make the shape of your booty better with targeted exercise too. I&#39;m doing it now and it&#39;s made a noticeable difference. Current measurements are 36-27-39. I&#39;m 5&#39;9 so it&#39;s not a super dramatic hourglass shape, but I&#39;m mostly ok about it. I wish my boobs were a little bigger more than anything else. Also, if you look at research most women describe their body type as &#34;straight&#34; or &#34;banana.&#34; Or the bottom heavy &#34;pear&#34; shape. Only something like 10% of women have a dramatic hourglass shape naturally.

I would like to see more examples as well. I also have a lot of dysphoria about my shape and measurements and I’m about 38|39-28|29-41 and about 5&#39;10-11&#34; (this still may have changed, and I still have a little weight around my midsection; I’m around a 36C). I found that my measurements give me some kind of hourglass shape, and a W:H ratio in the.7 range, and I am nonetheless self conscious. I have been trying to transition in various ways for a while, and may have some other medical conditions that gave me these results, though I really try to hold onto hope for further improvement. I am still rather skeptical about a lot of things.
</p>
<p>
I have only seen some limited information on all of this, though I would personally be willing to go through quite a lot to improve my condition, including but not limited to fracturing and breaking bones if need be (I have heard about procedures where this happens). I have sometimes felt like I could be willing to break apart if I could just be put back together as feminine as possible. I feel I made mistakes, especially with how I dieted and had eating problems, so hip procedures would be nice. While it may not be the end of the world, I still feel like things could be better.

Right on girl. I’d started a side-booty workout and laziness got the better of me. Here’s my new plan: keep working it a little bit each day 5-7 days/week while I navigate this surgery maze and hopefully by the time I find the ideal procedure and a great surgeon to do it I don’t need it ;)

Good plan! Squats, clams (with a heavy resistance band), lunges, side lunges, side leg lifts, sumos, prisoner squats, wall sits, monster walks. You can also go out and run uphill/stairs, which is killer cardio and is good for your legs too.
</p>
<p>
Vary it a little from day to day so your body doesn&#39;t get used to it. But it really works!

You&#39;re welcome! It really helps with my depression to keep up with exercise too. Dysphoria is a mother fucker so we need all the help we can get, right?
</p>
<p>
If you feel up to it, I highly recommend kettlebells too. Kettlebell swings work your butt and legs and core all at once. :-)

I always feel amazing when I’m working out but it seems like there’s always one day when I overdo it and then I start to dread it forever until I derail and stop. But you’re so right and I just need to keep it to a manageable short but frequent regimen until it feels natural to go longer. Starting up again today.

I&#39;ve been aware of the hip-to-waist ratio for decades, I remember reading about the first facial feminization surgery back in the late 90&#39;s (Done by Dr. Douglas Ousterhout) when I first got on the internet and that prompted me to research all aspects of the differences between male and female bodies. I soon realized that a wider pelvis was more attractive than bigger breasts to my eye. I&#39;ve seen women with narrow hips/big breasts and women with wider hips and small breasts and I prefer the wider/smaller look, although a perfect combo of wide pelvis/natural c-cup is what I actually prefer but they are unicorns - rare :) The example on the website was disappointing but like I wrote earlier, this is a new surgery and I think we will see more examples and I do think that some additional fat grafting might be helpful for the upper thigh area to give that look we all like. Also, the techniques will probably improve over time as some patients aren&#39;t happy with the results and they will modify the procedure to have a better outcome. Don&#39;t look at this as the only result, the first breasts implants were probably not so good either but over a period of time surgeons improve and let&#39;s hope this pelvic plasty improves over time.

Sure. I know it&#39;s not the only result. But, I&#39;m saying I&#39;d need a lot more evidence and some more positive outcomes to consider this myself. Surgeons also usually select their BEST results for their websites, so that means that most of the women who undergo this procedure probably look like this or worse. To my eye the woman in the pic looks better in her pre-op picture. It&#39;s about what looks natural for your body type. Large hip/waist ratios look great when they&#39;re natural, and they&#39;re more &#34;classically&#34; feminine, but not even all cis women have them and I think we need to stop perpetuating the myth that they do.
</p>
<p>
As someone commented above, it&#39;s more work, but achievable to get wider and more natural looking hips via exercise. Also far less expensive and more natural looking. Just like with VFS, I think I want to see how far they get in the next 5-10 years before I&#39;d take the risk.

I&#39;m in total agreement, at one time VFS wasn&#39;t recommended but now it is routine. I don&#39;t think it will take 5-10 years though. I think it will happen sooner because we aren&#39;t the only possible patients, many women never develop a wider pelvis but have narrow boyish hips and many have tried different options to make them appear wider, this surgery will help but again, all we have seen is a single example and I do agree we need to see many, many more before I would consider this surgery. I would do fat grafting before this and if you didn&#39;t know that at one time fat grafting was actually considered dangerous until they figured it out. Time will tell.

Not really. I think most surgeons STILL have a less then stellar track record with it. But it&#39;s also probably the most complicated surgery out there for trans people. We can agree to disagree. But I&#39;ve been impressed with only a handful of results that I&#39;ve seen from the people who&#39;ve undergone it.

As far as I know Yesson was the first to get it right. I remember early examples of voice feminization surgery, some people lost their ability to speak normal.

Ah yes, these are the photos I’d seen recently. I lost track of the website and couldn’t find it again going to Osty Meditech (which I believe the chief surgeon of Yonsei Baro Chuk may also be the CEO of). Ya these are what actually made me back away from the Korean version of this procedure. Just my opinion but these results look kinda square and unnatural (albeit definitely wider!). Not worth $50k or being a guinea pig for. Thanks for this

That I do not know, I found this place by google search. I would contact the original creators of the implant for that information. Here is that info:

Dr. Barry Eppley in Indiana, USA is taking patients using his own implant (which imo looks superior to the titanium chunk marketed out of Korea), but has not yet performed it.
<a href="https://Eppleyplasticsurgery.com" rel="nofollow">You can read some of his thoughts on it or schedule a consult on his website</a>

One way to look wonky for sure. Not necessarily supposed to be the wide part your hip joint attaching to your leg would still be pretty narrow which is really where the width is needed.

I have been in contact with them too. and they told me $50,000. and they&#39;d take money off if they could use the photos. What&#39;s the deal with this place? does anyone know anyone who has actually gotten the surgery?

Korea: $50k, possibly minus a 20-30% discount if you agree to let them use your photos.
</p>
<p>
Eppley in US: TBD but based on a loose email conversation about numerous surgeries in one operation, considerably less.
