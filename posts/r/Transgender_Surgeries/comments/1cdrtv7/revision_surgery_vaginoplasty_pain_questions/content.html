I am 19.5 weeks post op and am having a revision surgery in a month for width/depth, unburying the clitoris, and connecting the labia to the introitus. My labia are completely numb and I am still unable to orgasm. I had PIV surgery and am having a skin graft revision.  How similar to the first surgery will the revision pain and recovery? People who have had surgery and then depth and width revisions how bad was your recovery process? Was there post surgery depression that’s commonly part of the first surgeries recovery? I’d love to hear people’s recovery stories and how that went for them.

tbh - it sounds a bit early to be doing a revision for anything other than serious complications.  You are still healing, and numbness and inability to orgasm really aren&#39;t all that uncommon this early on.  I was 10 *months* post-op before I managed to orgasm, and it still takes a bit of effort (though better each time).

I would imagine that having a revision using skin grafts will be more painful to recover from than other revision options - particularly those which are only addressing aesthetics - so that is going to be a factor depending on where the grafts come from.   I am having a revision in October (Clitoroplasty, Labiaplasty, Introitoplasty/perineoplasty - and possible urethroplasty, depending how much needs to be done in that area - all mostly for aesthetics and some minor functional things) but that is a full 15.5 months after my original surgery.  My revision will be outpatient, and the expectation is that recovery will be vastly simpler compared to the original since there isn&#39;t a lot of internal work going on.  I expect that sitting will once again be uncomfortable for a week or two, but I am not anticipating it having a significant impact on my day to day function.

My depth and width were a complete failure. They gave me 15.5 cm during surgery and when they took out the packing I had 7 cm. My revision is with Dr remineni and they are confident it’s been enough time. It’ll have been 5.5 months since my first surgery. I think having my clitoris buried under numb skin makes orgasming impossible and I don’t really have a vaginal canal anymore. Width is incredibly narrow.

What’s weird is my surgeon keeps saying it’s weird I am numb and she doesn’t know why I am numb. She tells me it’s A-typical for me to still be as numb as I am. It’s a weird situation when I think being numb is normal but my surgeon doesn’t act that way.
