I had an Orchiectomy on January 9th. Swelling and bruising was a lot and very concerning. I had to wear pads/gauze for a couple weeks. I got a hematoma on one side that swelled up pretty big until it finally leaks out of a small opening in my stitches, mostly because I noticed it was already leaking there so I applied a bit of pressure and it just started flowing (gross I know).
</p>
<p>
But since then the swelling really went down, no more bruising, and no more spotting at all. I‚Äôm still waiting for all swelling to go away and for the cords to fully retract. Right now it feels like they are attached to something in the scrotum and that has me a little concerned. But I‚Äôm finally able to tuck a bit again, although I don‚Äôt feel I can wear any jeans and have only been wearing dresses since.
</p>
<p>
Congrats on feeling right! It‚Äôs an amazing feeling to finally have them gone either way

I tried going back to work after 5 days. Got through the day but had to ask my boss for some additional time because it was still quite painful. He even told me that I looked like shit and in a lot of pain lol. If you can do it I would definitely suggest working remotely. I did end up getting a jock strap which alleviated a lot of the pain I was having.

Im wearing my usual bikinis with a pad, and yoga pants. That seems to be enough.  Maybe something more would be less painful though. However its really not bad now so I think a few more days will really be good.

They&#39;re supposed to in the end. Once all swelling goes down and the stitches inside heal, they should retract up into the inguinal canal if severed high enough. This is what my urologist told me

Aahhh. This I didnt know!  I&#39;m pretty sure they cut them very high.  I certainly cant/dont feel them in the scrotal area at all. Guessing the hard bits I feel up higher are the severed ends maybe.  Oh well - either way they are gone and thats the most important thing.  üòÅüòãü•∞ü•≥

I‚Äôm a trans girl (23) who just had her orchiectomy two days ago. So far I have no swelling, bruising, or blood. Just tired &amp; weak is all. My surgeon said it was a highly successful operation. My only question is this...So it looks like both balls are still there even though they‚Äôre not since it was bilateral orchiectomy. It is normal for the skin to look thick when there‚Äôs no swelling?

Yes that is normal, and I think you actually are seeing swelling because of that!  Mine was same and I kept thinking did they leave one?  Today, day 9, that has massively subsided and its clear they didnt leace any. Give it a few days, you&#39;ll see that shrink away.
</p>
<p>
I wasnt ever weak myself - just very much in pain and only due to the swelling really.  You could see it just below my abdomen!  Weaing underwear was eve painful, not because of the surgery site, but because of the waist band itself pushing against so close to the swelled area.
</p>
<p>
Isnt it great though to have woken up and just knew they were finally gone!
</p>
<p>
Congrats!

Give it a bit yet - some of my pain didnt start right away. About day 3/4 I felt a different pain (the getting kicked in the nuts feeling went away by then and the new pain, felt like achy swollen muscles, showed up. Thats when the swelling became the worst. Just dont let it worry you if it shows up. I think its perfectly normal to have it at this point. Also, even though you dont feel pain you need to seriously take it easy!  No pain doesnt mean anything I think- you still got things cut up down there and therefor will have scar tissue - the more you agitate that the harder it is to heal. So stay put and take it very easy, and pay much attention to your weight restrictions!

I totally agree with you, no pain doesn‚Äôt mean all is perfect. Surgery is surgery &amp; especially in a sensitive area. I‚Äôve been resting, drinking lots of water &amp; pain pills. Might move to ice since from you I know it‚Äôs swelling. It helps talking to someone who had it done. I appreciate itüòä

No problem!  I used ice alot but not on the surgery site :)  that whole area, even with its swelling, seemed comfortable.  I kept the ice on that upper area....even tried heat and that was nice too. Hadnt had the need to use any ice in a few days now though ü§£

Yes, this was my first as well - but it was also to address a chronic pain too. So two birds - one stone!  I really want to do just one more but I&#39;m working that out with the wife now.

I think it‚Äôs smart to start a gender transition journey with an orchiectomy. It‚Äôs simple, outpatient, cheap, with lots of benefits. I‚Äôm non op grs/srs. But still have goals for my transition. Good luck working out your goals with your wife. My new girlfriend is also trans like me &amp; we both support each other &amp; give advice

Thats good to hear. I fear losing my wife over this and deciding what is more important is very difficult right now. However, there are reasons she might just be fine in the end, so, together, we are working theough this to find how we can both stay happy.
