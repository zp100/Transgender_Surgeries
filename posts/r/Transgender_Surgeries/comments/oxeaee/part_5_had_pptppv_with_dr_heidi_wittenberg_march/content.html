Almost all the dark spots from laser treatment have cleared up, leaving the skin lighter than before treatment.  I see a patch that&#39;s now slightly lighter than the skin around it but that should even out in time.  Comparing it to the 7-20 image just before treatment, I think the skin looks a lot less like scrotal tissue now.  I think it&#39;s also a bit swollen/saggy from two hours of sitting/driving just before I took the photo.
</p>
<p>
Between 3 and 6 days ago I kept finding shed hairs from the laser treatment stuck to my dilator and then they stopped shedding.  There are still a few that are stuck or clinging to life but I&#39;m pretty happy with the results.
</p>
<p>
I marked my purple dilator with a white paint marker a few days ago and it seems to be staying marked through the washes and getting lube on the mark during washing.  Here&#39;s two photos aligned side to side from the same dilation session two days ago:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/flxmie0yp7f71.png?width=1894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830ebb870ab5ad76cf8ea89aa18d55c34991129e">https://preview.redd.it/flxmie0yp7f71.png?width=1894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830ebb870ab5ad76cf8ea89aa18d55c34991129e
</a>
</p>
<p>
I drew a white line on the photo of the orange dilator where the line of the purple dilator corresponds to on the orange.  Both photos are taken by resting the bottom of my phone in my belly button and tilting forward till the dilator is centered in the screen so both photos are pretty close to identical distance and angle.  So the purple still isn&#39;t getting quite as deep as orange but it feels like it&#39;s hitting full depth.  Still, based on the photo I guess it isn&#39;t quite full depth so I&#39;ll keep trying.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gone any deeper in the last 5 days at least.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I&#39;ve been a bit more swollen than usual the last week and pain has been marginally worse.  It might be because I started wearing tighter panties.  They can definitely pull things more painfully if I don&#39;t keep shifting them just right.  The body still seems to randomly pick whether things will hurt to touch or move or not hurt at all.  I&#39;ve definitely found if I don&#39;t wear panties, it dries out within 20 or so minutes and then hurts consistently when I move.  Even if I cover with a sheet it still dries out, so that&#39;s annoying.
</p>
<p>
I noticed if I sit farther forward on the toilet seat and put my knees closer together, I pee straight down more consistently (but still not completely consistently).  Of course sitting like that hurts a bit so, *sigh*.
</p>
<p>
I skipped morning dilation twice the last week and after the first skip I didn&#39;t notice evening dilation was any more difficult.  The second skip things felt a little tighter getting in the last inch and the purple caused more soreness than usual.  But I&#39;m working towards gradually reducing to once per day dilation.
</p>
<p>
Someone mentioned their doctor said not to rotate the dilators once inserted because of the bend in them, but I&#39;ve been rotating 360 degrees since day 1 to evenly spread the lubricant.  I also feel the bend in the dilator is going to stretch and pull things as you insert it even if you don&#39;t rotate it.  Anyone have an opinion?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m going to reduce my updates to once every 2-3 weeks on Tues because I don&#39;t expect any significant changes each week.  If there&#39;s anything significant, I&#39;ll post again next week.

I finally sent this to Mozaiccare:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Starting at 14 weeks postop I&#39;ve found something that looks like snot between my kitty lips when I go to dilate, or sometimes it appears on the dilator after dilation.  Sometimes it disappears for 2 or more weeks and then I find it again.  Location varies and color/density vary a little. I think it sometimes appears on my dilator in amounts so small I don&#39;t notice it.  Do you know what causes it or where it comes from?  As far as I know, nothing can secrete mucus except the urethra.
</p>

<p>
I got this reply:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is completely normal after having a peritoneal-pull through vaginoplasty. As we counseled you before surgery and again at your 3 month follow up visit, the peritoneal lining does produce a natural lubrication / discharge. This can be lifelong but in most cases is not harmful to you. If the consistency changes and becomes more &#34;cottage cheese like&#34; or you notice a foul odor, you may want to douche more frequently or be tested for an infection.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So I&#39;m happy they think it&#39;s nothing to worry about but I really don&#39;t think the snot is peritoneal discharge.  Peritoneal skin allows fluids from between cells to seep through and those fluids are called transudate, but they don&#39;t have a mucus-like consistency.  The only type of skin that I can find that produces mucus is the cervix (which I don&#39;t have) and the urethra, so I still think the snot most likely comes from urethral skin and that means you could get it with a penile inversion as well.  If this only happens with peritoneal pull-through procedures then I guess I&#39;m wrong.  Either way, it doesn&#39;t appear very often or bother me.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I noticed in my research notes that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axSCOnkv7Cg">this Youtube vid
</a>
says &#34;Sometimes you see stringy yellowish material which is surface bits of flesh that die off.&#34;  I&#39;m wondering if this could be the snotty stuff since it&#39;s sort of yellowish?
</p>
<p>
A couple days ago I switched from KY Jelly to ID Glide lube for dilation.  Now that I&#39;m not as tight as during the first couple months, the thinner lube seems about equivalent in effectiveness but is much easier to wash off the dilators and in the shower.  I put thin lines of it on three sides of the dilator, then spread it roughly evenly with a finger (though I suspect that isn&#39;t really necessary anymore).
</p>
<p>
Switched back to looser, more silky panties and realized they are waaaay more comfortable since my groin is still sensitive to being tugged.  I&#39;ve also been putting scar cream over the entire labia once per day hoping it might make the skin more elastic and healthy.  Hard to tell if it helps that but I think rubbing the scars is slowly making them softer and less painful.  I&#39;ve read rubbing scars helps them heal better once they&#39;ve healed enough on their own.  Right scar is usually pain free at this point but the left one still bugs me when touched.  Sometimes touching the labia is also mildly painful, more often on the left.  My SO still can&#39;t touch me down there without me going &#34;oww&#34; at random points and that&#39;s starting to really frustrate me.  How long until the pain finally goes away?
</p>
<p>
Skipping morning dilation every other day is working pretty well but I often notice things are tighter on days I skip (but occasionally it doesn&#39;t seem tighter).  Minor soreness during entry or about 1/3 in has been more noticeable the last week or so but it comes and goes.
</p>
<p>
I got back into Beat Saber (a VR game) a couple days ago and was happy to find it doesn&#39;t hurt my loins or tire me.  I was surprised at that because going up stairs still tires me quickly.  Hopefully VR games can get me back into some semblance of shape.  I&#39;m also back on the keto diet after my weight started going up much quicker the last couple weeks.

I thought I&#39;d show two angles on the clit this time so you can better see how the entire internal structure is healing.  The white parts around the vaginal canal entrance seem to have disappeared, leaving only some darker red patches.  I continue to use the steroid cream down there but have stopped using it above the clit since all the red there seems to be gone.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I tried starting with the purple dilator.  It hurt more going in than when I start with orange and it took longer to reach full depth but I got there after 5-10 mins.  I left it in extra long, 30-40 mins, then tried the blue dilator for the first time.  The first time I tried purple, it only went in an inch or two.  Blue felt like it wasn&#39;t going to go in much either, but I applied gentle pressure and played a game (Baba is You) with my other hand.  I was absorbed in the game and about 25 mins later I was surprised to find it had gone in almost to the last dot!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/zt3to1pya0i71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d10c4803a35288b8a22ad4ec58f4522a1f141c7b">https://preview.redd.it/zt3to1pya0i71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d10c4803a35288b8a22ad4ec58f4522a1f141c7b
</a>
</p>
<p>
The next day I actually did reach the last dot.  Blue makes me significantly sore, though.  I think a lot of the soreness comes from where it presses against the pelvic bone (maybe around the first or second dot).  I&#39;m wondering if it would help to also push the end of it away from the camera to reduce pressure on that area.
</p>
<p>
I discovered Bathmate appears to no longer be making the Hydrorocket douche, so if you want one, get them before they disappear.  See my edit in

<p>
Someone asked me in chat if I&#39;ve had any problems with over-lubrication or vaginal discharge, so let me talk about that a bit.  The short answer is no problem at all and what info I could find in research papers suggests the odds are low of it being a problem for anyone.
</p>
<p>
For me, friction or pressure of inserting something seems to produce enough lubrication to keep that something slick, but it still needs a coat of lube before insertion.  I&#39;m wearing panties without liners and not noticing any significant stains or soaking even wearing the same pair a few days in a row.  All panties have an extra liner sewn in at a strategic place to catch moisture because cis vaginas tend to not be dry.  I lived with a cis-female for 11+ years who had faded spots on all her darker panties because her discharge is acidic.  Girls are naturally wet but not likely enough to truly need anything beyond what a panty has built in.  What that liner absorbs tends to disperse and evaporate, and it would take quite an overproduction of fluid combined with tight pants to ever soak through the pants and show any evidence to the world.  If you&#39;re wearing a skirt, it&#39;s even less likely to be a problem.  If anything, I find that when I
<em>
don&#39;t
</em>
wear panties I get too dry so the skin sticks together and tugs parts that can still hurt when tugged.
</p>
<p>
That said, overlubrication was one of my concerns before the procedure but as far as I could find, it&#39;s rare for discharge to be a problem. I read about 10 research papers covering up to 182 patients and none mentioned over-lubrication being a problem.  One paper ( McQuillan SK, Grover SR.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531406">Systematic review of sexual function and satisfaction following the management of vaginal agenesis.
</a>
Int Urogynecol J. 2014 Oct;25(10):1313-20 ) is a retrospective study of 6,691 other papers and they found 3 in 500 recipients of the Davydov procedure (aka peritoneal pull-through vaginoplasty) complained about vaginal discharge as a long-term complication.  That&#39;s 0.6% and far lower than 71 out of 945 (7.5%) recipients of vaginoplasty using a segment of the bowel who complain about discharge.  It&#39;s important to realize that although 6,691 studies were included in the statistics, we don&#39;t know how many of them asked patients if discharge was a problem or included that information in their paper.  Still, I would think if it were a major problem, it would have likely been reported and included in more papers.
</p>
<p>
When I spoke to Dr. Wittenberg in late 2019, she had done 12 PPTV procedures and none of them reported problems with discharge after 3 months.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m told that she&#39;s no longer saying how many PPTV patients she&#39;s had or how many report problems with discharge.  Her official stance is that you might need panty liners for the rest of your life and she doesn&#39;t feel there is enough data to predict what the odds are of that possibility.  To me, this feels like a way to remove herself from legal responsibility maybe after dealing with a litigious patient, but I find it to be quite frustrating for people trying to make an informed decision.
</p>
<p>
So, I still think odds of needing liners is quite low but I also believe that in the worst case, needing liners isn&#39;t much of a burden. Something like Always Ultrathin can soak a lot of fluid and is about 1/16&#34; thick and not likely to be often felt once you&#39;re healed.  While Kotex &#39;barely there&#39; liners are about 4 sheets of paper thick and hard to feel even if you&#39;re trying to feel them, though they don&#39;t soak near as much.

8-24-21 update (24 weeks, 5.5 months post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Three days ago I had a bit of a scare.  It was the first time I&#39;ve seen blood on my dilator in at least two months and it was more blood than I&#39;ve ever seen:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/nr3d5t3f0ej71.png?width=2076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c07b90586158d09ef03638d0f6b348e274f142d6">https://preview.redd.it/nr3d5t3f0ej71.png?width=2076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c07b90586158d09ef03638d0f6b348e274f142d6
</a>
</p>
<p>
Once I pulled out the bloody purple dilator on the left, I took a bunch of photos trying to figure out where the blood was coming from.  My first thought was the dark spot above the clit but that turned out to be a glob of congealed blood.  I couldn&#39;t see blood in the vaginal canal in any of the pics and most of the blood is hanging out around the clit so I&#39;m expecting a source up there.  There&#39;s a dark spot below and to the right of the clit and that&#39;s my best guess as to the source.  The same dark spot shows up in a photo the next day, and it&#39;s still visible 8/24 but fading.  The really dark spot is gone in 8/24 and unfortunately I didn&#39;t think to stretch the skin like that to see the area clearly in previous images.  I suspect the really dark spot was another blob of congealed blood.
</p>
<p>
If that spot is what was bleeding, then I think I scraped it with my nail while I was masturbating.  It didn&#39;t hurt at the time and I didn&#39;t notice blood on my finger or on my vibrator, though it&#39;s possible I washed it off without seeing it.  It still seems very odd to me I didn&#39;t find blood at that point and only found it hours later when I dilated.  Maybe it was a slow bleed that had trouble stopping because of remaining wet.
</p>
<p>
Blargh!  But at least I haven&#39;t had blood during any other dilation.  Although blue went in surprisingly deep the first time, it&#39;s been very slow to get deeper.  Over the week it went from one dot visible to that dot barely being out of view in photos.  Soreness from removing it is still there but has improved significantly.  Soreness from removing purple has almost disappeared.
</p>
<p>
I have a bunch of pairs of Cacique &#34;cheeky&#34; panties in this one style I like and I realized that even when I wear the largest pair, they still ride up and tug my groin uncomfortably.  Seems to be something about the shape of them.  So I&#39;ve been trying other pairs but most are too tight around the thighs and so they pull in a different way.  I really only have 3-4 pairs I consider comfortable.  So the moral of the story is try lots of options while you heal.  Just being a size or two too large is not enough.
</p>
<p>
I remember seeing some people say they were back to 100% normal at six months but sadly I&#39;m still not quite there.  I&#39;m at the point where some nights I don&#39;t notice any pain when I first put my legs together, but sometimes I still feel the soreness at random times.  Rubbing the scars with lotion still hurts, but it&#39;s gradually improving.  Trying to squat with my knees together is still too painful without spreading my knees a little.  My tail bone also hurts significantly when I sit in certain positions or on certain types of chairs and that&#39;s probably because I still spend most of my time on my back at my computer.  I need to start transitioning to my recliner chair...
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I&#39;ve been stable at needing to get up to pee 1-2 times per night for at least a couple months.  This sucks but I was needing to do the same thing before surgery so it&#39;s just related to aging, not the surgery.  It&#39;s not near as bad as needing to pee every 1-2 hours as was the case some nights earlier in recovery.  I&#39;ve discovered if I walk to the bathroom with my eyes closed most of the time, opening only briefly to get my bearings, I get back to sleep much faster.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sleeping on my side 100% of the time now.  I either have a blanket between my knees or I have one knee in front of the other.  The later puts more compression on my groin but there&#39;s usually not much discomfort from that and it doesn&#39;t last.  If I sleep with a pillow between my legs then I still get the sensation of not having enough blood in my legs after a couple hours but I would guess the same was true before surgery (I don&#39;t remember trying to sleep with a pillow between legs back then).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I&#39;m getting quite frustrated with the lingering soreness when my groin is touched so I cleaned off my recliner chair and set up a second monitor, trackball, and keyboard to use my computer from there.  I was hoping that by sitting there and putting pressure on my groin, it might help it stop hurting more quickly (like when pain quickly diminished by walking with my legs together).  Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t feel like the recliner actually puts pressure on my groin (at least, it doesn&#39;t hurt) but it does hurt my tail bone so I&#39;ll have to ease myself into using it.
</p>
<p>
Five days ago I got friction burns on my inner thighs from walking for the first time since surgery.  I&#39;m confused as to why because I&#39;ve done more walking on other days, but it might be because I was walking faster than on previous outings because I wasn&#39;t feeling limited by groin pain.  I also wonder if pulling my panties down a bit on most previous occasions was putting a bit of a buffer in the area while this time I had them pulled up normally.  Either way, I was a little disturbed when I started dilating to find strips between my labia also got burned!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/ot0nlfgq8tk71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a9b4ed765324bdbc6f099ce9b28bbd7a7ba870">https://preview.redd.it/ot0nlfgq8tk71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0a9b4ed765324bdbc6f099ce9b28bbd7a7ba870
</a>
</p>
<p>
So that sucks...  At least the labia burns didn&#39;t hurt much but the thigh one was pretty stingy.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone talk about labia friction burns before but I may have to use talcum powder there as well as on my inner thighs (which I&#39;ve had to do for years).  This might also be a reason to not get rid of all the hair on the labia as it might help prevent this, but it&#39;s not enough to stop me from removing it.  I also wonder if pulling panties up might make the labia rub more, or maybe using lighter lubricants the last 3ish weeks instead of the more tenacious KY Jelly left things less lubricated.
</p>
<p>
In better news, I think the blue dilator is reaching max depth on some days, or quite close to it.  But it still causes a fair amount of soreness so I think it will be a couple weeks or more before I can start with blue and move on to green.  I feel I still get significantly tighter when I don&#39;t dilate in the morning so I&#39;m still doing twice a day on days I don&#39;t have to go out early.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I ran out of ID Glide so started using KY Liquid which we bought accidentally thinking it was KY Jelly.  Liquid turns out to be really annoying in that it&#39;s hard to put on the dilator without dripping, and yet it tends to dry out more than anything else once the dilator is inside.  I also tried &#34;Slippery Stuff&#34; at the suggestion of a sex toy shop salesperson in SF and that tends to be almost as thick and hard to clean off as KY Jelly, yet it also gets stringy and liquifies enough to make a mess, so I definitely prefer KY Jelly early on and ID Glide in the long term.  Glide might even be good early on - I never tried it at that point.

I&#39;m annoyed my labia have gotten crinkly and darkened, looking more scrotal again.  I&#39;m doing another laser hair removal in a couple weeks so hope that will help, but will it keep going back to this?

I tried to get as good an angle on the vaginal canal as I could.  It still looks odd to me.  A bit swollen, red, with maybe a skin bridge/ridge on the left?  I keep wondering how I&#39;m fitting a dilator in there...

Abdomen scars seem a little more faded and the line in the bottom ones seems less pronounced.  I&#39;ve kept them covered in silicone tape.  Feeling like it will take another 6+ months for them to fade completely, if they ever do.  My tracheal scar did fade completely but I don&#39;t think it took this long.  I wasn&#39;t taking progress photos, though.
</p>
<p>
Six days ago I stopped using steroid cream after someone mentioned it thins skin and then I found
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228634/">this
</a>
article confirming it can do a lot of damage with prolonged use.  I&#39;m frustrated the doctor didn&#39;t give any instructions on how long to use it or mention it could do bad things.  But the article says skin should go back to normal after enough time with the cream stopped.
</p>
<p>
Four days ago I found the left labia scar was more painful than usual when I massaged it.  I noticed if I squeeze around on the lower left it sort of feels like 1cm long firmer line is under the       skin.  It seems slightly mobile and hurts a bit to squeeze but I squeezed on it for awhile trying to break it up but it didn&#39;t seem to dissipate.  My best guess is it&#39;s part of the 3 month sutures or &#34;staples&#34; that still hasn&#39;t fully dissolved.  If I push near clit hood it feels like there may still be a sore suture piece there, too.  Things hurt more after rubbing it but as of today it seems less painful than before I rubbed and I haven&#39;t noticed the lump (though I suspect it&#39;s still there if I search harder).
</p>
<p>
This last week I&#39;ve been sitting in my recliner chair 2-4 hours a day.  Tailbone pain has mostly resolved though I can feel it getting slightly sore after enough time.  It doesn&#39;t feel like I&#39;m putting any pressure on my groin but every time I get up it&#39;s a lot more sore than usual so the position must have some effect.  Groin has been significantly more sore in general and dilations seem tighter and generally more sore. I&#39;m having trouble getting the blue dilator to full depth as it first reached a week ago and it hurts more. I think labia pain is gradually improving but it got worse before it got better and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s better after a week than before I started sitting.  It&#39;s also possible stopping steroid cream has made things swell internally and that&#39;s leading to more difficult dilations.  Whatever the case, it&#39;s frustrating to feel like I&#39;m regressing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been getting increasingly smelly the last 3ish weeks.  I&#39;m not sure what changed but four days ago I tried feeling with my finger where the bidet spray was going and realized I&#39;ve only been rinsing the lowest bit of my slit this whole time.  To reach the front I have to set the spray as far forward as it goes and really push myself back.  It&#39;s hard to feel where it&#39;s hitting except when it touches my clit and that tends to be tickly.  Since I can feel the touch of my finger reasonably well, I&#39;m not sure why I can barely feel the spray.  But since I&#39;ve been spraying farther forward the smell is much better.  At first I had some issues where it felt like water might be shooting up my urethra when I moved to certain positions but I fixed that by resting some weight on my hands on the back of the seat and rocking my hips quickly over the water stream so it&#39;s never in one place more than a moment.
</p>
<p>
A few days ago I noticed while peeing that it was going straight down and thought &#34;that finally feels like it should&#34;.  It doesn&#39;t always go straight down but I feel like it&#39;s doing it more often.  Usually it still goes to one side towards the end as the pressure reduces but not always.  It&#39;s oddly satisfying when I get a full session of straight down.
</p>
<p>
My huge
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R5BCYE">128fl oz ID Glide
</a>
bottle came a few days ago.  It&#39;s great to not keep wasting little tubes of KY Jelly every couple weeks and to have something that washes off easily.  I just refill my smaller Glide bottle when needed from the huge bottle.  I just noticed it&#39;s also made in the USA so that&#39;s great for the local economy and for preventing shipping things across the planet, and it&#39;s much cheaper per fl oz than the small bottles.

I&#39;m not too keen on how the labia are remaining crinkly and red and how the white swelling has reappeared near the vaginal canal since I stopped using steroid cream.  I suspect the crinkliness is due to swelling from sitting a lot more often the last month or so, so I hope it will resolve eventually, along with the white swelling.  The definition between labia minora and majora also continues to diminish.  I don&#39;t blame the doctor for any of this as I think these issues are inevitable for most people and may be why people don&#39;t like sharing photos beyond the first 3-4 months.
</p>
<p>
9-11-21 I had laser hair removal done again.  It didn&#39;t cause the burning of dark patches of skin like last time and I was in much less pain when it was done compared to last time.  It didn&#39;t end up doing anything too significant for lightening remaining dark patches.
</p>
<p>
9-16-21 I had a video followup appointment with Megan at MozaicCare.  She hadn&#39;t heard anyone report tighter dilations after stopping steroid cream so my tightening might not be related.  She said I should find a local gynacologist to examine me for granulation tissue and I could also try pelvic floor physical therapy.  I can also reduce douching to once per week or two and watch for changes in smell, discharge, or especially cottage-cheese like discharge.
</p>
<p>
She also said it was safe to put &#34;moderate pressure&#34; on the dilator to maintain full depth.  I feel like I might be going beyond &#34;moderate&#34; but if I reduce it, it won&#39;t keep its depth.  I asked about twisting the dilator to spread lubricant and she felt that shouldn&#39;t be necessary.  She&#39;s right that it spreads itself fairly well just by pushing in and out instead of twisting, though I do feel twisting during the first inch or two helps lubricate the labia that otherwise tend to stick to the dilator and get pulled in.  She said dilation was hard for most patients during the first year so probably what I&#39;m going through isn&#39;t too unusual.
</p>
<p>
Dilation continues to be tighter and more painful than a month ago, leaving lingering soreness when done.  I did discover that when dilator is near full depth, if I clench my internal muscles a bit like I&#39;m trying to go #2, it lets the dilator slide in fully.  It&#39;s counterintuitive that clenching would let it go deeper but it works for me, so don&#39;t be afraid to use your muscles in unexpected ways to reach full depth.  Once I release the clench the dilator tries to push out again and must be held with pretty firm pressure.  At that point it often hurts to keep it at that depth, especially with the blue dilator, but I did notice this morning the blue was hardly hurting at full depth for the first time in weeks.  I continue dilating in morning and evening when possible because it definitely gets tighter if I don&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
My libido seems a little stronger and at one point I masturbated two days in a row.  Clit feels a bit more sensitive and I had my first wet-dream orgasm a few days ago.  Wet dreams are quite rare for me and I think I&#39;ve only orgasmed from them once or twice in my life, so this was unexpected.  If it happens again I certainly won&#39;t mind.  Megan said 9 months was the average time till first orgasm, so at least I&#39;m well ahead of average on that to make up for being well behind on healing speed.
</p>
<p>
I learned that vaginal chafing is a
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/treat-vaginal-chafing-keep-coming-163325861.html">thing for cis women too
</a>
and sweating makes it worse, so that probably explains the chafing I described in my last post.  Last week I drove to a work conference which involved a 14 hour drive (trading off with my SO).  Along the way we stopped and walked a fair amount for sightseeing and despite reapplying baby powder every 30 mins or so, I had some pretty bad thigh chafing in the 95F heat.  It was too hot to wear pants though probably nylons or cooling exercise tights would have been a good idea to bring.
</p>
<p>
During the drive I discovered I could use two strips of toilet paper (about 3 squares or 10&#34;) on both sides of the front of the U-shaped toilet seats common in public restrooms, then lean forward on those strips without touching the back of the seat.  This is much faster to set up than the full-seat covers which are often missing and it wastes less material.
</p>
<p>
At the conference I was subjected to hours of sitting in chairs with hard, straight, tall backs and poor seat padding for 3 days.  I had luckily packed a pillow to sit on and another rectangle one for my lower back, and those helped a lot.
</p>
<p>
During the first meeting at the conference I realized I could sometimes smell my vag through pants and panties and that was rather embarrassing wondering if anyone else noticed it.  So I showered extra carefully and douched and read that it helps to go commando in bed to dry things out.  That led to extra pain from being dry but all of that did mostly eliminate the smell.  I also took a bath the second day which was the first time I&#39;ve been submerged in water since surgery and it probably helped clean things too.  By the third morning I felt I needed the douche and careful cleaning again.
</p>
<p>
The afternoon of the third day we did a 2-3 hour hike up and down some decent inclines and that was by far the most strenuous activity I&#39;ve done since surgery.  Thanks to wearing pants and using a &#34;Gold Bond friction defense&#34; stick I picked up on both my inner thighs and lightly over my whole groin, I didn&#39;t have any chafing pain from the hike.
</p>
<p>
The chairs and hike ended up hurting my back and neck a lot more than my groin, but I got to a point where my whole groin would hurt at maybe 2-3/10 whenever I moved, and then take 2-5 mins to stop hurting when I settled in any particular position.  It got pretty swollen as well.  So it made the trip a little grueling at times but I hope all the pain and swelling will lead to an improvement in healing after I recover.  On the third day after getting home I think I returned to the same low levels of pain I had before the trip.
</p>
<p>
Besides the bath, I also used the hotel hot tub and we stopped at a natural hot spring along the drive, so I&#39;ve now submerged the kitty three times without negative effect - once in fresh water, once in chlorinated, and once in... whatever chemicals/minerals a hot spring has in it.

<p>
The above pics show redness caused by being out driving for a day.  I didn&#39;t do much walking but presumably sitting and the car&#39;s movement was enough to cause some chafing and swelling.
</p>
<p>
The last couple weeks I&#39;ve had so many days where things were swollen and extra painful for no apparent reason.  I&#39;ve avoided sitting in my chair and remained in bed to try to get things to quiet down and I think they have but it&#39;s excruciatingly slow and has made me depressed off and on.  It doesn&#39;t seem right to still be in pain so often after so much time healing.  I also wonder if part of the pain increase is that the nerves are healing so may labia are getting more sensitive in general, which includes more sensitive to pain.
</p>
<p>
And then there are some days, like 9-30 and 10-9 where things are almost painless and I can touch myself in the shower and feel like I&#39;m touching a body part instead of an injury and it feels amazing and validating...  but in some ways, knowing what it should feel like makes the pain days even more distressing.  On 9-30 I was actually out doing errands and while sitting waiting for a flu shot I crossed my legs and it was the first time I was able to do so since surgery without pain.  Even after being out driving and walking a bit my labia didn&#39;t swell or look crinkly.  But there are other days where I get pain and swelling for no apparent reason so the inconsistency is really frustrating.  I think part of it might be every time I drive or even sit in my chair I pay for it with swelling and pain the next day, but sometimes I get it without any provocation I can identify.
</p>
<p>
10-5-21 I achieved my first vaginal orgasm (as opposed to a clitoral orgasm).  It was during a particularly long masturbation.  After 40ish mins of effort I was getting frustrated I couldn&#39;t climax and my clit felt less sensitive.  But I noticed it felt really good in my canal to thrust the vibe in and out so I focused on those sensations.  I felt like something was building but every time I rubbed my clit it seemed to pull me away from the canal sensation without adding anything.  So I mostly stopped movement on my clit and thrust the vibrator and reached a different sort of climax than I&#39;ve previously experienced.  Pleasure was focused in the canal or maybe my prostate and it was more diffuse and less intense than the clitoral orgasm but also harder to resist vocalizing.  My clit didn&#39;t have its usual sense of pleasure or pulling away as in previous orgasms so I&#39;m pretty sure it was different.  It&#39;s curious that I seem to have achieved clitoral orgasm before vaginal because it&#39;s supposed to happen in the opposite order.  It may indicate the new clit method produces more sensate results, although I don&#39;t like it aesthetically as much as the old method.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been going commando a lot more often, always during the night and often during the day, and I feel like it&#39;s caused the labia skin to become tougher/thicker.  It helps reduce bad smells and I think it also reduces pain, though it&#39;s hard to be sure.  I used to always get pain that seemed related to dryness when I didn&#39;t wear panties and now I don&#39;t get that too much.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I did some research and I think it was a big mistake to remain so still for so much of my healing.  Soft tissue injuries need movement to heal properly.  I should have been more careful to do at least 30 mins walking each day as well as sitting and massage.  Trying massage the last couple days seems to help.  It hurts while I&#39;m doing it but it feels better for awhile after.  We&#39;ll see if that can get me anywhere.  Heat is also supposed to help.  I think everything should be done in fairly small doses 2-3 times per day.  Trying to suddenly sit for hours just aggravates things too much.  I should probably find a physical therapist but it&#39;s really hard for me to ask for help in an area that&#39;s so private.

I was wondering about the not-moving part, honestly, and I thought about asking much earlier on. :( Still, bodies adapt, and yours will!  I&#39;ve been checking back often for updates, and I&#39;m pulling for things to keep improving! ^_^

Thanks again for the running commentary!

Thanks!  They gave me a bundle of 4 dilators: Orange (#P2), purple (#1), blue (#2), and green (#3) from smallest to largest.  They&#39;re pictured and labeled
<a href="https://www.soulsource.com/collections/rigid-plastic-vaginal-dilators" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
But they sell one smaller than the orange (#P2) and that smaller one is also purple (#P1), so it&#39;s confusing.  Thus I&#39;m wondering if they gave you the absolute smallest one (#P1) or the third smallest one (#1) to start?  They had me start with #P2, the orange one.  I don&#39;t think they would have started you with #1 but if you started with #P1 then moving to #P2 seems more reasonable at this point.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I never gained depth and doctors always say gaining depth is impossible without another surgery.  If anything I lost maybe half a centimeter which almost everyone does as they heal.  But as I said, as long as you&#39;re reaching at least the second to last dot, then you have at least 13cm and that&#39;s plenty for most partners.  Partners that are longer won&#39;t fit in most cis vags either.  The depth you end up with mostly depends on how much length there is from outside your body to the start of the abdominal cavity.  For me, that was something like 16.8cm and it&#39;s now around 16.5cm.  For you, it sounds like it&#39;s around 14cm.  That&#39;s above the 13cm goal so you&#39;re doing fine.  You won&#39;t be able to force it deeper without damaging things.

Now that I understand you&#39;re on P1 I think you probably should start moving to P2, especially if your doc says now is the time.  Most people will get tighter around 2 months and some resort to using a smaller dilator during the tighter period if the larger one is causing too much pain or bleeding.  Since you&#39;re already on the smallest one, you won&#39;t be able to go smaller if you need to unless you start to stretch up to P2 now.
</p>
<p>
Also, I hate to mention it, but most guys are thicker than the #1 purple dilator so you will probably need to make your eventual goal #2 blue at least.

I&#39;d say go at your own pace.  You don&#39;t have to size up if you don&#39;t feel ready.  See a gyn and see what they think.

It is a very good result, your vulva looks very natural, I have some questions about your experience with Dr. Wittenberg (well, there are a lot of them), could you please help me? I plan to undergo this technique (or the non-inversion technique): Did you undergo the hybrid technique (where half of the vagina is skin and the other half is peritoneal tissue) or the full technique (where only the first inch or two)? What surgeon did SRS on her? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? Are you satisfied with your results? Are hoy planning to have a revision surgery (is a very good result and you still don&#39;t heal completely)? And if you plan to hace one, What would you improve your result with one?  What is your vaginal depth? How is self-lubrication? Do you shower or is there some degree of self-cleaning in your vagina? How have the dilations been?, That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

I had what you&#39;re calling the &#34;full technique&#34; where the entire vaginal canal is peritoneal tissue.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon was Dr. Wittenberg exclusively.
</p>
<p>
I think aesthetics are as good as they can be given the nature of the surgery.  For example, it would look better without scars, but that just isn&#39;t possible.  I wish labia majora were more springy and less like crepe paper but I think that&#39;s likely a problem with my age and my genetics - I have the same issue with my eyelids.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t plan on an revision, though honestly the results would have to be pretty terrible to make it feel worth going through all the pain and expense again.
</p>
<p>
Sensitivity is fine.  I never felt like anything was truly numb, just less sensitive than usual.  When I had FFS, much of the top of my head was so numb and felt like I was wearing a hard hat when I touched it.  Bottom surgery was nothing like that.  It still takes 9-12 months for full sensitivity to return.
</p>
<p>
Depth is ~16.5cm.
</p>
<p>
Self lubrication is good.  It seems to increase with friction, so like a vibrator will make it become slick and I assume a partner thrusting would do the same but I won&#39;t be stretched enough to test that for awhile.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough transudate lube to insert something dry, but once you coat something in water-based lube, the transudate keeps it moist so it doesn&#39;t dry out.
</p>
<p>
I rinse it after each daily dilation and douche twice per week by doctor&#39;s orders but there is some evidence that the transudate that makes it through peritoneal walls lowers the ph closer to a cis-vagina so douching may not be needed in the long term (it&#39;s main purpose is to prevent yeast from growing too plentiful).  Peritoneal tissue is supposed to morph to become indistinguishable from cis-vaginal tissue after 3+ months so it should be as self-cleaning as much as a cis vagina would be.  As far as I know, the only cleaning mechanism is maybe transudate and gravity slowly pushing out foreign stuff and yeast tending to out compete other microorganisms.
</p>
<p>
You can search through my post series for &#34;dilat&#34; to see how dilation progressed over time but I would say overall it was always a chore but never enormously painful or problematic.  At this point it&#39;s easy and only provokes minor discomfort sometimes.  I did read one account who said dilation became like masturbation after a few weeks but it doesn&#39;t inherently provide pleasure in my case unless you add vibration and pressure in the correct places.

The only mucus I&#39;ve seen is the &#34;green slime&#34; I mentioned a few times in my posts but I haven&#39;t seen it in a couple weeks.  The only skin that should be able to produce mucus in small amounts is the urethra, and there is urethral tissue extended out around the urethral opening.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re trying to ask if the entire vaginal canal is peritoneal tissue or is some surface skin graft, then the answer is it&#39;s all peritoneal tissue.

They say with ppv technique they use a part of skin and a part of peritoneal. But i don&#39;t feel any skin i can feel some slippery membrane right from my vaginal opening (they were stiches around vaginal opening). But i have read in some previous posts Dr suporn also uses some urethral tissue around vaginal opening.Also, there was a post some German surgeons also do that. maybe i misunderstood.

There are many variations of techniques that use peritoneal tissue.  Some use skin from inside the scrotum (I&#39;ve heard it called peritoneal skin but I can&#39;t find any anatomical pictures that show the peritoneum extending into the scrotum) but there isn&#39;t enough of that skin to form the full canal so they usually just form the deepest part of the canal with it.
</p>
<p>
If you have 4-5 scars in your belly from them inserting cameras and surgical equipment, then they almost certainly used a graft from the peritoneum for some or all of the vaginal canal.  Otherwise, they might have used the scrotal skin or they just did a penile inversion.  You&#39;d have to ask your doctor for details.

I&#39;m having the same procedure in November, and I really, really appreciate all of your time and effort in documenting your experiences—it&#39;s extremely helpful.
</p>
<p>
Thank you. &lt;3

Just made my mini update.  I&#39;m doing well other than frustrated by the lingering soreness.  I hope you&#39;re doing well, too!  I know you were having a lot of pain from granulation early on.

Thank you for this. I’m feeling generally better. I’m 5 months post-op on September 6th.  There’s been  a little bleeding during dilation lately. I am not sure why because I hadn’t  been bleeding for the last two months until lately. I’m guessing the steroid cream made the skin thinner? I read in the instructions that one of the side effects of steroid cream is it thins the skin I’m not sure. I’ve been feeling a little sore too lately and sitting is uncomfortable to painful. I lost depth but I don’t really stress out about it. 2 to 2.5 dots visible on the orange dilator and 3 to 3.5 of the bigger purple. The bigger purple hurts. I just tell myself to take my time as it is not a race.

I hadn&#39;t heard about steroid skin thinning so I researched and found
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228634/" rel="nofollow">this
</a>
.  Basically yes, it can thin skin, cause atrophy, and various other problems so if you&#39;ve been using it for awhile you should probably stop or send photos to the doctor and ask their advice.  I&#39;m frustrated the doc never gave any instructions about when to stop or mentioned any problems with prolonged use.  I think I&#39;ll also stop since the vaginal canal looks reasonably ok from what I can see in photos.
</p>
<p>
The only other theory I have about bleeding is maybe trying to stretch larger too quickly.  So maybe stop the larger dilator for a few days and see if bleeding stops.  I suspect it&#39;s always going to make things sore to use a larger dilator but my experience has been the soreness diminishes over time.
</p>
<p>
As long as things don&#39;t hurt excessively I do think you will recover more quickly by not letting the soreness from sitting stop you from sitting.  But if you feel you&#39;re making things worse then ease off or ask for medical advice.
</p>
<p>
2-2.5 dots visible still sounds good.  Hope you keep healing well!
