I was wondering if anyone had any experience with vaginoplasty despite having ehlers danlos. I have mild EDS classic type and had vaginoplasty about a year ago with Dr Burke at ECMC. I had massive swelling, apparently the most they&#39;d seen, and a fair amount of dehissence (sutures popping). Because of this I have a fair amount of scar tissue around my vaginal opening which I&#39;m trying to break up through dilating, it&#39;s been slow going. They tried to remove some scar tissue/open up the vaginal opening when I had a revision, but it mostly dehissed and scarred in again. I&#39;m just getting to the point where I can almost get the full diameter of the p2 (petite orange) dilator inserted but it takes a lot of warm up each time and that&#39;s only about 1 inch in diameter which is less than I was hoping for. My surgeon was fine but not great so I&#39;m debating whether getting another revision with a better surgeon would be worth it or if I&#39;ll just keep getting more scar tissue. Debating seeing a pelvic floor Physical therapist to help break up scar tissue adhesions. Anyone with similar experience would be great. Thank you.

Only at the opening. And the rest of the canal seems wider in diameter its just tight at that one spot.

I’m not sure if I have EDS but I suspect I might (it’s seems to be comorbid with GD). My results were good but I also had massive swelling and bleeding to the point of needing a blood transfusion one week post. While it’s mostly a good results there are some cigarette paper atrophic scars or my groin crease. Same happened with BA scars. Thankfully in a LTR so I don’t have to worry about anyone noticing anymore.

Yeah I have some of those atrophic scars I&#39;m not so worried about the visible ones just the scar tissue around the vaginal opening not being very stretchy. But thanks, sorry you had those complications, hope you&#39;re doing well!
