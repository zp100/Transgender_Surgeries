<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fyrxcn/dilation_tips_to_maximise_depth/content.html">Over a month ago, I posted asking for tips on gaining (new) depth.</a>
</p>
<p>
In the name of data compilation, I am very happy to report that I have gained approx 1.5-2&#34; of depth, overall. The 6-inch mark on my dilator now sits flush with my labia minora. This was achieved simply by putting extra pressure on the dilator, as advised on the previous thread and by my surgical nurse when consulted. I occasionaly use coconut oil as a lubricant, which has had the added effect of softening the skin around my pelvic floor considerably.
</p>
<p>
It should go without saying that my quest for depth has come from a desire to have as comfortable and ordinary sex life as possible, in that I&#39;d like to be able to succesfully accomodate a normal sized penis when the time comes. I count myself very lucky.

<p>
this matches my experiences: it is possible to gain or regain depth, contrary to what the surgeons proclaim. I had told you about 25%, I was expecting you would get a 5&#34; final.
</p>
<p>
6&#34; is extremely good. congratulations! Did you use strong painkillers? Now you may want to consider testosterone cream or estriol to increase the amount of elastin in the graft and reduce the possibility of later contraction, as you went much beyond 25%
</p>
<p>
however, a warning for the other who want to attempt that: it is usually within the first 3 to 6 months after surgery. the possibilities later are much reduced.
</p>
<p>
I see from the other posts you had surgery 4 month ago. I do not think such results are replicable much further than than 4 month mark (1.5 to 2&#34;) but 0.5 to 1&#34; might within 6 month to 1 year. I do not know if the effect can be cumulative.
</p>
<p>
The longer time elapsed since the surgery, the harder it is to gain, and the lowest the gains

Could you elaborate a bit on what you experienced and which surgeon?

This was sometime ago, and I&#39;m talking from memory. I may have a mistake here and there as I have my notes at the bottom of a cardboard box with bunch of school books on top and that shit is heavy and dusty so I&#39;m not opening it lol
</p>
<p>
With Suporn, I gained about 1.5 inches in the first 2 months, to about 7.5 as measured with the L
</p>
<p>
Due to serious disease, I could not dilate for a while at about 8 month post op. It was not SRS related but really bad and I didn&#39;t have my mind on that. It was about 2 month stop. Hard to remember, it&#39;s a bad experience I try to forget
</p>
<p>
I lost about 1 inch, and have since regained / relost/ regained some of that. Currently,  at least on the S, I&#39;m at 6.5, on the L I used to be at 6 but working up
</p>
<p>
Then a few month ago I have lost the M dilator (yeah my bad, don&#39;t do drugs kids) making it tough to work with just S and L so I&#39;m back to 5.5 on the L while still at 6.5 on the S
</p>
<p>
I will try to get soulsource or something with E3 oil to go back to at least 6.5 on L
</p>
<p>
But this means, in my experience that you can gain some depth after surgery, and it&#39;s a good thing if you do bc it acts as a &#34;buffer&#34; in case you are sick or something and can&#39;t dilate. And it&#39;s like permanent gain, as I can still get to 6.5 easily while Suporn had announced to me post surgery I had 6 inches.
</p>
<p>
It is still unclear if I will be able to go to 7 in S, but I believe it&#39;s worth trying with T, E3 and good painkillers

<p>
Plenty of paracetomol and, upon occasion, some codeine. Unsurprisingly it was really quite painful - though it has reduced in the last week or so.

<p>
Funnily enough, my care provider has previously floated the idea of putting me on a very low dose of testosterone. Cream on the dilator might suffice on both counts.
</p>
<p>
I think you are quite correct in that as time passes, the window closes. That said, the aforementioned surgical nurse told me that some of her patients have reported gains having started trying at 6-months post. That would possibly be the latest chance of gaining a significant amount.

My pleasure! I like it when my practical knowledge can help others. This is why I hang on this sub. I know quite a few dirty tricks that can be EXTREMELY helpful.
</p>
<p>
Yeah I&#39;ve got an attitude problem and I do drugs, so some ppl think, meh! But if they need help, maybe they should be less judgemental lol

Yeah I told you you&#39;d need some tough shit lol. I&#39;m not surprised you had to use codeine even if you initially didn&#39;t want to. But I also told you if you could fix the pain it would improve, and it did
</p>

<p>
Yes. If your care provider can get you compounded T cream, get that.

<p>
Unfortunately, that&#39;s true. We don&#39;t know why, but while a healing tissue can stretch easily, it much harder later. Maybe someday we will know why and be able to turn the switch back on?
</p>
<p>
I would suggest you report your precise dilation regimen here: I just did Suporn regular but spending 2x to 3x as long on each session. This is applicable for scrotum mesh graft
</p>
<p>
Your data could help for people who get penile skin graft.

Exactly my point when saying to not overshoot and have reasonable goals like 25%.
</p>
<p>
And don&#39;t really put it in the first month. You have 3 to 6 months to make gains

What was your dilation regimen like? Did you cycle through different sizes through the course of a session, how long did you hold them at depth, and how often did you have a session?

Mandated dilation since the 3-month mark has been twice daily. I have two dilators (25 &amp; 30mm diameter respectively), and a dilation session consists of starting on the smaller one, finding depth and holding in place for 10 mins. Rinse &amp; repeat with the bigger one. So, a min of 40 mins per day.
</p>
<p>
That said, I&#39;d say that overall I have put twice the amount of time in, to be safe.  I am now planning to use the 30mm exclusively, as I can achieve the same depth with both. Last month, I ordered the green 35mm dilator from Soul Source, and plan to factor this in whenever it arrives.

This is what I did too: longer sessions. I think they may be the key

Did you were asked by surgeon to do 4x or 3x times a day from the beginning? My routine was 4x 20 min each with 2,5 dilator. I never was able to do that, so sticked to 3x 30 min each (90 against 80 mins TOTAL). Surgeon said it&#39;s Ok... Anyway. But better to do more sessions with less time. Impossible for me.
</p>
<p>
After infections and reaching 4x a day, i was at original 5.5&#34; and soonly downed to 1x 1 hr a day for 1 month.
</p>
<p>
Now at 3 months I&#39;m re-reaching the schedule of 3x 30 min with All 3 dilators(#2 3cm and #3 3,5cm), that were added 2 weeks ago thinking &#34;those 2 will be so painful and will never get into&#34;, surprisingly the #2 slided like a charm at 2nd attempt, and the #3 cost me some &#39;ouuuchhiies&#39; first attempt then next week it all went 5cms into, no pain. Today #3 8cms into! She&#39;s next week surely it&#39;ll get full 12cm or some.
</p>
<p>
So, now 3x 1 hr daily, total of 5 hr because rinsing and prepping sessions is more busy than ever! Wish i could skip the  #1 but still goes the end and it serves as a lub dealer xD i have to lube #2 and #3 at all, just a bit.
</p>
<p>
I wish to regain the initial 5.5&#34; (14 cms) this month as soreness from infections and inner spikes of pain are less than 1 month ago. Paracetamol and sometimes benzos (when I&#39;m too crazy anxious) help, but need some diclofenac or those &#39;3 in 1&#39; pills for muscle relaxation (for the pelvic floor).
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m working the width while trying to regain depth,
<em>
as routine can be regained
</em>
.... Because this is the key. Finding time and tips to improve prepping times are my priorities now!
</p>
<p>
So scary to lose my canal after 18 years waiting for the SRS to happen was soooo sad :( Only a nice vulva but not having sex life is not in my mind.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m reaching 10 to 12,5 cms this week, will tell if next 2 weeks regained some more.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all for this post!

Hey sorry for the late response!
</p>
<p>
I was doing really well but with permanent bleeding, and plus hair regrowth. It all contributed to stop dilating for more than 6 months straight.
</p>
<p>
Surely losed some depth but psychologically, the bloody mess and hairs have more weight.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what it is and I&#39;m waiting to get my sh1t toghether and go to another surgeon to check it and see what is causing it. I don&#39;t hear of bleeding past the 2 year mark,....
</p>
<p>
Basically I am orgasmic normally and lost interest in penetrative sex :/
</p>
<p>
So lost interest in dilating aswell....
</p>
<p>
For as I know and was able to test, there are still 11-12 cms depth. I feel that in the bottom of the canal is the problem (bleeding).
</p>
<p>
Regards.

lmk how it goes. I&#39;d suggest you get 1) on top of a regular exam, an ultrasound  (vaginal, to check for nearby structures) that could have had an anastomosis with the vaginal cavity 2) if it finds nothing, an MRI
</p>
<p>
bleeding is not normal, especially 2 years later. there&#39;s something going on.
</p>
<p>
keep me informed!

I&#39;d certainly wait a little while. My surgical nurse only advised trying in earnest for extra depth after 12 weeks post-op. Times will vary depending on the type of surgery, but I suspect that this is the bare minimum.

If you have done as much as you could to maintain that original depth and it has still reduced, I&#39;d definitely defer to your surgeon. Do you mind me asking who they are? And as to what the donor material for the skin graft would be?

By all means liase with her in regards to your options, but going from what I&#39;ve read about her I&#39;d urge against any further surgery with her. Insurance may cover a revision with another surgeon, or if you&#39;re paying out of pocket there are some skilled Thai surgeons that can perform secondary colo for comparatively competitive prices.

I would think that there is more possibility of increasing girth than depth. This can be achieved by obtaining a dilator with a larger diameter than that of your current one. Graduated kits are available for those who have lost a substancial amount of width. Also, it seems that most penises when erect have a circumference greater than most dilators, ergo penetrative sex may also do the job.
