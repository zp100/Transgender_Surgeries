Title.
</p>
<p>
I had FFS six months ago and am now planning to get a hair transplant to hide the incision scar and because my hairline is pretty fucked (scalp advancement only gets you so far
<em>
:(
</em>
)
</p>
<p>
Though by the time I get booked in I&#39;d be more like 8 months post-FFS.
</p>
<p>
For those that got a HT after FFS, how long did you wait / how was it?
</p>

I waited about 8 months, my surgeon, Deschamps-Braly, strongly recommended waiting at least 6 months.

Ah neat, we have the same surgeon. :)  Looks like it should be fine then.

Probably a guy called Dr Bisanga in Belgium.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s had trans patients before so that was a plus, seems to get consistent results, and can get me quite soon.
</p>
<p>
Few options with all the COVID travel restrictions :(

Were you happy with your results?

He did his best. My hairline was fucked after ffs, worse than before and now u can&#39;t see any scar tissue and it looks quite natural.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a bit surprised by his waiting though. 2 months is incredible short.
