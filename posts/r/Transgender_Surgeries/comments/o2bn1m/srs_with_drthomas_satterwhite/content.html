Hey everyone!
</p>
<p>
I just had bottom surgery with Dr.Thomas Satterwhite in San Francisco! This is where I thought would be a great place to explain my journey so others have some ideas on what the process would look like (more detailed if you decide on this surgeon).
</p>
<p>
Consultation -  So I had my consultation in January of 2020 so I did have my consult in person, I am unaware of how they are currently doing consults. The night before, I was given a roughly 40 minute video explaining the procedure and this was so I understood the procedure but could also come up with questions to ask. Dr.Thomas Satterwhite has absolutely amazing bedside manners and made sure I felt comfortable the whole time.
</p>
<p>
PreOp -  So roughly 3 weeks prior to my surgery, I was emailed an online packet via DocuSign and this contained all of my Preop instructions as well as consent forms. I had roughly 3 phone calls with the various nurses I would be interacting with to double check and make sure everything was going to plan. I&#39;ll be honest, the day before my operation sucked as this was a day filled with prep work comparable to prep for a colonoscopy.
</p>
<p>
Day of Operation -  So on the day of operation, I arrived at 6:30am to the surgery center. They let me in, I signed a few forms, and then they took me back into a room where I changed into a robe, a hair cap, and these socks with sticky things on the bottom. Various nurses and the doctors came in and talked to me and did their various tasks. They then took me to the operation room and they hooked me up to various things however I do not remember much because I didn&#39;t sleep much the night before due to excitement. After I woke up, I was drowsy but I didn&#39;t feel much. Ended up ordering a lunch/dinner and I just ate there. Sleeping was a bit hard but I got a few naps in.
</p>
<p>
Day after operation -  Around 7am they had me transfer onto a different gurney and they took me to a hotel where a nurse was to check on me as well as teach my parents how to work and empty various tools and such. I had breakfast and then I chilled in bed for most of the day. Eventually, the nurse had me get up and walk just from my bed to the bathroom and back to my bed.
</p>
<p>
This is all I have done thus far, I will update everyone after my various post op appointments which occur every week after surgery. If you have any questions about the process thus far, don&#39;t hesitate to ask!
</p>

Congratulations.
</p>
<p>
I went to Dr. Satterwhite&#39;s partner, Dr. Grujala, last November. They have a great team. Feel free to ask me anything about my experience.

Are you going for hyperbaric therapy?

Yes, I do think it helped, but I don&#39;t really have anything to compare it to. It is a very supportive place. I would definitely do it again.

Hey!! Super congrats on your surgery and happy pride! üñ§ Do you mind me asking what insurance you used? I have Medi-Cal. I called their office, and they say they take it, but I just want to make sure. (:

Blue Cross Blue Shield, they will work to make sure everything with your insurance is ok, personally I say go for it but I may be a bit biased üòÇ
