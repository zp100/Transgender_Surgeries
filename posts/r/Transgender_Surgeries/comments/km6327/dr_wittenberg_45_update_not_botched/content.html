I have to start with an apology for really letting my emotions out on an amazing staff who did a good job.  But I hope it helps show people starting out that you will hit a low where you look and feel so bad you feel mostly regret.  It gets better.
</p>
<p>
First of all, it grows on you.  You get used to your body more and more, and it gets easier.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I&#39;m happy that somehow I&#39;m getting ridiculous amounts of lubrication.  I don&#39;t need lube to dilate at orange.  Still no orgasm, but everything feels good.
</p>
<p>
Now, I still need a revision.  Three months ago that felt like a death sentence.  But guys haven&#39;t noticed anything off so there&#39;s that.  But I&#39;ll detail what I don&#39;t like about my results that would make things better.
</p>
<p>
Always, it&#39;s been the lopsided, excess skin and fat in my labia.  You can actually see in one pic how buried my fingers get trying to open up, and I&#39;m a thin girl.  Definitely want that reduced and cute looking.
</p>
<p>
Labia minora fell apart, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll want any with the revision.
</p>
<p>
Lots of granulation around the clitoris still, need that to heal.  Clitoris is also too large for me and I&#39;d like it reduced.
</p>
<p>
I can feel my erectile tissue, kinda bumpy and weird.  I&#39;d like everything to be smooth and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s supposed to be exposed anyway.
</p>
<p>
Major dehiscence caused an ugly scar at the commissure, I hope they can clean that up.
</p>
<p>
Lumps are bc my sutures still haven&#39;t disolved.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t comment about porn star vaginas are unrealistic or what&#39;s cis looking.  I have my standards, I still stick to them.  But you will see changes past 3 months, I&#39;ll still see more at 6 when I see her again.  And in hindsight, I still don&#39;t think I would have chosen anyone else.

It looks great, but I also agree with your assessment. If you want a revision, go for it! I think it&#39;s awesome you stick to
<em>
your
</em>
standards, not everyone has the courage and tenacity to follow through.

I&#39;m scheduled with Wittenburg next year, your response is good to hear!
</p>
<p>
Did you get the penial inversion or the peritoneal pull through? if PI then where do you think the natural lubrication coming from?

PI
</p>
<p>
Hopefully not a vesicovaginal fistula.  It&#39;s arousal based.  And it&#39;s definitely vaginal bc when I insert things it&#39;s wet all in.  And I don&#39;t add any lube.

Natural lubrication is possible in PI because of the Cowpers Gland that secretes fluid (kinda like pre-cum) I’ve only seen little research on it but I know that’s a possibility!

Thanks for your open and honest post. I believe you had your surgery about 3 weeks after mine with Wittenberg. I&#39;ve noticed a number of the same things you mention, though not all. It does seem that perhaps Dr. Wittenberg needs to work on her technique with the labia minora.  Mine fell apart too, with the entire suture on one side meant to differentiate the minora coming out at two weeks post op. I&#39;m happy overall with my result, and it&#39;s loads better than what used to be there.  But I keep hoping my somewhat oversized vulva will shrink, too.  And they seem to be slowly, and I hope they continue to. I have also been bothered by the fact that I can &#34;move&#34; my clitoris because it was stitched to the muscle or base of my penis stump.  I hate that.  I don&#39;t want to be able you move it.  Cis women can&#39;t, and it causes me dysphoria.  It doesn&#39;t swell, it can just move in the same way (though much much less) as I used to be able to move my penis. Finally, I, too , have lube when aroused.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s pre-cum leaking out but sometimes is a lot and definitely is cool to have that happen.

had surgery with her 2 weeks ago. my right lip just came off lmao. like it disconnected from the bottom where it connects with the left lip, now it&#39;s just hanging like a piece of meat lol. so i guess this is what &#34;wound separation&#34; means. so apparently this heals over time to look normal again.

It seems very &#39;layered&#39;, like a lot of excess skin. It does look quite symmetrical.
