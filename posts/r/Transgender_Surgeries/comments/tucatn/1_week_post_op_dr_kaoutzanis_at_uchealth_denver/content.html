Still very swollen but underneath it all I can see some wonderful labia. Pain from recovery was honestly minimal from the surgery site. Most of the pain was from other hospital things (bed rest, uncomfy beds, etc.)
</p>
<p>
Can‚Äôt speak highly enough about Dr. K, Dr. Higuchi, and the entire team at UCHealth. They were all professional and kind the entire time. I never once felt uncomfortable with anyone :)

I‚Äôm so happy for youüñ§. If I ever had time off to move forward to this I would.‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π I‚Äôm sending my love and support your way. I truly wish I could bypass my Transphobic boss and get this surgery done. She looks beautifulüòç and I hope she heals well. If you need someone to chat with‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm here even though I haven‚Äôt had the same experience. Congratulations on the amazingness! üíï

They don‚Äôt at all. The issue for me would be taking off work for awhile, getting paid time off approval from my boss, still having a job after 3+ months off (no real light duty at my physically demanding job), busy seasons with no pto approved during those months, possible complications if something goes wrong in which I can‚Äôt return to regular duty, dilation schedule driving a straight truck 10-15 hours a day‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm not trying to distract from OP but my boss would find a way to be a dick even though I‚Äôm one of the best drivers at my location. I‚Äôm sure my union could protect me but they can‚Äôt stop my boss from making my routes crazier and more demanding than it already is (I drive anywhere between 400-475+ miles a day within a 150 air mile radius of my home location). I‚Äôm probably over thinking it but I‚Äôm not trying to make my professional career more difficult than it already is. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Finally! Some actual results from Dr. K! I was wondering when it would happen! Beautiful results! I wouldn‚Äôt expect less from a previous fellow from NYU Langone RBL and Zhao!

Looks great.  How is your depth.  What dilator were you able to start with?  Hope you heal well. Bridget

Oh wow, that sounds like a good experience. I had only heard of Dr Hyer in Denver, is Dr K new? How long of a wait for a consult and then the procedure was it? And were there electrolysis requirements?
</p>
<p>
What made you choose them? Is there a place where I can find more of his results?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for being willing to answer questions and if you need something from someone in the area, feel free to reach out.

Dr. K is relatively new to Denver. My weight for a consult was pretty short! Only a couple months, then I had to wait 3 months to get the surgery. So basically nothing. He does require electrolysis, and I had been doing it for a while already in preparation.
</p>
<p>
I chose dr. K because I knew he was trained by RBL, and I had heard not amazing things about Dr Hyer (both the surgery and everything after). I had already been going to the transgender clinic at UCHealth for a while, so it all just made sense! No idea if there‚Äôs other results. I couldn‚Äôt find any for sure, I may very well be the only person who‚Äôs posted results of Dr k on the internet lol.

Thanks for telling me! Yeah, I like that he was trained by Dr RBL (I have a consult with her set for two years from now, but I don&#39;t necessarily want to wait that long) and he does PPV . I am just starting laser and then will finish with electrolysis. But do you know about how long that takes?
</p>
<p>
Also what insurance do you have? Do you know if they take Anthem BC/BS?

I did about 10 months (~75 hours) of electrolysis and just barely finished in time. I have Cigna. They‚Äôre a major hospital so I assume they take anthem :)

I will be having surgery on the east coast in just over a month.  I am excited, but also a little scared.  How much can you walk, can you cook, what about driving or going to the store?

Well I‚Äôve only been out of the hospital for a few days, so I haven‚Äôt been walking or out of the apartment very much at all. This would be a very very very difficult recovery if my girlfriend didn‚Äôt live with me and was very happy to help.

Best of luck! The entire team over there from the surgeons to the nurses are amazing. Couldn‚Äôt recommend them enough. Feel free to follow me as I‚Äôll be posting more pics as the swelling goes down. It‚Äôs gone down quite a bit even from that picture and she‚Äôs beautiful! I‚Äôm so happy with her so far.
