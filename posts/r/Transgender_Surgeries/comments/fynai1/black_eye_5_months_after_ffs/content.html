Has anyone else had a black eye last this long after surgery? My left eye was super purple and swollen after type 3 forehead reduction.  The right was a little discolored but faded quickly. It‚Äôs been 5 months and my left is still pretty bad, the right has a slight discoloring but nowhere as bad as the left.  Without makeup it looks like I got punched in the eye. Even with makeup it‚Äôs hard to hide and I get asked about it in public all the time.  Has anyone else had this happen this long after surgery? Did it eventually go away? If it doesn‚Äôt ever go away on it‚Äôs own is there anything I can do to help? It‚Äôs really frustrating after spending so much on surgery.

Bruising around my eyes lasted 4 months for me. It was subtle but there and it made me look tired all the time! Did eventually fade. FYI I am very pale so this is probably why.

My bruising lasted about 8 weeks. 5 months is a really long time to be bruised. What does your surgeon say?

I guess I should get ahold of them.  I haven‚Äôt talked to my surgeon since the surgery.  I was just trying to be patient waiting for this to clear up on its own.

talk to your surgeon. bruising shouldn&#39;t last this long. i have perma raccoon eyes 24/7 naturally  so my advice to you is place cold spoons on your eyes and cover up with concealer whenever going out in public

Huh. Very interesting stuff. Well just as an FYI I‚Äôm not trying to get rid of my raccoon eyes. I actually like them because my favorite animal is the raccoon ü¶ù lol
</p>
<p>
I got fat transfer as part of ffs and the laser resurfacing was to remove acne scarring which did not work. I should have gone with the co2 laser.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll definitely look into the estrogel

Thanks.  I‚Äôll look into that co2 laser.  Never heard of it.  I I do have a vitamin K eye cream that I‚Äôm using as well.  Helped at first but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs doing much anymore.

It may be hemosiderin staining. I have the same problem with my entire upperneck cause of a botched lipo by a surgeon in Belgium who did my FFS. I just can&#39;t see  another surgeon to confirm my concerns due to lockdown. I&#39;m almost 2 months post op.
