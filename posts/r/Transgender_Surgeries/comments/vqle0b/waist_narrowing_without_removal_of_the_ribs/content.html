Your post has been removed by reddit and I canâ€™t get it back. I guess because you have link to a Russian site, but I donâ€™t know.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s interesting so Iâ€™ve copied it here without the link

<p>
After doing some research I&#39;ve found that rib reduction without removal of the ribs is practiced by multiple surgeons in Russia. The surgery was patented by Dr. Kazbek Kudzaev in 2018 and a search for &#34;Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ð¾Ð´ ÐšÑƒÐ´Ð·Ð°Ñ”Ð²Ð°&#34; (&#34;Kudzaev&#39;s Method&#34;) yields multiple results. Prices seem to be around â‚¬3000. This surgery is also practiced by at least one Ukrainian surgeon,

</a>
.
</p>
<p>
It should go without saying that travelling to an active warzone is not recommended, and that in addition to perpetrating mass violence the Russian state is infamously hostile toward all LGBTQ+ people, however I feel that this is important information worth sharing here nonetheless.

Hey ðŸ’— I want waist narrowing so bad!!! I would say I have a really good passing. I also go to turkey every year and get surgery there. Do you think I could go to him and get the surgery without problems? I donâ€™t care about the people in the city or something like that. Iâ€™m just scared that theyâ€™ll botch me just cus Iâ€™m trans. I had this issue before my first surgery in turkey but when Iâ€™ve arrived everything was fine. What do you think?

Thereâ€™s no way of knowing without lots of independant reviews.
