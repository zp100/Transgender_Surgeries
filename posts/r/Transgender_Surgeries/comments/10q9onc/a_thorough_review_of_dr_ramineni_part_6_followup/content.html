This little series of mine is going to be highlighting my experiences choosing Dr. Ramineni as my surgeon. My goal is to provide as much info as possible so that people can make an informed decision towards whether they would or wouldn&#39;t want him to be their surgeon. Especially since he does roughly 135 vaginoplasties a year, but not many people highlight their journeys from going with him. This part involves going to my first follow-up appointment, my increased mobility/energy, and my first few times dilating!

</p>
<p>
My appointment was at 8:15am. I was originally quite nervous for it just worrying about the pain of the removals. When I got there I sat down in their little sterile rooms (the same ones they use for consultations). I was asked to strip down and toss on a gown. Then within a few moments Dr. Ramineni and his PA Katie came into the room. They asked how my weekend went so I gave them a quick little synopsis of my weekend. Then they explained the process and asked me to pull down my panties after Dr. Ramineni did some weird syringe thing to my catheter. Funnily enough my pad ended up sticking to the tube when I was pulling down my painties and d slightly pulling it out. So when he went to pull it out after my panties where on the floor he only had to pull like a cm or two out. ðŸ˜‚
</p>
<p>
Now came the packing; the seemingly scariest part! Dr. Ramineni sniped the stitch holding it in place and then gently explained what would happen next. Then he started to pull it all out. I was expecting like some big compact gauze thing to awkwardly be pulled out. I was not expecting it to feel like a long snake slithering out of me. It was 20 seconds of &#34;wooooaaahooooohhhhgg&#34; in my brain while I focused on keeping steady abdominal breathing going. I feel like this really helped me not focus on the pain. Then it was out and Dr. Ramineni and Katie both said stuff like &#34;congrats you did such a good job!&#34;
</p>
<p>
The final part of the appointment was getting taught how to dilate. This was another part that I was nervous about, but Dr. Ramineni has a really gentle voice and touch. He first explained all my bits down there while also excitedly talking about how nice it is to see the swelling starting to calm down. Then I just kept focusing on my breath again while he inserted the large purple Soul Source dilator into me. After which he explained my regime which is just the standard 3 a day for the first 3 months and starting to knock it down from there. Then we said our goodbyes and talked about when my next appointment will be (in 2 weeks).
</p>
<p>
Almost immediately after the appointment I started feeling so much more mobile. It really hit me when I got home how much more mobility and energy I have without the packing and catheter in! My two following dilation sessions went well! I made sure to gently make my way to the final dot while also practicing more belly breaths. I will say that I was heavily underestimating how fucking tired you get after dilating. I needed a midday nap due to the lil dip in energy levels. Dilating also is like a pee switch for my week bladder muscles atm. Even if I pee before hand (which is set to sprinkler setting ATM ðŸ˜‚) I still have to pee sooo bad the second I finish!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be stopping here for this post! Overall it was a great day and felt so wonderful to gain back some freedoms that I&#39;d lost from being so immobile before the removals. I most likely will be slowing down my posts to weekly or biweekly updates (unless an update is absolutely necessary) just because my days are going to start all being the same from now on. Just minor healing, a bit more energy, and a whole lot of dilation! Thank you so much for being a part of my little journey so far! I&#39;d like to do a review of George Washington Hospital (the one Dr. Ramineni uses) at some point so that may end up being my next post. But I&#39;ll see you wonderful people around! ðŸ¥°ðŸ’—ðŸ’–ðŸŒˆ
