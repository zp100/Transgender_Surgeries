I was doing daily walks out of my accommodation about 2 days after leaving the hospital (IIRC was in hospital for 2 nights after surgery). I flew home about 10 (or 11?) days after my surgery, but was really puffy and still bruised at that point. It was both great and annoying that the face scanners at the airport didn’t recognise me.
</p>
<p>
It was probably 1-2 months for the worst of the bruising and swelling to go down and 3 months before I was no longer self conscious. That may sound like a lot, but it’s been so, SO worth it.
</p>
<p>
I hope you have a smooth recovery!

I was going out on tours with my mom 4-5 days after the surgery.  Mostly driving ones and sitting at restaurants.  I was working as a pilot 3 weeks later.

I was REALLY bruised up and had the full head wrap on for a couple weeks...  Jaw took at least 3 weeks or so to be good with opening fully and doing normal food 100%.

The hardest part was not being able to eat normal foods or open my mouth much, I just wanted to sleep a lot but did spend a good amount of time up and about walking around my hotel and outside on short walks, about 4-5 days after for sure. I&#39;m a pretty fast healer so I was definitely ready to start moving. The face swelling was rough and I didnt really feel good about showing my face until like 2 weeks out, I would say at the 2 month point there was minimal swelling. I hated the head wrap! I really dont like the pressure and itchiness of it, but it was worth it to keep the swelling reasonable. See if you can take a shower or a bath, check with your surgeon, bc that was very nice in order to get the blood and gross stuff out of my hair.
