Hi! I&#39;ve waited
<em>
so long
</em>
to be able to make this post.
</p>
<p>
I had FFS with Dr. Jacob Kuperstock on 1/26/2022. Here is my story :)
</p>
<p>
The company I work for started covering FFS as part of their insurance plan (thru Anthem BCBS) as of 1/1/2021. When I learned about this (in late 2020) I was absolutely ecstatic that I&#39;d finally be able to get FFS after wanting it and it being absolutely cost prohibitive in the past.
</p>
<p>
So, during my search, I did 3 consults within a few weeks of each other in January of 2021:
</p>
<p>
Dr. Keelee Macphee (Durham, NC - about an hour from me, but doesn&#39;t take insurance up front so you have to pay out of pocket and HOPE your insurance reimburses you...which is not how I wanted to go)
</p>
<p>
Dr. Jeffrey Spiegel (Boston, MA - About 6hr from me driving, and didn&#39;t take my insurance so would have been out of network; still not a fun prospect)
</p>
<p>
And finally Dr. Jacob Kuperstock (Fairfax, VA). Out of all 3 consults I did, not only is he the only one that is flat out in-network with my insurance; he&#39;s actually the one I
<em>
vibed
</em>
with the best during the consult. He&#39;s an extremely pleasant person to talk to and will go into as much detail as you want regarding proposed procedures. He trained with Dr. Speigel and is the only one of the surgeons that has gone through both his training program AND a fellowship with him, so he spent quite a fair bit of time working and learning with one of the more competent tried-and-true FFS surgeons around.
</p>
<p>
During his consult, he proposed the following procedures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hairline advancement
</li>
<li>
Forehead contouring with brow reduction and brow lift
</li>
<li>
Feminizing Rhinoplasty
</li>
<li>
Lip Lift
</li>
<li>
Bilateral mandible contouring and chin reduction (I haaated my very prominent cleft chin, likely the biggest reason I wanted FFS)
</li>
<li>
Tracheal Shave
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the end of the consult, he asked if we wanted to move forward with trying to get all of this preapproved by my insurance so we can then move forward with booking a surgery date. I told him yes, and we got the process started.
</p>
<p>
Part of filing this with the insurance provider is submitting letters of recommendation from my therapist and my Endo/PCP (I would have done my actual PCP but my endo was basically my PCP at that time and they are nonbinary so I trusted them a heckton more lol). I got those done within about a month, and submitted those, along with frontal, side profile, and 45deg angle pictures, to Dr. Kuperstock for him to submit to my insurer on my behalf.
</p>
<p>
A month goes by. I get an update from Dr. Kuperstock that it&#39;s been approved but they are waiting on my insurer to provide their office with a &#34;Letter Of Agreement&#34; - essentially a &#34;we promise to pay you these rates and won&#39;t try to screw you over later&#34; contract. This is where stuff got a little tricky.
</p>
<p>
He talked with my insurer on the phone multiple times and spent hours of his time talking to my insurer on my behalf, and at some point, the insurer and him weren&#39;t getting any further and were at a standstill. Tis is where he asked me for assistance getting the Letter Of Agreement from them.
</p>
<p>
TL;DR, 8 MONTHS, and probably 5-6 dozen phone calls on my lunch breaks and off days later, Kuperstock sends me an email: &#34;Just letting you know that we finally received the letter of agreement from your insurer! Can you believe it!?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Because we wanted to try and do this earlier in a calendar year for financial reasons (paying the copay with my FSA), we made sure that the letter of agreement carried into the next calendar year. It did, but ONLY up until January 31st, 2022.This was okay though, and we scheduled for 1/26/2022. (it was Mid-September when the letter finally came through).
</p>
<p>
I spent the next few months getting everything ready.
</p>
<p>
Travel was going to be done on Amtrak, business class, at the suggestion of my GF (I&#39;m glad we did, it was killer and saved so much hassle vs. driving 5.5hr each way)
</p>
<p>
Accommodations were going to be staying at a friend&#39;s place in DC who has had FFS so knows how to take care of me (My GF was with me the entire time up there so it wasn&#39;t as big a deal)
</p>
<p>
The time was almost there. Then...disaster struck. It being the middle of January, 2022, (January 13th, 13 days before my surgery date) I woke up with the symptoms of COVID-19. I did a rapid test, and I was positive.(Fuck you, Omicron. I was boosted 6 DAYS before this!!!) I got really scared, really quickly, and shouted OH FUCK OHHH FUCK OH FUUUUCK and my GF woke up and asked what the heck I was yelling about. I showed them the positive test and they were like &#34;okay, you&#39;re right to be upset, 100%&#34;. I called Dr. Kuperstock&#39;s office almost as soon as they opened, and I almost started crying at the woman on the phone I was so upset. She put me on hold to do some checks with hospital policies and stuff, and informed me that because I was more than 10 days out from my surgery since the initial positive test, I am still cleared for surgery.
<em>
THANK. GOD.
</em>
</p>
<p>
I called my work, and the HR lady and my manager explained how the covid policy works and that I&#39;d be placed on a 10 day leave until 1/23. Paid by the company, and all that. Killer. That means I had an additional 10 days in front of my trip to get everything ready. (Covid symptoms lasted maybe 3 days at 3/10 severity. Get boosted if you can. It helps a fuck ton.) I told the HR lady &#34;so uh, yeah. about that. remember that surgery leave I&#39;ve been discussing with you for the last year, have filed for, and all that? that starts...on the 23rd of January. Guess I won&#39;t see y&#39;all until February 20th, then?&#34;  Her response was great: &#34;Wait, that&#39;s upcoming THIS MONTH? CONGRATS! Yep, that&#39;s correct, you will return on 2/20. Good luck on your surgery and I wish you a speedy recovery!&#34;
</p>
<p>
January 23rd, 2022. Amtrak trip up to DC. It was super nice. Business class meant we had ample legroom and free soft drinks from the dining car. My friend picked us up from Union Station in DC and we headed back to her place. It&#39;s okay, and I kinda wished we would have gotten an Airbnb, but this was free accommodation for 10 days. Not complaining.
</p>
<p>
January 24th. In-person pre-op appt. I finally get to meet Dr. Kuperstock and his office team (Ruth, the front desk lady, and the Nurses Quan and Annette) in person for the first time. They are as pleasant IRL as they are over the phone and Zoom. One of the team pulls me aside to take nice DSLR before-pictures. Then we go to the main room. Dr. Kuperstock greets me in a few minutes, and we begin going over the planned procedures. He gives me a mirror, and with very great detail, points at different parts of my face while he&#39;s describing everything with the wooden end of a surgical swab stick (like a long single-ended q-tip). We decide that the initial consultation was pretty much on-point and we decided that the hairline incision would go in front of my hairline, and that he&#39;d use the less aggressive of two lip lift incision types, both at my decision. We finish up and Go to the nearest pharmacy to pick up one last prescription he changed last minute (I had Clindamycin because my dad&#39;s allergic to Penicillin but he swapped me to Doxycycline instead. (fun fact, I am NOT allergic to Penicillin. woohoo mom&#39;s genetics!)
</p>
<p>
The night before surgery, 1/25. I become the most stressed out I&#39;ve been in a loooong time. I message the discord server that me and a few of Kupe&#39;s previous patients made, asking if they could kep me company and talk for a bit. We did, and my nerves calmed down a bit. Still got only about 3 hours of real sleep that night though.
</p>
<p>
Morning of surgery, 1/26. We get ready, make sure we go through our checklist of what to bring, and head over to the hospital (I had my surgery at INOVA Fairfax Hospital and the OR there is gorgeously nice looking (I spent some time as an OR sterilization tech for a few years, I&#39;ve spent plenty of time in ORs lol) We check in, I get immediately misgendered by the security dude out front (how ironic...). I wait till my name is called and my GF and I go back to the Pre-op area. They get me a gown and grippysocks and leave us two alone so I can get changed. A few minutes later, a nurse shows up and goes over what I&#39;m there for (I told her &#34;MAKIN MY FACE PRETTY- I mean, Facial Feminization Surgery&#34; in my not-enough-sleep humor, she giggled and says &#34;yep, looks right!&#34;). A few minutes later, someone else came by and stuck me TWICE to try and get a good IV (once on the back of my left hand. close but no dice. Second on right elbow where you&#39;d expect an IV. bingo!)
</p>
<p>
She followed up by putting a few things through my IV. One of them being I believe an IV antibiotic; which was the WEIRDEST THING IVE EVER FELT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. It was slightly cooler than room temp, and she warned me it might feel a little cold but that&#39;s normal. I then proceeded to feel like someone injected watered down menthol into my vein. It was not painful, it just felt HELLA FUCKIN WEIRD. I told her and she was like &#34;told ya it was a lil chilly didn&#39;t I?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Few minutes pass and Dr. Kuperstock comes in and greets me, goes thru everything one last time, has me sign some release forms and all that, and says he&#39;ll see me in the OR. not even 5 minutes later, the nurse comes by and says &#34;they&#39;re ready for ya, you all set?&#34; I say bye to my GF, give them the biggest hug I possibly could have, and tell them to have fun while I&#39;m gettin&#39; my face reconfigured. The nurse rolls me down the hall, into the OR, and Dr Kuperstock greets me one final time &#34;Heyyy Mica! you ready?&#34; I remember saying &#34;Hey Kupe! Yep!&#34; and them putting the oxygen mask on me....and then nothing after that, at all.
</p>
<p>
Next thing I remember is starting to gradually awaken in the PACU area, with my face entirely bandaged up and an ice pack strapped to the side of my face. I think to myself &#34;omg im alive woooo!&#34; but can barely speak real sentences yet. I don&#39;t remember much there besides them giving me some water and telling me the transport team would be there momentarily to bring me to my room (I stayed overnight one night). The transpost guys get there (from what I remember it was 2 25-35yo aged guys that were really cool. I remember giving one a  fist bump I think too after they got me in my room.....I was high as a kite)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the room for no more than an hour (I was siomewhat lucid at this point) and my GF, upon my months-in-advance request, waltzes into the room with their phone playing
<em>

</em>
and I&#39;m like YESSSSSSSSSSSSS they remembered :DD
</p>
<p>
I remember being fed a bunch of applesauce and having zero nausea during the entire recovery up until today even still. I stayed in the hospital overnight, GF was not allowed to, so after having my GF in there for an hour or two they escorted them out and they went back to the apartment for the night. Through that night I don&#39;t know how much sleep I actually got, because I was just in shock that IT WAS DONE. the procedure that took A YEAR to plan for, non-stop, was finally OVER.
</p>
<p>
That morning I was absolutely starving. I ordered Grits, chocolate pudding, and orange sherbet. Once it arrived I was so happy because I hadn&#39;t really eaten a substantial meal since about 6pm on the 25th. (We did a nice steak dinner as my final pre-op meal the day before, it was killer). I inhaled the entirety of what was brought to me.
</p>
<p>
Before long, it was almost time to check out. Kuperstock and a resident came by to do my 1 day postop visit where he had the resident hold the phone and record a detailed video on how to do my bandage changes and the hygeine instructions for the incisions and hair washing. He leaves, tells me he&#39;ll see me in a week, and heads out. I get dressed back into my normal clothes from the gown. About 30min after that, my GF calls me and lets me know that they are outside the front waiting for me. The nurse gets me a wheelchair, I get in it, and we head downstairs to the lobby. GF is right there waiting on me to show up.. The nurse releases me into their care.
</p>
<p>
Day 2 postop; January 28th, morning. I wake up and my eyes are swollen shut. How fun. I don&#39;t manage to do much but sleep at this point. I sleep until that late afternoon, and my eyes are somewhat opened again afterward, just in time for  when my mother is arriving in town to see me after my surgery for a few days. She arrives and we catch up on how the trip has been so far. Mind you, my friend&#39;s place wasn&#39;t the nicest option available but it was free. However, they were in the middle of getting ready to move that weekend and asked if it would be okay if we went and stayed with my mom at her hotel room for a night or two (she was leaving Sunday morning, it was Friday evening at this time) and me, my GF, and my mom were all like &#34;SURE!&#34;
</p>
<p>
We end up at my mom&#39;s hotel room and she has a huge ass king bed for us all to sleep in, comfortably. She has the idea, since the hotel a fair bit nicer than my friend&#39;s apartment, to cover the cost for us to stay up there in the hotel for the remainder of our DC stay....my GF and I were more than happy to accept the offer and that&#39;s where we stayed until Feb 3rd when we Amtrak&#39;d back home.
</p>
<p>
Feb 2nd was my 1 week postop appt with Dr. Kuperstock. I&#39;m still a bit swollen at this point, but my bruising was SUPER minimal. He commented on that and was actually really impressed by how good I looked only 7 days out.
</p>
<p>
What follows are two albums. The first is my recovery up to 5 days, and the next is before and after comparison shots from a week until 2 weeks post-op.

Great post. My FFS, BA, and GRS is at the end of this year. So, starting electrolysis, laser, working on my letters. I had my second consultation with my surgeon Dr. Esmonde from the Meltzer Clinic. Taking my HRT, etc..
</p>
<p>
So, I have a long wait as you did, but it’s nice to hear from someone who has completed FFS. You look wonderful!!

Thank you for sharing your experience. I’m glad you didn’t have nausea, I had it quite bad.
</p>
<p>
The whole hospital experience is quite bizarre, glad you were able to find the humor in it, and congrats on the affirming coverage!

He is absolutely fantastic. I can&#39;t recommend him enough, such attention to detail and is SOOOO good at side-profiles.

Congratulations; you look great! I also have Anthem, and just found out today that they cover FFS now; and this surgeon isn&#39;t too far from me! I will definitely give him a call when I&#39;m ready to start consultations. Thank you for giving so much detail about your experience!

From what I understand, I was actually the first one to get it covered with him through anthem since they started covering it on some plans; so Kupe&#39;s office now knows the tricks to get it to go thru easier.
