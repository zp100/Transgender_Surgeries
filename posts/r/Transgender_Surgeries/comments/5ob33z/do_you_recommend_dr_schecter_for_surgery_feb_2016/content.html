I would not recommend Schecter for surgery . He is very dismissive and rushes conversations in a very short sighted way.He is a low risk surgeon but doesn&#39;t have A grasp on the techniques he could be using.
</p>
<p>
My surgery resulted in the vagina’s depth being much shorter than average.He only was able to get 3.50 inches of a desired 5 to 6.   He handled my tissue in such a way that there is hair in my vagina still today. It is possible to have some removed  if maybe not all the hair removed but only in the first 2 inches of the canal.
</p>
<p>
Schecter has a urologist surgeon do the work with the urethra during surgery. This type of arrangement did not have good results for myself. Both my clit and urethra is functional but not actually medically accurate. I still have some dysphoria because of this and my urine stream gets on my clothes occasionally because of the placement and arrangement.
</p>
<p>
The most concerning circumstance is he left too much tissue that is around my urethra , the corpus spongiosum, so when I get turned on it feels like I am tucking. This is the hardest part for me. This results in me being challenged with some dysphoric feelings overall in my day to day and while being sexual.
</p>
<p>
For the follow up appointment he touched me with out asking first. He apologized and didn’t do it again— but consider I have not been comfortable or trusting to seem him again because the lack in consistency in outcomes.
</p>
<p>
I would recommend Dr Satterwhite, meltzger or bowers. I am in conversation with Schecter about my results in hopes that he update his practices in such a way to use his strengths and address his consistent problems Howard brown has seen both in my results and with other Howard Brown post op patients like myself.

In terms of depth, what were your penis lengths going in, and did either of you have scar tissue from previous surgeries such as an orchie?

I&#39;m sorry you had a bad experience. I don&#39;t want to take anything away from that, but I wanted to offer a different perspective.
</p>
<p>
I had a very different experience with Dr. Schechter and very highly recommend him.  Everyone&#39;s experience is different but I can say without a doubt that not many people in the medical field go as far out of their way to take great care of their patients as he does.  I work in the medical field and can say that he&#39;s certainly a surgeon.  He is very efficient, to the point, and professional.
</p>
<p>
He did a very meticulous job on my surgery and I am very happy with my results. I had a few small complications that are possibilities anytime someone has surgery but am recovering very well and Dr. Schechter is incredibly invested in my recovery.  He is very accessible and prompt.  His office staff is difficult to deal with prior to surgery but it is certainly worth it to work with him.
</p>
<p>
His technique is different than a lot of surgeons in the U.S. in that he uses urethral tissue to make the &#34;vestibule&#34; or the part of the vagina that surrounds the clitoris and urethra, so it looks pink and mucosal like a cis woman&#39;s vagina.  In my opinion, that is the best use of that tissue for this surgery.  I had very little tissue to begin with, did all the electrolysis requested before the surgery, and he was able to give me a deep (5 .5&#34;) vagina without any skin grafting from my belly like he thought I might need.  I&#39;m very happy with the surgery and the surgeon. He literally wrote the book on a lot of this stuff.  He wrote the chapter on &#34;transgender surgery&#34; in &#34;the&#34; plastic surgery text book.  I&#39;m happy to answer specific questions via direct message if desired.

So far the data on this page suggest he has a 50% success rate of desired results.
</p>
<p>
Did you get penile inversion or did he use the sigma graft (colon) for your surgery ?

Also are you sleeping with folk with innie or outies ?  The women I have slept with and even another one of his post op patience said &#39;it is very different&#39; ,  meaning that it does not have the athestic that is representative of the desired results of being indistinguishable.
</p>
<p>
I am happy for you and again the data in front of us shows 50%  success rate.
</p>
<p>
Two more questions : How are things when you swell up when you are turned on ?  Does the tissue protrude out of the vaginal canal ? It does for me.
