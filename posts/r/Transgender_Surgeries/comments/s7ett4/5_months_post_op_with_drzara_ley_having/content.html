I have to say I&#39;m VERY impressed with the result. I&#39;ve seen and heard many varied results, which has me on the fence. However, it&#39;s success stories like yours that make me consider this.  Congratulations and I wish you nothing but the very best for your upcoming finishing touches.
</p>
<p>
May I ask your care routine? Your minimal scar line is what makes it so natural. Previous surgeries I&#39;ve had in the past have left much wider scars. I&#39;m unsure why, but think it could be the aftercare that&#39;s doing it?

Thank you so much love ðŸ’— and to be honest during my recovery time I babied myself and made sure I had my routine down pack with my care. The first three months was really hard I made sure I washed after each dilation in use scar cream and Silvex for the wound care. I used kombucha and Kiefer every day so I wouldnâ€™t have a smell because right out of surgery itâ€™s smells really bad I had to get my ph balanced. Aftercare is really important Iâ€™m happy itâ€™s shows but I wish you the best on your journey and itâ€™s the best thing I have done in my transition.  I have had other surgeries such as full FFS, breast augmentation, Voice feminization surgery, and a orchiectomy before my Vaginoplasty.

Your procedures sound identical to my shopping list.
</p>
<p>
So please forgive the extra questions, but what order did you have these done?
</p>
<p>
Mainly when did VFS happen? I&#39;ve read a few places to get it last as intubation can sometimes undo some of the work?

I had my breast augmentation done first in 2018 then in 2019 I had feminine face surgery then voice surgery a week apart by the same surgeon Dr. Rolfes in Wayzata Minnesota at Omni cosmetic I highly recommend him. And I didnâ€™t have that problem my voice is really high compared from before. And youâ€™re fine you can ask as many  questions as you need.

I absolutely love my results sheâ€™s really amazing I couldnâ€™t be anymore happier. Its fully functional I have about 8 inches of depth, iâ€™m able to have sex and Iâ€™m able to have a orgasm. I didnâ€™t have much complications thank the Lord. Sheâ€™s leaving the Meltzer Clinic in March going out to California Iâ€™m gonna go out there and get my Libiaplasty done with her.

I still donâ€™t fully understand what you folks mean by labiaplasty. I mean, I do understand that it is mainly for aesthetic purposes, but I just donâ€™t understand if, for example, the surgeon takes a skin graft from â€” letâ€™s say â€” thighs and then build the lips, or if they work with the skin thatâ€™s already on the vulva. Iâ€™d appreciate more info on this procedure! Thanks, and good luck momma.

The labiaplasty would put a hood over my clit and give me a inner labia she used The shaft of my penis for my Canal and all the other skin is used for the outer vagina.

How do you feel about current results? What method did she use? I went to her for FFS and was nervous because there isn&#39;t much out there about her, but I really enjoy my results. Thinking of bottom surgery with her as well unless there is something with Dr. Stiller that is leaps and bounds better.
