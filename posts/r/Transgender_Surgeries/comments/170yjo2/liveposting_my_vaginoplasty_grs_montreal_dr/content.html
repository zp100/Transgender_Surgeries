Congratulations on getting all settled in. It&#39;s too bad about the headache, but I&#39;m glad your surgery area is not in a whole lot of pain. Maybe the headache was from the anesthesia? Hope you wake up and have a great day tomorrow and are happy. ❤️
</p>
<p>
Thank you again for documenting all of this process.

I think that&#39;s a likely explanation, or a reaction to the heavy pain meds. I&#39;ve never had either before so I couldn&#39;t tell you.
</p>
<p>
As an aside, my mom was given morphine once and said she had terrible nightmares from it. I don&#39;t know which narcotic they&#39;re giving me but it&#39;s certainly making things more &#34;vivid&#34;

Congrats. Day 5 will be another roller coaster and it will feel so freeing. I was on the main floor so I have no idea what the upper floors looked like. Also I didn’t know that patients were allowed to smoke. Also the pink on your tummy and legs is a sterile solution they put on you during surgery and it washes off really easily.

Thanks! I hope so, I&#39;m having a hard time resting and sleeping comfortably with the bandage on. The info booklets explicitly state no smoking from 6 weeks prior to 8 weeks post surgery, but it&#39;s not like anyone&#39;s going to stop you (and if you&#39;re a smoker you&#39;re already used to ignoring health warnings). About the pink, I was referring to the gross colour of the bandage; I know about the pink on my skin, but I&#39;m glad to hear it won&#39;t stain or anything :)

I found it difficult to sleep as well. You can ask them for medication to help you sleep, I did and it worked wonders. I’m also a side sleeper and I couldn’t find it comfortable until about week two.

Hope your stay goes well! I always vaguely wonder if people had the same room as me - I was in the one straight up the staircase then just one the right, kinda across from bathroom.
</p>
<p>
Those first days really sucked for me. Felt like I had to pee all the damn time. Getting the catheter out was such a relief.
</p>
<p>
Good luck on the recovery! Be sure to hydrate and get some walking in, but don&#39;t over exert yourself.
