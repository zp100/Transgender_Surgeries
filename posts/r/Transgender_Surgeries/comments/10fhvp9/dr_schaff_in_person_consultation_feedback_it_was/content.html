In the US, if you rejected every doctor who was 40 minutes late for an appointment, you simply would never receive any medical care.
</p>
<p>
The rest of it sounds horrible though.

This. You don’t want the doctor abandoning a patient’s medical emergency for a consult. The rest may be valid concerns, but it’s not uncommon for doctors to get tied up in the OR and says nothing negative.

Doctors are and can be late.  This is never a reason.  You know WHO mostly makes the doctors late?  Their patients.
</p>
<p>
And if a surgeon is late because they were in the OR... then I would cut them some slack.  Unless you are ok with any surgeon leaving your surgery to go do a consult.

Darlin&#39; I&#39;m sorry to say that you are indeed off-base with this one - I just had SRS and were you to have been in the operation theatre, I&#39;m sure that you&#39;d have been hoping that your surgeon was taking all the time they needed to do the work in the best quality possible.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, his response to other approaches is definitely red flags.

No offense, but your feed is littered with posts about “What do you think of this doc” and “Tell me about your experience with X” and it looks like you’re doctor shopping to try to find things wrong.
</p>
<p>
I’m not saying any of your concerns aren’t valid (being late and chewing gum is a little petty though), but you seem to go into your many consults already expecting the worst and even the slightest incident that is off putting triggers you into a “I knew my feelings that Dr. X was secretly awful we’re true!” and it sends you spiraling.
</p>
<p>
You’re entitled to find the very best care, treatment, and doctors for you, but is your time and money really best served globetrotting to various doctors and saying “Got you!” vs. truly identifying viable, real options that could provide you whatever level of service you’re seeking?

Chewing gum is fine. Chewing gum with your mouth open around me offends me and I think it’s unhygienic and overly unprofessional behavior for a Dr and poor manners in general.  Maybe my culture is different but that’s how I’m wired and it really doesn’t sit well with me.  Nothing wrong with elegantly chewing gum with your mouth closed
</p>
<p>
As for my posts I’m absolutely doing posts about “ how do you feel about Drx or z “ because I’m in the research phase of my Doctor shopping , I want the opinions of others to find the best possible surgeon that I get along with and that I feel who will be able to provide the best possible care for me

I would rather have a surgeon late because they were in the OR than be on time because they didn’t stay to finish, or didn’t spend the necessary time to give someone the results they deserve… 🤷🏻‍♀️

Right? The attitude here! Like the doctor is supposed to walk off and leave the surgery unfinished so Her Majesty doesn’t have to wait….Anyone who’s dealt with medical issues knows that procedures don’t always finish on time or that complications can arise. Honestly I think the doctor dodged a bullet here.

Imagine having a botched procedure that impacts your daily life and then find out the doctor had to wrap things up to be in time for a consultation with a potential patient.

I felt the same way when he said those things to me .None of what Dr Schaff said about PPT is true , absolutely none. Rest assured.  I think it’s toxic masculinity on his part , he thinks his technique is the best and upon hearing that a potential client is interested in something else it hurts his ego.  You’ll be fine 💖 Goodluck for your surgery.

Wait. All the girls who got PPT will be dead in ten years? Does this include the cis women for whom the procedure was originally developed?
