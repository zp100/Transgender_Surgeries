I was originally supposed to get a vaginoplasty in August with Dr. Jonathan Keith in New Jersey. He recently changed up the urologist he partners with for surgery, and this guy just constantly fails to make the consultation I&#39;m supposed to have with him.
</p>
<p>
This has caused surgery to be delayed again and again and again despite constant reassurances it would work out next time.
</p>
<p>
My most recent anticipated surgery date was the 30th, but Bhalla, the urologist, didn&#39;t do the consultation appointment again.
</p>
<p>
Work just isn&#39;t letting me delay this any longer, so I&#39;m just not going to be able to make this happen because this guy couldn&#39;t make a quick Zoom call for months. I&#39;d understand more if it was because of COVID, but apparently, it&#39;s not, he&#39;s just busy.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I&#39;m so devastated. I struggled for years to get to a point where the job I had and insurance would cooperate with this. And I was continually assured this could happen within days of meeting with Bhalla, and it&#39;s now months later and work won&#39;t let me reschedule anymore. Never felt this down about anything.

I was going to go with Dr. Keith for my top surgery but ultimately went with Dr. Lee in Rutgers Newark instead. Thank you for posting this because I had small doubts that I was making the wrong choice

I’m sorry that you had this experience. My child had chest masculinization surgery with him in July. It was an excellent engagement. He was in tune with my child. He understood all of their mental health issues and made the hospital staff bend and conform to my child’s needs. The emotional and mental support was phenomenal. The plastic surgery work was also very good. I would recommend him in a heartbeat. I’m very sorry that you’re experiencing this issue.

Honestly, this is the last fucking thing I want to be hearing after this practice ruined my chance of getting a vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I have NOT had this experience. I can barely get in touch with Rut, let alone Keith, and they just always tell me the urology appointment will definitely happen this time, and it never does.
</p>
<p>
And after years of working to get a job that would support me through this, my job won&#39;t let me keep rescheduling.

Leave me alone.
</p>
<p>
This was supposed to happen for me in July too, and the last thing I want is someone showing up talking about how great it went for them.
</p>
<p>
I missed out on a promotion at work because of how much trouble this has caused me. I was considered a shoe-in.
</p>
<p>
My mental health is an absolute trainwreck from these repeated delays.
</p>
<p>
I can barely even get in touch with them, and it feels like they just don&#39;t care. It&#39;s always the endless loop of &#34;we need the urologist consultation&#34; and that not actually fucking happening.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: Of course I get downvoted for being angry this man has completely failed me for months now, constantly promising this surgery is a couple of weeks away while not actually getting his urologist partner to cooperate.

Your being down voted for attacking someone who just said they had a good experience with the surgeon and offered their condolences that yours wasn&#39;t similar.
</p>
<p>
Maybe be appreciative of that instead of attacking them for something that isn&#39;t their fault.
</p>
<p>
Sorry your surgery was brought to a hault because of someone else&#39;s poor ability to manage their time, i can&#39;t imagine how devastating that would be.

That person isn&#39;t meaningfully offering condolences, they&#39;re here to defend Dr. Keith.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s shitty to show up where someone is venting and basically tell them they&#39;re wrong.

Nobody attacked anyone. Someone going through a tough time probably doesn’t want to hear about the great time somebody else is having/had. Just be considerate jfc

You do not deserve the downvotes at all. It&#39;s pretty fucked that folks here think that giving positive feedback about a doctor who is essentially screwing you over is ok. I&#39;m so fucking sorry that you&#39;re experiencing this right now. Nobody deserves this

Thank you. I truly appreciate that.
</p>
<p>
The one thing it&#39;s made me wonder is if I actually spoke to him again (which I haven&#39;t since my consultation with him months ago), this wouldn&#39;t keep happening.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a good chance the man himself doesn&#39;t even realize this is happening. They&#39;ve reserved dates for me but they were never finalized because the urologist kept flaking.
</p>
<p>
If this is going to happen, it has to happen soon, work won&#39;t keep accomodating this, so I&#39;m wondering if I can get in touch with HIM somehow and express how dire the situation is and how much this is really eating me up, something good might actually come of this.
</p>
<p>
I started transitioning in 2012. I thought I&#39;d be done with this long ago. And now I&#39;m worried I lost this amazing chance where work would let me basically take off until the end of the year.

If it helps, when I was having trouble getting in contact with the receptionist/insurance person for Dr. Lee, I personally sought him out myself and found his email online. I had sent multiple emails to the receptionist about the status of my insurance submission ( I didn’t even know if they had sent out my info or if they needed anything else from me in order to submit) and got no answer for a whole month. As soon as I emailed the dr himself, he responded within 30 minutes and had his scheduler reach out to me immediately the next day. Definitely try and seek out Dr. Keith if possible and let him know what’s going on

Thank you for saying this. I was committed to this idea before seeing this response, but I appreciate reassurances that it might be the magic fix.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon&#39;s receptionist keeps reassuring me everything can happen in less than a week from this urologist consultation once it finally happens, that the availability for the actual surgery is great. But the consultation keeps not happening for months. And I think Dr. Keith just isn&#39;t aware.
