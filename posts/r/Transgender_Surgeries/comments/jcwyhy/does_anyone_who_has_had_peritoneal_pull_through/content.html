Does anyone who has had peritoneal pull through vaginoplasty NOT get excessive lubrication?

I had the option with my surgeon to go with this method but he has warned against it due to women usually requiring pads every day because of it

I’m having mine done soon and excited af. I’ve been told that over time the lubrication tapers down. I don’t have a problem wearing pads most women do.

Just wanted to say that I think this can vary depending on how much of that tissue is used for the lining. I know some surgeons only use that tissue at the back of the canal which would in theory mitigate some of that risk (versus using it for most of the canal). My surgeon definitely doesn&#39;t expect excess lubrication to be like the default outcome or anything though there is a possibility.

My surgeon said it was unpredictable.  Also that it was constant, 24/7, and often required a panty liner.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t increase for arousal, and lubrication is often needed for sex and dilation.  Dilation is still lifelong.
</p>
<p>
The fluid is not very similar to vaginal mucosa.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m actually waiting for someone to say they just wear a diva cup all the time, skipping panty liners, and possibly using that advantageously as lubrication when needed.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I chose PI bc I didn&#39;t want to deal with any of that.  Nor did I want added surgical difficulties.  Nor the scar.  Nor did I want to lose my backup lining.
</p>
<p>
The benefit was that the tissue would be more pink.  But you can&#39;t even see in there, so idk.  Right now my vagina is constantly moist from dilation lube, and in the future I plan on just dabbing some mucogyne in there as needed.

How much is the surgery and is it covered by insurance?
