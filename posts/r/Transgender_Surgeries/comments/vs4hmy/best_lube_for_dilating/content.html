So I‚Äôve green dilating with sliquid for a few weeks post surgery however spilt a bit in my leg and noticed the skin turned red and raised. What other lubricant is good for dilation? I‚Äôm only 3 weeks post op so cannot opt for coconut oil.

Give any lube that is new to you a spot test on your skin to see if it causes an irritation reaction like that, it&#39;s a quick way to test of it&#39;ll be safe and work for you. If you have that reaction to a ton of different ones though, look into getting tested for skin allergies and go from there.
</p>
<p>
Until your suture lines fuse and are healed up nicely you probably should be using a bacteriostatic lube like Surgilube to prevent bacteria slowing down your healing. (Do be aware the stuff that makes it bacteriostatic can irritate some folks&#39; skin tho.)
</p>
<p>
After you are healed up enough, I recommend Good Clean Love brand BioNude lube. It lasts quite a while, is quite slick, doesn&#39;t have glycerin in it and is pH balanced to promote growth of a healthy vaginal flora.
</p>
<p>
I also recommend KY&#39;s True Feel silicone lube, as it is pure dimethicone without any other added stuff, meaning it should be safe for the dilators (Soul Source dilators are made of polyurethane FYI), and it works well, and the silicone may even help improve the appearance and healing of scar lines over time. This lube can be a bit pricey but a tiny amount goes a long way.

Thank you so so much for this detailed comment! I‚Äôve just re-ordered optilube which I used in hospital and was provided by my surgeon as I‚Äôve been using sliquid since I left the hospital (Yikes!) again thank you so much.

I highly recommend using a sterile lube such as SteriLube, until everything is healed.
<br>
Then it&#39;s trial and error for what works best FOR YOU.
<br>
I live by AstroGlide gel. McKesson, Slippery Stuff and Sliquid (liquid and gel) all gave me BV within a few days.

Update for anyone wondering! Optilube was like a hug to my vaginal walls, thick, good slide &amp; comfortable.

Hey! Thank you updating us on your experience with your new üò∏. I plan on having the procedure when I get cleared by the surgeon next year and am always looking for pov posts here.

I highly recommend the Ky thick formula, it&#39;s easy to put on the dialator and spread around. Doesn&#39;t drip off. And I feel as though it has plenty of slipness to allow the dialator to slide in easy. I tried JO LUBE which my wife and I used for anal sex and it&#39;s great to. But no consistency to spread on the dialator just drips everywhere.its also what the Dr. Used from the start for me and all medical professionals use Ky. So just a thought.  Anyway that&#39;s my expieeance with lubes.

<p>
I&#39;d look at the ingredients and try to work out whats causing the problem so you can avoid it with other lubes. Probably best test any new ones in the same way.
