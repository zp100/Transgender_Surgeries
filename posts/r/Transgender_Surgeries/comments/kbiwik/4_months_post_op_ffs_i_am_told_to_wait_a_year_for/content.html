I&#39;m really sorry if my other comment felt like I was criticising you, it was really never my intention. As I said, I think you look amazing and I only pointed out the lower hairline because I&#39;m a wig lover and because in another post you said that you wore a wig. It&#39;s just another accessory and I didn&#39;t know bringing it up could be offensive, my sincerest apologies.
<br>
Wig or no wig, higher or lower hairline, you look amazing and clearly made a very good choice of doctor. You are gorgeous!

I appreciate you coming back and making this comment to clarify things, I am sorry that I lashed out so bad. While I am open about my hair it is a very sensitive topic for me. I should have said so in my post earlier rather than just losing it.
</p>
<p>
I hope you can also accept my apology. Thank you for the complements I really appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
I have also used my old account to give you a platinum award as a thank you and an apology. I hope you have a wonderful day.

That was very sweet of you, but no need to apologise, honey. If you took it the wrong way, it&#39;s because

I should have been clearer when I wrote that, giving no room to think I was being malicious.

You are beautiful no matter what, even if one day you decide to go absolutely bald. Please, remember that! &lt;3

Aww thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è. I am scared of it too. I just stay home unless I am going for surgery. It‚Äôs worked out. Not like anything is open in my state anyway lol.

I wish you the best of luck with your surgery! Sending cozy thoughts and warm feelings ü§óüòä

That‚Äôs a complex answer unfortunately, i started HRT on July 2nd 2019. SRS was scheduled for April 14th 2020 and got canceled because of COVID.
</p>
<p>
I had to be off hormones for 1 month prior to surgery so I was off since March 14th and was told that if I stayed off hormones I could be the first up once they allowed it. Surgery finally got scheduled for May 28th. I had to be off for an additional 2 weeks after.
</p>
<p>
June 12th I took my first shot since March 14th and got a call from my FFS surgeon saying they could now get me scheduled and they would do it on July 25th. I got one more shot on the 19th and then went back off again for a month and a half. I cheated a bit and started again on August 7th.
</p>
<p>
My stage 2 SRS happened on December 1st. Which you guessed it I had to be off hormones for another month and a half. So here I am not taking my hormones.
</p>
<p>
Anyway in total I have taken 24 weeks of pills and 28 weeks of injections. Or 52 weeks of HRT broken up all over a 17 month period. I do question if the start of covid and the lengthy amount of time I was off HRT caused me to detransition a bit which would mean I would have to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù that time putting me even further back.
</p>
<p>
I wish it was more simple but COVID has really jacked me up.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: 17 months, 12 months, 52 weeks, less? Something? Idk.

Don&#39;t worry. Your face looks totally female and you got bottom surgery. Body feminisation takes years to happen anyways...

Hi thank you üòä. I have insurance through my company which covers both! There are several companies in the US which are this friendly to trans people as well as going through Kaiser. The two big ones I know of are Starbucks and T-Mobile! Both have great coverage and always willing to help out however they can!

Looking great, my dear. It also seems that you changed the placement of your wig, it doesn&#39;t look so low anymore and totally natural.

Eh it moves around and does it‚Äôs own thing. I get that you are trying to be a bitch here but honestly I don‚Äôt really give a shit that people know I wear a wig. Do I mention it everytime I enter a gas station or see some random Taylor? No I really don‚Äôt. Because just like unpleasant personalities women also wear wigs. The difference is they generally don‚Äôt point it out in each other for no good reason.
