<p>
In June of 2020, I saw Dr. Rodman for type III brow bone, hairline advancement, rhinoplasty, and tracheal shave. I have had no issue with the outcome of any of these procedures aside from the hairline advancement (the tracheal shave scar was quite conspicuous before a kenalog injection and it’s fine now.)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The scarring from the hairline advancement is, without mincing words, unforgivable. I realize that every surgical procedure results in some scarring, but this was beyond the realm of reasonable. Oddly enough, the scar in the front of the hairline better, but the incision extended along the sides of my head, resulting in a ~1-2cm wide bald strip along the sides of my head. I was not expecting the incision to extend this far back, but I suppose it makes sense. Two years out, it is clear this was not a case of shock loss and that hair is not coming back.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I believe some form of wound dehiscence occurred in the early stages of healing. A few weeks after surgery, the scar began separating, especially at the temples, &amp; a yellow goo formed (pictures are NOT for the faint of heart.) I was assured that “it is just a part of the healing process.” Eventually these parts did heal over, but at about a year out it became clear that hair was not going to grow through the trichophytic incision as expected. I am quite white passing but I am half Asian and I know that people of my ethnicity tend to keloid/hypertrophic scar.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The solution offered by Dr. Rodman’s office: “You can style / part your hair differently to mostly cover all of that,” — and while, yes I have been able to do that (still a point of contention because I do not look great with a middle part!), great pain must be taken to avoid unveiling to the world a stark bald strip. Swimming is out of the question, wind is to be avoided at all costs. This has resulted in much anxiety and depression.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Around 18 months after the surgery, I went back to Face Forward for a session of microneedling and PRP in hopes of healing the scar. It did not make matters worse, but I’m not sure it made it better at all, either, and I elected to not return for another session because it was performed so aggressively. One thing that bothered me was, in our exchanges while scheduling the microneedling session, Dr. Rodman’s office staff wrote:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“To date, all incisions will leave some type of scar &amp; this is discussed at pre op. Your incision will continue to heal, conceal &amp; subside over the years. I fully understand that is not the timetable that most would like to hear. To that point, I am also attaching some some pre op photos as a reminder for how far you have come. You look amazing &amp; many would be envious of your current results.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
To send a picture of my pre-op photos was baffling and somewhat upsetting decision, because I had repeatedly said I was very pleased with the actual surgical results, which permitted me to go stealth. I only took issue with how the incision was handled. At the time of my surgery, I had only seen favorable reviews of Dr. Rodman’s work. However, since then, I have seen a few women with the exact same scar issue as me; had I known about these cases, I would not have gone forward with Dr. Rodman.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you are a surgeon, do NOT comment below offering your services. I am currently healing from a revision which has put me $15k in debt, and I am not interested in monetarily supporting this industry any further. I am also unable to pursue legal recourse because the medmal statue of limitations in the state of Texas expires two years after date of service — in about two weeks. I am posting this simply so no one in the future makes the same mistake that I did, anonymously so not to compromise my stealth socially.

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve gone through this experience. I guess minoxidil didn&#39;t help with hair regrowth either?

Hello!
</p>
<p>
From what I understand, hair will never grow in the scars because they are widened.
</p>
<p>
As I said, I&#39;ve gotten revisions done, so fixing it is not a concern. I am just here to inform. Thanks!

I’m glad you were able to receive a revision and I’m sorry you had this experience. Thank you for sharing; it really helps others make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
Just a quick question: Did Dr Rodman outline for you beforehand the general contours of the incision? I ask only because that’s pretty far back for an incision and, if the hair loss was enough to warrant it, it seems like that should have been a discussion re: location of the scar. Thanks!

it&#39;s even further back than the picture shows, which I learned when the hair transplant doctors gave me an undercut: the scar arced down above my ear to the edge of my neck-hair-line...

This is actually what I ended up going with, so far so good!
</p>
<p>
The large amount of blood during the micro needling session made it clear that the scar tissue didn&#39;t lack vascularization
<em>
luckily
</em>
so the blood supply was good enough for grafts. :)
</p>
<p>
Still put me in extreme financial destitution though :(

That sounds like a big scar, and a bad response from the doctor. I&#39;m so sorry this happened.
</p>
<p>
Didn&#39;t there used to be a database of doctors where all this info could be stored?

So sorry that you had to go through that. Two questions if you have the time. Did you have an extreme widows peak on either side? Did you at least speak with any attorneys? It did not sound like your window had completely expired as of your posting.

Sorry for late reply. No I didn&#39;t have extreme peak. I emailed what seemed like every attorney in town and the response was mostly that before the statue of limitations expired there just wasn&#39;t enough time to put together a case, so they wouldn&#39;t take me. It&#39;s whatever, I got a raise at work so I can pay off all my debt now. Just sucks :

I am so sorry hun.  It really looks like they don&#39;t know how to reconnect skin in the scalp without causing major problems.  Its stories like this which stop me from getting FFS.  You need a really good surgeon to avoid scars.  And some leave you REALLY roughed up

I mean yeah I got all of those procedures and they turned out fine but you know they still have to make an incision to do the brow stuff. I don&#39;t want to scare you, but I hope your decision is more informed than mine was.
