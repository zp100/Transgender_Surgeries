I think this is highly individual. Also depends on the surgical method. Personally I was done with pads within a month and a half or two months or something like that. Pretty quickly. But I&#39;m not much of a bleeder so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s part of it. Also if you have granulation treated with silver nitrate it&#39;s going to cause discharge. Discharge from lube is definitely a thing but it shouldn&#39;t be so excessive that you need pads all the time.

I just kind of cleaned up as best I could w/ paper towel (toilet tissue tends to not be sturdy enough for that and can leave residue of its own). Now, 2.5 years later, I&#39;ll douche w/ warm water maybe once every two weeks or so - which is about how often I dilate nowadays.

I had same problem and I switched to liners and would bring a couple in my pocket to work and just go to the bathroom and change them about every 5 hours or sooner if I felt gross.
</p>
<p>
I still use pads for right after dilating.

Has anyone experience funny odor? I’ve been postop for 2 1/2 months going on three and I am noticing there is a funny smell coming out between the urethral and clitoris tissue. I did ask this to my register nurse who is in charge of following up on my process of my healing, however she did mention that it is normal but I wonder if anyone has experienced this. I wouldn’t  say it smells fishy but it does smell like blood mixed with urine. I noticed that there is not too much blood but it is a light color, with the combination of yellow discharge. I was told it lasts about 12 weeks and it is kind of annoying to smell it every time I have to urinate. I wonder if anyone who has got through this can tell me or break down what I can do to keep the vaginal canal and the vagina itself smelling normal as I go through this interesting time. It kind of looks like it’s pus but I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but I would douche and wash it with feminine hygiene products however I feel like no matter what I do it doesn’t go away. The doctor said I don’t have any signs of infection however it does feel overwhelming I constantly smell that every time when I have to urinate. What can I do?

Its normal. I had it as well. It went away all of a sudden on its own after it seemed to be there for what seemed like forever.

I just made sure I kept baby wipes and pads available. A perri bottle helps too!  That was huge when it came to maintenance for me!  But a fwork id go to the restroom and wipe really well, and change my pad. It seemed to be enough. I think the smell is just the discharge, as I noticed when the smell stopped my discharge seemed to change consistency and color.

Once my surgeon used silver nitrate to burn away the granulation tissue (this happened at my 6 month follow up appointment), my daily amount of discharge decreased dramatically. It was night and day. I was getting really nervous because at 6 months and still having to wear pads or changing liners every few hours...it was causing a lot of anxiety for me. I was wondering if this was the new normal.
</p>
<p>
If you have a lot of granulation tissue (the lumpy bright red tissue), make an appointment with your surgeon asap to get it removed. They cut off a piece when I was in the office but it didn&#39;t hurt at all, surprisingly. My surgeon also gave me a prescription for clobetasol that has helped clear up almost all of the remaining granulation tissue that didn&#39;t go away after the silver nitrate treatment.

I think I wore them for about 6 months but I had really bad discharge and a few infections. I mean, I still get discharge but not a lot, discharge is normal and why panties have a gusset. So if its not enough to soak through your panties just go without the pads.

Hmm ok. I never thought about that actually - maybe I should try it and see how it goes as it continues to lessen. But that is what I was hoping to hear - that it gets to that point!

Have you tried panty liners? They’re very thin, so not as much protection as a pad but enough to absorb minor discharge. I’m many years post op but still have a tiny amount of discharge especially after using lube so the panty liners come in handy to keep me feeling safe.

Yes ive been starting to wear those now since its greatly diminished - just bought a box of them yesterday. They are much better for sure. I dont think I need to go back to the actual pads at this point, but I did mean to include liners as well.

For me it was a little over a year. I had a revision to remove my remaining internal granulation a year post-op so had to continue wearing them for a bit longer from that, but after that heaIed I stopped wearing them until my second revision another year later, which was another few weeks of pads and then nothing again.
</p>
<p>
As far as lube discharge goes, I alternate between a ph balanced water-based lube (helps maintain vaginal flora) and silicone lube (helps with healing scars), using the minimum required for proper dilation, so that there isn&#39;t much discharge. I usually shower afterward anyways so that usually takes care of cleanup so I don&#39;t have to worry about any discharge, too.

Im intrigued about this lube cycling you do. Do you mind sharing what you use?  I just use McKesson surgical jelly as recommended by my surgeon but I see no issue trying what you are doing.

After surgery I used Surgilube the first few months, then I used the Mckesson brand for the rest of the first year or so cause I had so much of it from buying in 12-packs. Think I still have some sealed tubes somewhere, too.
</p>
<p>
After that I tried to find a much less messy lube so that I could dilate without as much cleanup. The gel lubes work great but you end up using a lot and they melt into a lot of discharge, so I wanted to find a water-based liquid lube instead.
</p>
<p>
I eventually found Good Clean Love BioNude, which is a bit pricey (about $13 a tube at stores around me), but it works extremely well and was exactly what I was looking for. It is even listed on the SoulSource website&#39;s Women&#39;s Health Products store page, so I guess they also recommend it? Instead of a giant glob of jelly smeared over the dilator, I just pour between a nickel and quarter sized amount carefully poured on the dilator so it doesn&#39;t drip off, and slide it in, rotating as I do to spread the lube over the dilator and cost my vagina at the same time. This stuff lasts for hours.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon also recommended that I could use silicone oil lube for much less messier dilation that I could more or less leave in place since it would be slowly absorbed and have a beneficial effect of helping reduce scars. I did some research and find that since the SoulSource dilators are made of polyurethane, some silicone lube brands would possibly damage the dilators since they use a mixture of ingredients, but not one that is pure dimethicone oil, so I bought a tiny bottle of K-Y True Feel Premium Silicone Lubricant since it is only the dimethicone oil in it. It&#39;s very pricey compared to others, but a little bit goes a loooooooooong way, I am able to dilate with a few drops or a light drizzle on the side of the dilator. This stuff also lasts for a long time, can do multiple sessions in the same day if you need to do stuff between dilations, might possibly last multiple days if not cleaned out.
</p>
<p>
I mostly use the BioNude stuff, so I&#39;ve gone through several tubes in the last 2 years, but I use the silicone oil every now and then to change things up a bit. I have only ever needed to buy the one bottle of the silicone oil lube so far since a little goes so far. I dilate a lot less these days since I am fully healed but these are my go-to&#39;s.

I&#39;m 6-7 months post-op and still wearing ultra-thin kotex liners. I tried going without them for a bit and well ughh. I stopped wearing pads pretty soon after surgery because I hated the diaper feeling.
