I&#39;m in the process of writing a full dossier on this but in the meantime your patient coordinator will answer all of your questions.

Thanks for pointing these out. I always notice the generic ones and just skip them. I&#39;ll start making note now however...

What is astroturfed, are you saying these are fake or played up reviews?

They&#39;re fake. they all follow the same format, they all have the same tropes, the biggest and most prominent and re-used being the &#34;reviewer&#34; always name drops the patient coordinator, giving them a masticatory amount of praise, and then stating that &#34;all of their questions were answered.&#34; Some of these reviews go back awhile meaning she has been using the same pattern for years.

Thank you, thats what I thought. She asked me to do a review for her back in 2019 after my surgery in 2018 and I never answered her cause I was just finding out how horrible she really is to our community.

Recently we just uncovered that if she WAS actually held accountable by the system it would effectively end all of the trans surgeries done by reputable ones. Also 4 people tried suing her for malpractice and all of them got settled out of court. Rumer knows this which is one of the reasons why she preys upon our community.
</p>
<p>
System wise however we might have an ace up our sleeve with these fake reviews of hers. I ran them by our lawyer and she has broken numerous false advertising laws which could and should be mass reported to the state AG. I&#39;m writing up a full dossier and another call to action for doing just that. This post was a trial run to see how many other tropes people could spot that I might have missed.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, community solidarity and depriving Dr. Rumer of as many new patients as possible is the key to victory. Warn your friends.
