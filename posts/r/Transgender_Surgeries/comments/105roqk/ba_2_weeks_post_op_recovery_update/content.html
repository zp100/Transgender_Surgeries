Hey all! Just wanted to provide an update.
</p>
<p>
About 2 weeks ago I had my Breast Aug with Dr Jessica Hsu from the University of Michigan Hospital, and recovery had been going well so far!
</p>
<p>
Few updates, the steri strips on my areolas have come off, and because of that my areolas are now much more puffy and protruding then they were previously. There may be a way to fix this, but I am not entirely sure how. If anyone has any experience with this, please let me know!
</p>
<p>
After my first post op appointment at the 7 day mark, I was told that recovery is going great, that I can start sleeping on my side, that I can (carefully) resume normal arm mobility, and that I can move to wearing sports bras instead of surgical bras. However, I was also told that the 5 pound weight limit restriction would be in place for another 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Regarding recovery, it has been super easy! Pain has basically been non-existent since the 5 day mark, the bruising is completely gone, and my boobs are slowly starting to soften up. They haven&#39;t started dropping a ton yet though.
</p>
<p>
One thing that I did not expect to be so bad was nipple sensitivity. My nipples are INCREDIBLY sensitive. It&#39;s to the point where I literally have irritation just from wearing a sports bra and doing nothing else. My doctor warned me about this, but I had no idea it would be this bad.
</p>
<p>
The last week has been filled with new sports bras, trying on old clothes and old sports bras (most don&#39;t fit anymore), and seeing what new clothes I can actually pull off now that I have boobs! Overall, it&#39;s been an incredible experience and I highly recommend BA and my surgeon to anyone interested.
</p>

They make lanolin cream intended for breastfeeding folks that can help w/ nipple irritation provided you are not allergic to it (patch test it elsewhere before using it.)
</p>
<p>
It helped me a lot w/ post-chest surgery nipple irritation &amp; runners nipple.

Oh! Cool! I haven&#39;t heard of that but I&#39;ll definitely check it out. Is it over the counter or do you need a prescription?
</p>
<p>
Also, when did you start applying scar cream to your incisions?

It’s over the counter. Search for “lanolin breast cream”
</p>
<p>
I did not have the exact same kind of chest surgery as you so I’d recommend reaching out to your surgeon to confirm. Generally, most sources say it’s okay to do once there is no more scabbing and the area is fully closed. Most people use either scar strips or silicone gel, and massage regularly. I personally used silicone scar gel, but I also tend to scar very minimally, so ymmv.

For sure! Best of luck - I know firsthand how hard it can be to kick the cycle of nipple irritation. (Since they swell, so they get irritated, which makes them swell, and then they crack, and swell…) so I hope you can ‘nip it in the bud’ faster than it took me hah.

Congratulations on your success. Dunno if this might interest you, but if you run out of scar cream, fresh onions have some of the same substance. You look TERRIFIC, Girl!!

Sure thing. It sounds nutty...doesn&#39;t it? ....but I researched it....and a scar on my face...and another on my L knee...are almost completely gone (partly from the cream...and partly just from a slice of onion)!!  ;  )
</p>
<p>
And, I &#34;took another look&#34; at this topic (about a year ago)...cuz I&#39;ll probably have the &#34;insert from the bottom&#34; breast procedure...and would like to minimize any scarring below...which is pretty common, I hear.
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;re doing JUST splendidly my Dear!!! You seem like a nice young woman.

Thanks for the nice reply. I&#39;m a doctor...and I suspect that this is a VERY temporary PROBLEM. ...and especially as you recover from the stress of the surgery. And, I&#39;m happy for you...to have had such a talented surgeon. It must feel GREAT!!

I had similar issues with my nipples after surgery. Mine were actually numb for a long time after surgery so I can&#39;t comment on the sensitivity, but they were very pointy. They went back to normal eventually. It was like a gradual relaxation over the course of a couple weeks.

Thanks for sharing your experience! I really hope that mine will relax eventually. They&#39;ve been pretty pointy for awhile, way before BA.

They look great!  I assume it was under muscle, since you have a5lb limit. Do you have any before pics? I have a consult on Jan 19th but I have very little breast development over the past 19 months of hrt.

It kinda just happened! I&#39;ve been on hrt for 5 years. I started progesterone between 3 and 6 months after starting hrt, then switched to injections for estrogen at about 1 year and 3 months.

My biggest theory (other than genetics) is progesterone cycling. Since going on injections, I have been really bad at taking progesterone consistently. I estimate I probably take it 60% of the time, and sometimes I miss multiple days in a row. Obviously, ymmv but good luck!
