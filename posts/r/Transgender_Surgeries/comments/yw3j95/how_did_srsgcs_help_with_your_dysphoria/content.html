So for the longest time I&#39;ve wanted to get surgery, and at this point, bottom stuff is one of the last remaining sources of dysphoria. But recently, the feeling that it won&#39;t fix that dysphoria has been creeping up, and that I&#39;ll feel that it isn&#39;t a &#34;real&#34; vagina. So I wanted to ask anyond here who&#39;s had the surgery: How much did it help with dysphoria? Thanks

It helped me a lot. I feel more confident and it‚Äôs great to just throw on sweats with no worries about being clocked or having to tuck anything.

It completely, 100% eliminated my bottom dysphoria and made more of a mental difference to me and how I felt about myself than I could have imagined. Everything feels like it always should have been, I feel comfortable with sex for the first time in my life, and clothes fit the way they should without any tucking. Legit isn&#39;t a day that goes by im not thankful for it and having had BA and FFS as well, bottom surgery for me had the biggest impact (that would be a totally subjective thing though). Would go through the recovery gladly again for the results.

I&#39;m a lot less self conscious about my clothing, pants especially. I also don&#39;t feel the need to always wear longer tops to cover my crotch. Still not up to showing midriff, but it&#39;s a huge improvement. It also helped me correct my posture since I&#39;m not as worried about my tops covering my crotch.

So i wasnt sure on srs, like 90% but felt stuck, i wasnt moving forward and wanted to just move on and get on with life.
</p>
<p>
Had srs a few months ago, and it was only afterwards did i realise how much dysphoria i had actually had pre srs.
</p>
<p>
Im still early days, but result wise once healed i dont think anyone will be able to tell, even a gynocologist‚Ä¶.

It helped more with dysphoria than I expected. Mainly because after I healed I didn‚Äôt think about my genitals anymore. I could wear what I wanted to wear and cross my legs and didn‚Äôt think about tucking. It feels like a real vagina to me, I have a clit that‚Äôs very sensitive and a canal I can insert things into. It‚Äôs been 3 years now and my vagina feels like it‚Äôs always been there. So overall I would say it helped with my dysphoria quite a bit.

Totally echo the &#39;always been there&#39; type feeling a little over 2 years post op. Crazy how quick the old setup seems hard to remember/almost silly to think about (just weird to have such a big shift after living like that for 34 years first).

For context I‚Äôm older (42) and questioned if I needed the ‚Äúcomplete conversion‚Äù heck I made it this long.  So I started small with an orchiectomy this spring and loved the results so much I have my SRS consultation scheduled for next year for PI vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Your right it won‚Äôt be a cis vagina and online forums will debate endlessly on the validity of my results.  I can‚Äôt change those realities but I know SRS is right for me and I look forward to the results.

Hmmmm...
</p>
<p>
It freed me of all inhibitions. I no longer feel self-conscious when men pull me close. Nor do I any longer have any compunctions about getting naked with them, or touched by them.
</p>
<p>
Sex feels right and natural for the first time in my life. I don&#39;t need to make excuses when invited to the public baths. And I feel physically right.
</p>
<p>
I now also feel I have a place in society, and am not just a guest or onlooker. It is something I don&#39;t remember ever truly feeling since the date I was told I was a boy.

Well, for starters it got rid of thoughts like, &#34;If I have to have these gross genitals and can&#39;t get GCS, I might as well walk into traffic so the rest of my body is mutilated to match&#34;. So those thoughts being gone is already a big plus.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, there hasn&#39;t been a day where I regret surgery or wish I could go back. I barely remember what it was like to have my pre-op genitals, and I&#39;m still surprised that I went 30+ years with the wrong genitals before getting that corrected.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t get a burst of euphoria or happiness, but the dysphoria sure went away! Things just feel &#34;right&#34; now.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never worried about &#34;how is a neovagina different from a natal vagina&#34;, so I can&#39;t really relate to that thought process and how it changes post-op.

It&#39;s a complex question to answer, because by the time I got surgery my transition had already progressed in other ways to a point that my dysphoria was not particularly overwhelming most of the time. After the surgery, however, I can say that it really improved a great deal about the physical experience of sex for me -- I can say confidently that for me at least I feel like it&#39;s a &#34;real&#34; vagina and don&#39;t experience any of the disconnect I used to feel in that department, even though I only went with a partial-depth procedure. It&#39;s also really great to be able to look at myself in the mirror and not see anything out of place, not have to tuck or anything like that. I don&#39;t think much about it on a daily basis, but in a vague, general sort of way it has improved the emotional background noise of my life.

I agree with what others have posted.  I will add that I just feel more relaxed about everything in my life in a way that I didn&#39;t before.

I have doubts about it , like everyone else but in my case I was more concerned about the risk and recovery . My husband helped me a lot to decide what was best for me at the end I have the surgery and two years later is the best decision I have made no regrets at all, dysphoria ? Who is she ? I don‚Äôt even know her!!!!!!

Hellooo having done the Grs or Srs has helped me a lot in my dysphoria also because since I started my transition my goal was to feel like a normal girl only that with that bulky thing between my legs I felt uncomfortable with my boyfriend then and I still dreamed of being able to have normal sexual intercourse, i.e. vaginal penetration and not anal sex, which I never wanted to do, and therefore even the only first important operation such as orcheotomy, an operation done after about 12 months of hrt, i.e. the removal of the testicles to which I underwent on the advice of both my gynecologist and the surgeon, who then gave me the Srs has already helped me a lot as I was finally able to avoid tucking the penis with adhesives or other and I was also able to start wearing tighter and more feminine trousers and above all shorts and a bikini and then when I was finally able to do the Srs 8/10 months after the orcheotomy I really felt complete as I finally saw my dream of having a vagina and then finally feeling totally normal...... and then the first time I saw her and especially was able to touch her I felt like a jolt that ni went through the body and above all I was able to experience the first real orgasm ....... since then that is for just over a year now I feel perfectly normal and happy byeeeee

Sinai asks you to rate your before/after genital dysphoria, 0 to 10. mine was a 9, now its a 0. I have 0 concerns about the appearance of my vagina. i am confident no one would &#39;clock&#39; it, and it functions exactly as I&#39;d expect. I am a poster child for &#39;go for it&#39;.

You can&#39;t use my experience as any sort of barometer as I had mild dysphoria and Im demi. I opted for vaginaplasty with penial preservation. I&#39;m certainly happier now but my choice is extremely an individual one. A road less travelled.
