Had a Tracheal shave with Dr Chettawut (Post 1 month). Healing well according to the doctor but my voice is kinda bad (hoarse voice) and its hard to tune to a louder voice, is it normal? How long will it take for my voice back to normal? And what food should I avoid?

I forgot to mentioned this is actually my second time doing tracheal shave surgery. The first one healed pretty well but people were still be able to see the bump, so I did a second time last month.
</p>
<p>
My voice isn&#39;t too horse but it is abit hard to tune to a softer feminine voice right now.
</p>
<p>
And he did told me he will avoid shaving too close to the vocal cord before the surgery.

Sorry I can&#39;t give you advice, but I&#39;m at the cross roads of getting a Tracheal shave.  I don&#39;t know if f it is worth it.  Mine doesn&#39;t stand out and I&#39;m scare of getting a even deeper voice.
</p>
<p>
I hope the good healing continues.
