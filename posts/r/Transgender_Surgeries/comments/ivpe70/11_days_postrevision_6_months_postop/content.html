Just to let you know, I was the very first patient of Dr Schaff in that new clinic, and perhaps staff was learning on my example. And that could be the reason for slight imperfections. I want you to know that I&#39;m very proud of that fact, and I&#39;m glad I paved the way for the next patients after me. I&#39;m pretty sure those after me will have even better results üòâ and I really hope you will, because I love you all ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I just wanted to assure you that I have no personal interest in advertising the surgeon or the clinic.
</p>
<p>
The sole purpose of my post is to provide you with the best information I have, that I wasn&#39;t able to find before my own surgery.
</p>
<p>
I want you to know that I do care about my community, and specifically my transgender friends who are seeking genital reconstruction surgery, and the least I can do is to share my experience and pictures.
</p>
<p>
I really hope my post doesn&#39;t offend anyone&#39;s feelings.

Hey, I&#39;m curious. About how long was the waiting time for the surgeries? I think with him changing clinics and everything the waiting times shifted a bit.

I can&#39;t tell you how much time you&#39;d need to wait if you contacted Dr Schaff office today. I think now he&#39;s very busy. I was lucky to be his first patient in Klinik Sanssouci, so the only waited five months for Dr Schaff to setup everything.

Yeah, me too. Day after surgery I had great sensation in my inner vulva, and now over week after outer vulva is in some pain. Yeah, that&#39;s normal. Initially the  incision site is numb and then as it heals pain comes and overshadows all sensation. Hoping all eases in next few weeks üòâ

I put lots of Ovestin on the incision sites and that dramatically speed up the wound healing, but next day I had crazy hot flashes üò± although nothing to be too worried about. They resolved within two days üòâ

Is this a penile inversion GRS? Looks like theres a lot of fluid around your labia minora.

No, it is combined method. My surgeon site
<a href="http://drschaff.de">http://drschaff.de</a>
</p>
<p>
My labia look shiny because of the cream I put to speed up the healing. The natural lubrication exists inside vagina and in vestibule. However, since it&#39;s natural and highly depends on bacterial flora I&#39;ve lost it completely during revision due to antibiotics. Now I&#39;m off antibiotics and flora is slowly coming back. I&#39;m also bit dehydrated and that has an impact. Nevertheless I can insert my dilator 16cm in barely moisting the entrance with my saliva.

There is differences though. Dr Schaff preserves practically every source part which makes vulva and vagina resemble closely cisgender counterpart. Here&#39;s list of features: - Realistic (identical to cisgender anatomy) appearance of vulva (labia majora, labia minora, interlabial sulci, mons pubis, Fourchette)  - Vestibule (hood, clitoris, inner surfaces of labia minora, meatus, entrance) is very sensitive and erogenic and produces mucus (self lubricates) - Vagina has urethral lining, and it produces mucus, maintains typical female bacterial flora (self lubricates), and has erogenic sensitivity
</p>
<p>
Now, above features are theoretical and on my picture you can see some imperfections, but it will differ from patient to patient. The self lubrication is very fragile. When I&#39;m healthy and not dehydrated, then it&#39;s all good, otherwise it gets sticky. Just to note that during sex with a guy without using a condom my vagina became extremely wet, and Cunnilingus feels amazing, not from this world.

Forgot, and it&#39;s quite very important: - Kegel muscles are there and functional! - Vulva-vaginal erections!
</p>
<p>
The spongious muscles are preserved. You can control contractions during sexual intercourse and have more fun this way. During climax they really contract. During arousal Vulva and Vagina get &#34;hard&#34; (erected) same as cisgender counterpart would do.

Traditional PI is just penile skin stretched above its limits damaging dorsal nerves (yup, bye bye orgasms) to form vagina. In the old school PI they didn&#39;t even create clitoris, and later they used small piece removed from glans to create one.
</p>
<p>
Then you have penoscrotal flap method, in which penile skin isn&#39;t that stretched, because scrotal skin is appended to create more depth.
</p>
<p>
Then you&#39;ve got Dr Suporn method, which extended penoscrotal flap with beautiful, realistic vulva. The inner surface of labia minora is made of penile foreskin (aka prepuce). He still used small part of glans to create clitoris, but he also added frenulum of clitoris made of penile frenulum. The clitoral hood in this method is made of penile skin.
</p>
<p>
And finally Dr Schaff unique method (that only Dr Schaff and few other German surgeon do) seems like a variation of Dr Suporn method, however there are significant differences: - whole area of penile foreskin together with glans (not disconnected in any way) is used to create inner surface of labia minora, clitoral hood, clitoris. This gives a lot of sensation (20k nerves are preserved as opposed to 300 in PI methods)  - vestibule is created from the above connected with diamond shaped meatus created by splitting urethra in very Dr Schaff special way. There is additional erogenic sensation in that area too.  - vagina entrance (introitus) is created from penile skin and inner surface of urethra (opened using Dr Schaff special way). There is additional erogenic sensation in that area too.  - interior vaginal canal is created from inner surface of urethra (continued from introitus) and scrotal skin prepared in some Dr Schaff special way to guarantee good depth. There is additional erogenic sensation in that area too.  - spongy muscles are preserved so that labia majora and introitus erect during arousal (same as cisgender counterpart). This make it more fun to play with your partner and if you train to control contractions, then you get better orgasms.

I don&#39;t know what is called PI these days. I&#39;ve seen some picture it was claiming to be PI, but to me it looked more like Dr Suporn method.

Dr. Schaff told me during my consult he makes his vaginas with more sensation but similar looking to cisvagina&#39;s. Not exactly looking. He makes a comprimise between sensation and estathics.

No, it&#39;s not peritoneal pull-through. Combined method has been developed by Dr Schaff. Please, visit the website (above). You can use Google translate. Basically it seems like it&#39;s based on Dr Suporn method plus urethral lining (see my older post for details)

It&#39;s still healing so incision sites are reddish. It may look pink because of strong light. The tissue used is pinkish (prepuce/foreskin of the penis is usually pink), labia majora are skin colored.

Ohh it&#39;s hard to find results for most german surgeons. I have my first appointment on Friday with Dr. Schaff.
</p>
<p>
Still a while until I can get the actual surgery, but excited nonetheless.

Not much, and yet a lot. Basically it was vulvoplasty. We didn&#39;t touch anything inside my vagina. Dr removed some skin and shaped my vulva to look more symmetrical and just that makes big difference in appearance.

Looks beautiful! Congratulations. Do you know where one could find other photo results from Dr Schaff? I&#39;m just starting research on potential future surgeons and I&#39;d like to learn more about him and his results. Also do you know if he/his staff/clinic speak English? And how long does it typically take to get a consultation and then a surgery date? Thanks!

Unfortunately there is no official gallery, because I think German law does not allow surgeon&#39;s to publish images of vulva. Dr Schaff will show you few other images when you see him for consultation.
</p>
<p>
Dr Schaff and assistant doctors in the Klinik Sanssouci do speak English. Also they give you paper to sign if you wanted to avail of the translator. I think translator service is free and it is required by German law for them to provide it.
</p>
<p>
Potsdam is beautiful place, and full of tourists, so people speak English. It is good to know some basics of German language when you travel there so you enjoy more your stay.
</p>
<p>
My situation was little different. As people noticed, Dr Schaff has moved out from PSC Munich, and now he works with Lubos Klinik in Munich and Klinik Sanssouci in Potsdam. Dr Schaff decided to put me as first patient in Klinik Sanssouci, so from my initial consultation in October 2019 to my operation in March 2020 I only waited 6 months. I don&#39;t know what is his current waiting period. And I know is that recently he is really busy.
