The labia sticks together during the day so just wanted to include the “this is what it looks like when you rip the panties off” shot
</p>
<p>
I can orgasm and have solid sensation, I stopped dilating about two years ago because I decided depth wasn’t important to me. I maintain the ability to finger myself and be fingered by others fairly vigorously and can stretch enough to hold stuff inside fairly quickly (10-20 mins and my strapless strapon is good enough)
</p>
<p>
Sensation is mostly from the clit and nerves are most accessible to hands and mouth stuff (my preference). Penetration feels okay but only really feels good when it’s upward pressure (rubbing the underside of my clit)
</p>
<p>
The recovery for the vaginoplasty was horrendous, mostly due to surrounding drug use and psychological issues. The Labiaplasty was a cakewalk comparatively even though I was told the pain would be MORE (it was 10-15x less IME).

Thank you so much for sharing all this! This is information I have been wondering and was going to figure out how to ask, maybe my support group, I don&#39;t know. But thanks! I&#39;ll probably still be asking others of course but very helpful.
</p>
<p>
Do you mind if I ask, are your orgasms completely different than before? As in strength, satisfaction, ease to get there...

<p>
Orgasms are different and I experience them differently especially masturbation, which is like a smaller thing usually. Small peak and done.
</p>
<p>
Now it can be more a sustained kind of peak for a bit before I just kind of hit a stimulation wall!-‘d slow down. Although that’s usually only with other people.
</p>
<p>
It took a good year to two for me have to satisfying orgasms but I know people who figured it out earlier. Even recently it’s getting better from just being more mindful and communicating with partners.

I&#39;m too afraid to ask because I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s appropriate but was the sensation better when you had a penis?
</p>
<p>
I am afraid I&#39;m going to miss the penis if I get the surgery.

Yea, the Labiaplasty happened about six months after the vaginoplasty (Vag was June, Labia was Jan)

Can I ask who did the labiabplasty later on?  And do you have comparison shots of the labia prior?  I have a lot of labia skin that I feel can be cleaned up much nicer once my revision has healed.

Meltzer did the labiaplasty as well. Unfortunately I don’t have a comparison shot

I’m happy I got the labiaplasty

Simply amazing. I have a few questions since you offered.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How much depth do you think you lost since you stopped dilating ?
</li>
<li>
Did you have hair removal before your SRS?
</li>
<li>
What made you choose Meltzer?
</li>
<li>
Would you recommend him?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The last question I&#39;d like to frame based on my situation. I feel quite indifferent about my junk. At times I feel dysphoric, especially having sex and have to imagine I&#39;m the one being penetrated. I get tired of tucking and fearing the bulge appearing at inopportune moments.  Even with all these reasons to move forward with SRS, I don&#39;t feel a compulsion to do so. Perhaps in time it will become obvious but right now I&#39;m just stuck in the thoughts.
</p>
<p>
So the question for you is, was the drive to get SRS such that you were convinced that it was the right thing to do? What were your deciding factors?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

I had like 6~ inches before I stopped. Now it’s about 1-2 (finger up to the knuckle, wider objects don’t go very deep). I’ve read I can regain it if I resume dilating, but I haven’t really tried, I just notice anecdotally that I can gain and lose depth depending on how much I am trying to do penetrative things
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes, Meltzer requires it afaik. I had I wanna say 5/6 full electrolysis clears. I still had some internal growth but it’s almost entirely gone at this point.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He’s been doing this for a huge ass time. Even his competitors recommend him as having the most natal looking vaginas with no loss of sensitivity. The only drawback for him is total achievable depth, the technique that uses the intestine can get more depth.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Yes, I would recommend him for bottom surgery 100%. I’d also recommend Marcy Bowers, I’ve known two people who went with her who are pleased with their results.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think at the time it just seemed like “the correct thing to do to achieve transition”. I didn’t have a lot of articulation about it other than “achieve girl”. I just wanted it.

Even in the 90s Dr meltzer wasn&#39;t on the cheap side and I was never really a fan of his work back then either so I can understand how there&#39;s complications as far as things sticking in what not so that looks bad it just I don&#39;t know I always had an issue with the results just why I never looked at going to him especially seeing how and 98 he was charging 40 Grand for us two stage operation first Dr Bowers who was doing Wednesday at the time

A little bit better than mine in 1997 when he was in Portland.
</p>
<p>
Mine ended up at 4.75&#34; and 1.5&#34; wide with a little more width with an anatomical type of dilator than the 4th smooth Lexan.
</p>
<p>
After it is 100% healed it will always stretch out again with a little work.

If I’m seriously aroused I get wet enough to be fingered. It definitely happens. It’s not enough for penetration beyond fingering and even then if I have lube in reach I prefer to use it
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t close any more than your ear canal collapses in on itself. Dilate during the healing process until the skin is fully healed (1-2 years).

Sorry I forgot to answer this at the time. Meltzer’s documentation says specifically that penetrative sex will not substitute for dilation. IME it helps stretch but penetration isn’t dilation, dilation is this long consistent push which actually stretches the skin, penetration usually involves more movement which doesn’t stretch the skin long term
