I&#39;m so confused about that because the doctor seems to think that there is no hyper granulation

Dr. K and/or Ashley will tell you if it is hypergranulation - and address it.
</p>
<p>
At my 6 month follow-up I mentioned that I felt like I had some hypergranulation due to some bleeding with dilation and pain in certain areas.  When he did the exam he confirmed that i did indeed have a few places with it, and did a silver nitrate treatment right then.   I go back in a couple of weeks (a bit over 7 months out at that point) to get checked again and treat any lingering hot spots.
</p>
<p>
I am not a doctor, but I agree that it doesn&#39;t look like you have any (visible) hypergranulation.  It looks to me more like some of the urethral tissue he uses to line the labia with.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I would say it is a good result and if you are happy with how things are progressing that is what matters.ðŸ’œ
