So it&#39;s been awhile but I have an update on this. General information: I had surgery with Keelee Macphee over five months ago. It mostly went well but due to a bit of excess protrusion of my clit/unsatisfactory clithood I&#39;m looking into a minor revision, particularly one that focuses on giving me a more defined, rounder majora. I&#39;ve been intending to post an update on this but was waiting for the quote below. I will be looking into getting the revision done in November sometime.
</p>
<p>
The consult went well, and the general consensus from my surgeon was that it would likely have to be done in a two step procedure in order to achieve the result I&#39;m looking for. She didn&#39;t tell me outright that anything I was asking for was impossible, but it may be difficult, especially since I am as lean as I am. I&#39;ve got several post-op visits until the revision, so it&#39;s likely there will be some on going strategizing on how to proceed, especially as I continue to heal from the initial operation, and think up more questions to ask.
</p>
<p>
The clithood and clit positioning would be partly fixed in an office visit under local anesthesia, and would be at no cost. I&#39;m then looking at about six weeks of healing before another trip to the OR to address the labia majora, do the rest of the clithood, and alter the minora. The quote I got for this lists the procedure as a liposuction fat transfer from belly and thighs to the vulva, and has a cost break down of the following:
</p>
<p>
Payment by credit:             Payment by cash, check, or debit:
</p>
<p>
Surgeon Fee:        4,200.00                        4,000.00
</p>
<p>
Anesthesia Fee:    1,877.99                        1,877.99
</p>
<p>
Facility Fee:          2,935.60                        2,935.60
</p>
<p>
Total Estimate:      9,013.59                       8,813.59
</p>
<p>
I admit I&#39;m liiiiiiittle disappointed it&#39;s that high, but honestly it seems in line with all my other trips to the OR thus far. I am considering comboing it with BA to make better use of the facility fee/anesthesia since it would be cheaper to get them done at the same time. It looks like the estimate time for the second step of the revision is 3-hours. Feel free to ask me anything.

What will they be doing to help solve the clitoris protrusion? Ive had multiple consults for that and each told me the only thing they could do is to look for any tissue that could be pushing it forward, and then tacking it down tighter with sutures, and hope that it holds and doesn&#39;t pop back out.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
And what is the plan for the hood? in conjunction with the clitoris changes especially.
</p>
<p>

<p>
I dont know if youve looked into it, but insurances will usually cover revisions if they&#39;re dysphoria-inducing, which I imagine clitoris-related things often are. If you are able to get an insurance that covers trans surgeries to begin with, that is.

Insurance won&#39;t cover anything for me. Ive tried, Ive got the infamous nc state health plan, funded by our lovely state treasurer. The same state treasurer who has claimed he won&#39;t allow coverage until forced to by the courts. It won&#39;t even cover hrt unless flagged as an endocrine disorder.
</p>
<p>
I believe the fix to the clit protruding is to tack it down with sutures but ill be asking for more details at my next postop in September. I need to clarify how I want it positioned anyways. As for the hood, the plan is to change the shape of it a little and add creases on either side. this will largely have to be done in the OR portion, so still strategizing it.
</p>
<p>
Last visit was a little pressed for time due to how many topics I had to address, so it is largely an on going situation.

thanks! yeah, it seems the tack down thing is really the only common solution. I keep looking around for solutions that can get it back a bit more than that would be able to. I&#39;ll definitely post on this reddit if i ever find one. to me, it seems like people who have issues with protrusion often need more mm setback than tacking down can give. plus, at least one of the surgeons i consulted with said theres a risk tacking down won&#39;t hold.
</p>
<p>
And yeah. Sorry about the insurance. im in a southern state too, and the insurance reps make it really difficult to get even though its in my benefits. some are amazing and helpful, but some just won&#39;t help or will give incorrect information when they figure out its for a trans surgery.

If you find anything let me know. I&#39;ll try to remember to send you an update if I learn anything new in the post-op in September. I&#39;ll likely not be doing the office visit portion to correct the clit until after my vacation in October, so still plenty of time to strategize on that front.
