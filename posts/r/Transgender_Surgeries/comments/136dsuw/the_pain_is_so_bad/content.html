Sorry ur going thru pain,  it&#39;s up to the drs to provide u with pain meds in order to be comfortable,  I went to v Thailand to have mine done and they put me on a Morphine drip for 3 days,  after that I felt no pain and Tylenol was used . I&#39;m sorry ur going thru that I cant imagine.  U have to advocate for urself , they take an oath to do no harm.  Sounds like they are doing u harm.  Good luck and congrats girl. Happy rebirth!!

Going to second the morphine drip. That fixed my pain, just don&#39;t overdo it (n&amp;v).
</p>
<p>
I also had a spinal block pre-surgery, so if you didn&#39;t have that, it could be that the nerve itself got irritated during surgery. It could also be something pressing on the nerve. Have the doctor check you out and tell them what exactly the pain feels like.
</p>
<p>
I was alright in the hospital, but a few days later, I kept getting these occasional &#34;electric&#34; painful nerve twinges -- only lasted a couple weeks and wasn&#39;t a huge deal overall.

They won&#39;t let me have a morphine drip. They said the doctor isn&#39;t allowed to prescribe it.

Not sure which doctor isn&#39;t allowed, but the one who &#34;is&#34; is clearly incompetent. This is absolutely the kind of major surgery where morphine would be indicated.

What can I do about it though? I tell them I&#39;m in pain and they just shrug and walk away, or tell me to wait until the next time they can give me pills. I feel powerless

This doesn&#39;t seem to be a typical occurrence. That said, morphine is very addictive, and I&#39;m not sure if those doses they&#39;re giving you of other drugs is super high or not.
</p>
<p>
That said, they should most certainly be looking into why they aren&#39;t working.

There&#39;s a limit to the amount of drugs, especially codeine related ones, that they can give you at one time. It&#39;s possible you&#39;ll need to wait until some leaves your system before they can try something else. I know people keep saying you should just keep getting stuff until you are no longer in pain, but there really are limits. Once they crack what works for you, it&#39;ll be better - and every hour that passes will be  closer to it not hurting too. Sorry you are hurting so much but they just can&#39;t keep slamming you full of opioids until you get respiratory issues.

I mean, 4mg of hydromorphone isn&#39;t really that much. Nor any of the other dosages.
</p>
<p>
I asked for buprenorphine or a morphine drip, so we&#39;ll see what happens.

Thanks!

Hydrocodone or hydromorphone? 4 mg hydromorphone is a lot (because it’s such a powerful drug). Hydromorphone is actually stronger than morphine

It seems like all the pain meds you’ve been given are opioids. Maybe ask about other classes of drugs like NSAIDs? For example toradol/ketorolac

I don&#39;t think bim allowed NSAIDs because of bleeding risk.
</p>
<p>
They gave me benedril + hydromorphone. It&#39;s really sedating which is good because bc didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night.

I’m not sure why, but I think Celebrex has a lower bleeding risk? In any case I wasn’t allowed NSAIDs for 14 days after my top surgery, except for Celebrex the first 5 days.

Do you have an especially high tolerance?  Those are some strong drugs.  I wonder if a nerve blocking drug like gabapentin would help.  I had that recently for sinus surgery in combo with opioids.

unfortunately there&#39;s a limit to how many drugs you can tolerate at once, particularly opiods which seems to be the drug class you&#39;re getting. They&#39;re also usually respiratory depressants, they can fuck with your ability to breathe quite severely.
</p>
<p>
I had the same issue after top surgery, which is a less sensitive area but nonetheless one that&#39;s tugged and moved a lot whenever you do anything. I don&#39;t react to Novacane or ibuprofen, and that&#39;s all they had (and oxycodone (oxycontin), which actually worked, but they didn&#39;t wanna give me more of that bc I have the tendency to wobble a little after getting up, and they interpreted this as &#34;reacts too much to the drug&#34;)
</p>
<p>
Hang in there, you&#39;ll get through it!! It&#39;ll probably be better in a few days, every day you&#39;re gonna get closer to being pain free again. It stinks and the post surgery depression is hideous (the nurses had to force me to go outside lol), particularly combined with not really being able to shower, but you&#39;ll get through it. Crying helps sometimes, too.

Heya, it WILL get better. First couple days are the worst.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Now, here&#39;s something to consider (with good news): For a small fraction of people, opiate painkillers simply don&#39;t work for some reason. If all three of those did zilch, it might be that you are part of that group. Bonus points if you have red hair, there&#39;s a correlation there for some inexplicable reason. Talk to them about trying a non-opiate regimen.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Below is personal opinion as a non-doctor, but someone trying to become one, who has done lots of research because nerd.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I see someone else suggested Celebrex, which is an option but post-surgery it risks bleeding problems, and it also interacts badly with antidepressants if that&#39;s relevant for you. It&#39;s also deemed to be weak-ish compared to a lot of other options. I&#39;d be hesitant.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Diclofenac, Meloxicam, Indometacin, Ketoprofen are all valid NSAIDs that provide strong relief in a non-opiate format. All come with various risks so your health should be considered (EG, history of stomach problems? No diclofenac!) I also do not know if GRS-M has any of those in house or if there&#39;d be a delay.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
For whatever it&#39;s worth, I have epic chronic pain and when I went through I also had no relief from the opiates, but the Meloxicam I brought with for my chronic pain cut it by a solid 80%. Topped that up with good old over-the-counter Tylenol for about a month and it did the job for me.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Good luck!

I know opioids work for me because I use them for my migraines and they work great. Im just in so much pain that it can&#39;t really touch it.
</p>
<p>
Right now the hydromorphone is actually doing something, which is good. But it took 3 doses to get me here

Well, that then goes back to &#34;it will get better.&#34; It might be in staggering steps where it seems to stall and then all of a sudden gets way better, or it may be slow n steady, but it WILL get easier. First few days are the worst.

I had the same pain level. The nurses seemed like they didnt believe me. I was irritable for the whole stay in thr clinic. And during my recovery. Hang on there. I&#39;m already on my 7th month and i&#39;m loving it. You will be the same as where I am now. Things will heal quickly as soon as you hit your 2nd month. And days gets quicker and quicker after. 🥰😊❤️

I’m sorry you’re having a rough time, it’s not an easy process and figuring out pain meds can be difficult.
</p>
<p>
After a lot of trial and error, I found that dilaudid immediately stopped the pain and let me sleep a full night. I’d ask them about it.

I had nightmare pain for the first 24 hours after. They finally controlled it with a cocktail of OxyContin, dilaudid, and a muscle relaxer for my bladder spasms. The catheter is hell.
</p>
<p>
Stay strong, sister. It gets better. By the time Inleft the hospital five days after surgery, I never needed anything stronger than steady doses of ibuprofen. You’ll get there.

Unfortunately a lot of providers look to, &#34;relieve&#34; pain vs eliminate pain. If they believe you are surviving with what they&#39;re giving you, they typically don&#39;t find the motivation to find more alternatives as it&#39;s considered, &#34;good enough.&#34; They also have a nasty habit of not trusting women&#39;s pain. I hope they get you on something better, faster! Congratulations though! Get well soon!

Yeahm I told them the hydromorphone brought me down from a 10/10 to a 7/10, and I think they think it&#39;s good enough. But they told me they just can&#39;t give me anything stronger because the doctor isn&#39;t allowed to prescribe a morphine drip or a buprenorphine shot.

I was given Morphine. My pain was like 2-3 occasionally spiking to a 6/10. By day 3, I stopped the narcotics. My nurses had orders to continue the Morphine, but I didn&#39;t need it.  Acetaminophen was handling the pain just fine by then. I&#39;m very happy for you getting your surgery,  but I&#39;m so sorry you are in such pain. It will get better. Hope relief comes soon.

Some doctors, like mine, are administering a long-lasting nerve block during surgery and also is prescribing Gabapentin, which in my case has caused some loss of taste but also has nerve-blocking properties. I had 2 halves of an oxy pill and some pain, like you’d have with a cut or some road rash. I have been alternating ibprophin 600mg and Tylenol 500mg. But that’s about it. Different people have different pain responses of course. I hope things get better for you.

So they finally found something that helped, and told me that they had more ready for 11pm. I fell asleep, and woke up at 12:30am because of the pain, and the night nurse is refusing to give me anything for the pain. She said &#34;I am your nurse now and I can&#39;t do that. How can I help your pain?&#34; I said &#34;hydromorphone shot&#34; and she said &#34;I&#39;m not going to do that&#34;. it&#39;s in my file that nothing else has worked and she insists that I can&#39;t have anything during the night. When I do all the healing. When I haven&#39;t been sleeping because of pain she insists I don&#39;t we&#39;d pain meds. I can&#39;t believe this.

There is probably a limit to how much they can give you in so many hours.
</p>
<p>
The pain you describe may be a good sign,  it could be that you have good sensation in your clitoris and its currently being held in place with several sutures. The pressure you feel inside will reduce over the next few days as well and it will be a huge relief when the packing is removed im sure.
</p>
<p>
I understand how painful it can be especially in the evening when trying to sleep. Strong sleeping pills were the only thing that got me through it, 7mg Zopiclone, maybe that will help x
</p>
<p>
You can get through this xx
