Lots have happened in the past 3 day so I wanted to document more of it.  This is a pretty detailed account of my experience, its a long read but I hope this will help someone.  I have anxiety issues so going into things knowing as much as I can about what will happen and in what order helps me a lot.  If I left anything out or you want me to add anything let me know in the comments :)
</p>

Heres a link to my first post with what things looked like just after surgery:

CW for panic attack in day 2 section.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 1:
</strong>
I got to the hospital at 5:45am on July 2nd and waited in the waiting room on the ground floor.  Eventually they called me in to process me where I gave them the same info I&#39;ve given everyone 100 times already and  got a binder and my hospital bracelet.  After processing they sent me to the second floor to get prepped.  Several people asked me questions, they gave me a bag for my belongings, and they got me changed into my hospital gown.  They asked me about my diet, the anesthesiologist talked to me, and Bella came over with some final paperwork and went over everything one last time.  I waited a bit more and around 7:30 headed over to the OR.  I walked to the OR which was strange, usually hospitals put you in a wheelchair.  I was oddly calm during all of this considering I have a lot of anxiety issues.
</p>
<p>
We got to the OR and they had me get on the table and started hooking various things up to me for monitoring as well as the IV and pneumatic compression things for my legs.  I just call them leg squeezers. (They help prevent blood clots.)  I was a bit dehydrated from not having consumed anything since the day before so they had some trouble finding my veins for the IV, but ultimately he got it.  I was even feeling good enough to make some jokes as they hooked me up.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll spare you the eye rolls.
</p>
<p>
In what seemed like no time at all, I woke up.  I was pretty groggy.  I was in the recovery area on the second floor, which is also where they prepped me earlier.  A nurse was right near me when I woke up and let me know that surgery was over and went well.  He told me they were prepping a room for me and that we&#39;d go up there shortly.  At this time I was in what would be my hospital bed for the next 3 days.  I have a foley catheter and a wound vac which seals off the surgical area and puts it under a slight vacuum to extract blood and whatnot.  I think maybe it does something for the healing process also maybe?  I don&#39;t remember, but it&#39;s there.
</p>
<p>
Once the room was ready they rolled me down the hall and to the elevator and up to the 7th floor.  This trip wasn&#39;t super fun as I was pretty dizzy from the anesthesia.  Once I was in my room they hooked me up to monitoring stuff and also the leg squeezers. They also put compression socks on me.Once we were settled in they called my boyfriend who was allowed to come visit for up to 4 hours.  Because of the pandemic (if you&#39;re reading this some time in the future, my surgery happened during the coronavirus pandemic) we&#39;re only allowed 1 visitor for 4 hours at a time and ONLY if they are New York residents.  Something to be aware of if you&#39;re coming here from out of state for your surgery, they may not let you have out of state visitors.
</p>
<p>
My boyfriend showed up and we hung out for a while.  I wasn&#39;t in any pain, just some discomfort.  I had a LOT of gas.  A LOT.  Nurses constantly came in to check vitals and give me various pills.  I was chatting with my boyfriend and happily sipping away on my water, of which they bring you plenty by the way.  I always had at least 4 cups of water on my table at all times.  All of a sudden I threw up.  There was almost no warning, I wasn&#39;t feeling nauseous, just dizzy. Thankfully it was just water so it was pretty easy to come out and I managed to contain most of it in the very convenient  hard plastic rimmed bags they provide for vomit.  They gave me an anti nausea med through the IV.  This made me EXTREMELY dizzy for some reason which didn&#39;t subside until around 11pm or so.   They brought me dinner at 5pm and I was afraid to eat it.  I managed to have 2 baby carrots and left the rest alone.  I wasn&#39;t hungry at all anyway.  I got some sleep here and there between various disturbances by nurses and eventually the next day rolled around.
</p>
<p>
Also forgot to mention the uh... I have no idea what this thing is called but you have to breathe in through it a few times an hour to help prevent pneumonia.  Pro tip, your lungs can&#39;t expand as much when you&#39;re laying down, try to sit up while doing this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 2:
</strong>
I was much less dizzy on the second day and still no pain.  Just lots and lots of gas.  They brought me breakfast which I ate some of, still didn&#39;t have a big appetite, but I also don&#39;t usually eat breakfast.  That morning they also had me walk to the door of the room and back.  It didn&#39;t hurt at all and was pretty easy going.  The day continued mostly as usual, they brought me lunch and more pills and eventually took me off the IV fluids and took off vitals monitor they had strapped to one of my fingers.  I was now free from cables on the upper half of my body, this was nice.  They left the thing in my hand to temporarily attache syringes to for medicine, which is how they provide the anti nausea meds and also a form of motrin which I forgot the actual name of.  Since those anti nausea meds did not react well for me they only used it for the motrin.
</p>
<p>
The motrin is NOT fun.  It burns going in and if the nurse isn&#39;t great at administering meds this way can go very wrong very quickly.  The first nurse to do this was very careful and did it nice and slow and made sure to flush everything through with saline after.  The second nurse to do this quite frankly sucked.  She rushed putting it in and then it didn&#39;t all flush out and by the time she walked out the door, and I put my hand down flat and the meds shifted... my hand quite literally felt like it was on fire.  I hit the call button immediately, by the time they answered I was crying and trying to explain what happened wasn&#39;t very easy.  I knew a panic attack was coming.  I got the nurse to get some saline to flush it more but it was too late, I was already hyperventilating.  My panic attacks are not fun and always involve loss of feeling and motor function in my extremities.  Since I was having a panic attack I didn&#39;t think to say I was having a panic attack and kept telling them I couldn&#39;t feel or move my hands.  They kept telling me my hand was fine now, which it was... And I finally said I know, but I&#39;m having a panic attack.  At this point the nurse, CNA, and PA were in the room with me.  The PA went and got me xanax, which probably did nothing in the long run since it takes a bit to kick in.  The CNA stayed with me and helped me do breathing exercises while the nurse did mostly nothing aside from monitor my vitals.  Once my breathing calmed down and I was starting to get feeling back in my hands I asked if the CNA could stay for a bit with me.  She talked about how she recently watched Umbrella Academy.  She was rather amusing and had me laughing a bit, taking my mind off of everything.  She was lovely.  I can&#39;t remember her name but if you ever stay at Mount Sinai I hope you get this CNA because she is an angel.
</p>
<p>
Day 2 progressed more smoothly after that and I was switched to oral motrin instead of IV.  The reason they give you it through the IV is because its hard on your stomach, but at this point I was eating and it was no longer an issue.  The next dose was after dinner, which I actually ate most of and it was actually pretty decent for hospital food.  My best advice for any hospital stay now is to make sure they go over what pills they&#39;re giving you.  They come in with pills at all kinds of hours and sometimes it may have been a while since you ate.  If you&#39;re on a high dose of something like advil, it will screw up your stomach if you haven&#39;t eaten.  If you know you&#39;re going to have an issue taking something like that don&#39;t be afraid to ask them for something quick to eat first.  Mount Sinai will bring you saltines or graham crackers, your choice.
</p>
<p>
They had me walk again that evening, and as usual no issues.  I got some sleep between nurses bringing me pills at night, nothing else to report.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 3:
</strong>
Actually ate most of my breakfast.  At this point my appetite was getting better.  They eventually came in and had me walk.  The nurse that morning also offered to let me brush my teeth, which was nice.  Again, no issues with any of this and still no pain, only discomfort from the ever persisting gas.  I had the PA check me at one point, i think on day 2, and my stomach was more tender than the surgical area, wild stuff.  I saw tons of reports of people not experiencing much if any pain and never thought that would be my experience, but here we are.  I only feel an occasional ping or flash of minor pain in... I have no idea, I guess my clit or something.  It&#39;s kinda hard to identify where things are right now, but I can tell you it feels like a specific part of what used to be the head of my penis.
</p>
<p>
They had me walk again in the afternoon, again went pretty well, no pain.  I got a decent amount of sleep this night, especially considering it was the 4th of July.  I was also super lucky and my room had an AWESOME view of the NYC skyline.  The empire state building was smack in the middle of my window and was lit up with all kinds of different light patterns for the 4th.  They also launched a whole bunch of fireworks from the empire state building and coordinated the lighting with it as well.  It was pretty spectacular.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day 4:
</strong>
Discharge day.  Walked again in the morning, this time we went out in the hall a bit.  The nurse came in eventually and we talked about discharge.  They discharge at 10am, but they&#39;re not going to kick you out if you&#39;re not ready yet.  They had not told me previously what time discharge was and my boyfriend got the message a bit late so I didn&#39;t leave until closer to 11am.  She went over all the stuff she was sending me home with and was not opposed to throwing in extras for me when I asked.  My boyfriend showed up and she taught him how to empty the urine bag and how to change the collection cartridge on the wound vac.
</p>
<p>
Again, completely unusual as far as I&#39;m aware, they had me walk all the way from the room to outside the building where I was picked up.  No wheelchair or anything.  I mean, I guess that might make sense in this case since we aren&#39;t supposed to sit, but it was also a lot of steps which is also not great *shrug*
</p>
<p>
The ride home was pretty easy.  We live in Brooklyn and there was hardly any traffic today so it took about half an hour.  It took me a minute to figure out how to safely get in my car, but with the donut and putting my seat all the way back, I was pretty comfy and no strain was on the surgical site.  I got a bit dizzy at times during the ride but otherwise I was fine, except for the potholes... ugh.  Also, my seatbelt landed right on top of my abdomen where I&#39;m pretty sensitive due to the gas.  Holding a bit of slack in the seatbelt helped improve comfort so it wasn&#39;t pressing on me.  I got settled in at home and everything I need set up on the dresser next to my bed.  My boyfriend and I set up reminders on our phones for when to take each medication (theres 7 of them).
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t mention earlier but on day 1 they sent a whole bunch of prescriptions to the pharmacy for me after discharge.  My boyfriend picked them up on day 2.  I didn&#39;t think to go over them and make sure he got everything, but we should have definitely done this before hand.  They didn&#39;t actually hand me a list of prescriptions until they day of discharge, so ask for this on day 1 and share with your care taker to make sure they get everything.  Not sure if it was the pharmacy or the hospital, but he didn&#39;t get the colace or the tylenol.  Fortunately we were able to acquire the correct value of tylenol over the counter (higher doses are only available by prescription but i was able to get 325mg over the counter and I can take 2 to make the 650mg dose.  And the correct colace dose was available over the counter too.  All in all, very glad I decided to go over it when I got home otherwise I would have missed a round of pain meds and that would not have been good.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, they sent me home with the following items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dialator set
</li>
<li>
Bed pads
</li>
<li>
The breathing exercise thing I mentioned before
</li>
<li>
An extra collection cartridge for the wound vac
</li>
<li>
Instruction manual for the wound vac
</li>
<li>
Bottle to empty the urine into so someone can dump it in the toilet without taking your whole self and all your attachments to the toilet
</li>
<li>
Bath washcloths so you can clean yourself while you can&#39;t shower
</li>
<li>
Hospital slippers, not sure why
</li>
<li>
Replacement hose for the wound vac in case the hose gets clogged
</li>
<li>
More tape to reseal the wound vac if it has a leak somewhere
</li>
<li>
Gloves (They were&#39;t going to give me any but I asked about gloves and they were happy to give me some) (Its been kinda hard to find gloves during the pandemic)
</li>
<li>
And 2 of those neat vomit bags I mentioned earlier for good measure (also not a standard item, they just happened to be in my room and they can&#39;t reuse them at that point)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, random last mention... My ears are gauged and I was afraid of not being able to put my jewelry back in after being out for a few hours.  I only recently got the size I&#39;m at so any significant time out can make it hard to put back in.  The reason they always tell you no jewelry is because the cauterization tool they use is electric and could theoretically potentially induce current in your jewelry and burn the area.  Bella told me its kinda ridiculous because the current shouldn&#39;t be traveling that far in your body (though obviously a belly button piercing could be a legit concern), but I wore glass jewelry to the hospital and they were okay with me leaving this in.  So if you want to keep your gauges, wear something non-conductive and as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with you laying on the table properly theres no reason you can&#39;t keep it in.

I’m 18 months post with Dr Ting, so my experience was very similar to yours. I was very happy with my time at Mt Sinai - everyone was really nice!
</p>
<p>
When I was discharged, they brought in a wheelchair, and when I sat down, the nurse told me that the wheelchair wasn’t for me, but for my stuff. I was to walk out of the hospital, pushing a wheelchair with my supplies, the wound vac, and the catheter bag.
</p>
<p>
I also walked into the surgical suite - I thought it was odd, but it wasn’t a big deal.
</p>
<p>
Congratulations on your surgery! The first few weeks are a trip, but after a month or so, you’ll start feeling a bit more back to usual.

Thats funny, they didn&#39;t bring a wheelchair for me, it would have been nice to have something extra to hold on to for stability, but the nurse held my arm and my boyfriend took all the stuff.  He went ahead of us to get the car so that I wouldn&#39;t have to stand outside long.
</p>
<p>
And yeah everyone was great except that one nurse who messed up the IV meds... and I mean, she was also nice... she just wasn&#39;t great at doing that one thing heh
</p>
<p>
Anyway, thanks.

I also had Dr Bella Avanessian but my surgery was on 7/30/20 and except for your panic attacks and nausea, my experience was almost a carbon copy. I am now just over 3 weeks post op and at my home now, resting and healing well. I have had very little blood and no complications so far (knock on wood!) and my next appointment is in November.
</p>
<p>
Every staff person it seemed made sure I was comfortable, and checked on me often. The dietician even found me an extra package of cookies that I had liked!
</p>
<p>
Dr Bella is easy to talk to and listens to you for what you are looking to have done. I was very sensitive the moment they peeled away everything and when the packing was removed, I just about jumped out of the chair when she touched my clit!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy to talk about my experience, if anyone wants to know. Lynn

I&#39;m a little ahead of you, but this mostly reads like a very accurate description of most of my experience as well
</p>
<p>
Differences/additions: - Wasn&#39;t groggy when waking up... But had a hard time communicating because I was so dry in the throat. I had warned them that I get nauseous under general, so I&#39;m not sure what protocols they may have changed for that. - No vomiting here, but did get very nauseous after my first time eating. I was able to calm it down myself though.  - I had room 702,  which only had the view when I was walking around. Sounds like you may have had 701? Jealous :p The hospitality guy was telling me that those are the best two rooms on the floor though, so I can&#39;t complain too much lol - Maybe I missed it if you said it, but man.. the worst part of it for me was finding a part of my butt that wasn&#39;t sore after a day or two of being laid upon.  - I couldn&#39;t help but think about how I felt like a stuffed turkey, or that I was still &#34;tucked,&#34; and that nothing had changed. All the nerves still felt familiar.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in the next couple days!! That catheter will be out before you know it :)

My throat was super dry too.  I was in 703b
</p>
<p>
And yeah I may have missed detailing the laying down part, but kinda lumped that in with discomfort.  Whenever they asked me if I wanted to walk i was like hell yeah i want to walk.  I can&#39;t stand all this laying down, its killing my back.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I feel the packing really, and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m tucked.  I don&#39;t feel much of anything down there, but what I do know is when I look down I&#39;m just completely ecstatic about there not being a penis there
</p>
<p>
And yep, it all comes out on Wednesday.

I had mine with Dr. Ting about 10 days ago and had much of the same. The IV was the worst every time but the nurses were really caring about it. I was so scared when I went from admissions to my room - I couldn’t stop shaking until I got to the OR but the anaesthesiologists were the absolute best and walked me there and talked to me the whole time. I was at the end room and you could see the Empire State Building perfectly.

I was in 703b, yours must have been close to mine, or at least on the same side of the building.  Too bad you didn&#39;t get the fantastic fireworks show I got... I got a vagina AND fireworks, pretty good week :P

Congrats on your surgery, glad to hear everything went well for you!  I’ve got my surgery tomorrow morning (Tuesday) very excited a tad bit anxious idk that may change later....  I’m having mine down in my hometown of Columbus, Ohio!  Unfortunately no one has really posted about their experience with my surgeon though I did find a woman on here a couple months back who did and was very happy with her results (though never posted about it) as well as an older woman in a local trans FB group who had zero depth done (which I’d imagine has a bit of a different recovery aside from not dilating).

Thanks!
</p>
<p>
You got this.  I was a bit anxious at times on the days leading up to surgery but I was most anxious a couple weeks ago and much less anxious the couple nights leading up to surgery.  And mysteriously not anxious at all when I got to the hospital.  I thought I was going to be a mess but I wasn&#39;t.  I think part of this is due to getting my anxiety under control after the last time I had surgery.  I went into this knowing more what to expect, and thats kinda why I wanted to write this post to begin with, so other people can be more mentally prepared for whats to come.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, zero depth is definitely an easier recovery.  I briefly considered it but ultimately I wanted the full experience of having a vagina.  Well, as close to full as I can get.  Guess I&#39;m kinda glad I&#39;ll never have a period lol (Though the pack of sanitary pads next to me would be mocking me for writing that sentence right now if it could)

Thank you! Yeah I’m surprised I haven’t gotten more anxious,  I’ll probably feel that later....  Yeah I’ve read a bunch of peoples posts in the past describing their recovery / post op experience.  You did a good job describing your experience! I plan to do one as well mainly so people can easily access a testimony on my surgeons work!  I’ve had a handful of people message me about my surgeon (Dr Chris McClung) as I am the only one who has really posted about him (the other woman I found on here mentioned having surgery with him in a comment buried in some thread or something) The two people I spoke to that had it previously were both super happy with their results but for whatever reason didn’t post (well one of those people probably doesn’t use reddit as far as I know)
</p>
<p>
Yeah same, I imagine it would make sex with a future boyfriend easier.  Yeah from what I’ve read it sounds like it’s kind of like a super long single period with all the blood and other various excretions coming out post op. Hope the rest of your recovery goes well!

Yeah, theres a decent amount of stuff on Bella, but I thought I&#39;d add more to the mix.  Can&#39;t have too much info.  You should definitely post about your surgeon to get their name out there more, especially if they&#39;re particularly good.  I didn&#39;t know there was any surgeons in Ohio, most surgeons seem to be on either the east or west coast which makes things tough for central people since traveling after GRS is NOT fun.  Thankfully I&#39;m native to NYC where theres several decent ones to pick from and more surgeons in nearby states.
</p>
<p>
Also, more people will report negative service experiences than positive.  I learned this working retail years ago, and this isn&#39;t exactly retail but I&#39;m sure theres a similar discrepancy in surgery too.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I can&#39;t wait to get my boyfriend in there haha, I just hope he fits lol
</p>
<p>
From what I gather a lot of people seem to over prepare for excretions.  I got light overnight pads and panty liners on hand for when my packing comes out, those should be more than enough to deal with everything.  But every body is different and every surgeon has different techniques which result in different recoveries.

Yeah, in my research I found a people talking about their experience with various East/west coast surgeons as well as some of the big names.  There’s actually another surgeon that does the procedure in Cleveland but that’s 3 hours away from me.  My parents are friends with one of the head gynecologists at Ohio State who said my surgeon was very good at what he does.  He’s done around 40 other vaginoplastys before me (though that number is kinda old as that was 6months back) I feel pretty confidant with him as he seems to do most types of surgery of the genitalia.  I’m pretty sure (can’t remember where/when I heard this...) he got his start with trans patients initially repairing surgeries gone wrong.  He also seems to prioritize trans surgeries so that’s pretty great.
</p>
<p>
Hmm ok,  I got some period panties, panty liners and a big pack of overnight pads.  So if what you’re saying is the case for me as well I should be good!
</p>
<p>
I’m currently struggling with my clean out... I’m actually really worried my surgeries gonna get delayed  now because I’m having such a hard time :( I’m supposed to drink 10 ounces of Magnesium Citrate as a laxative and it’s not going well at all... my first attempt I drank the whole thing in one sitting followed by a glass of water, got super nauseous and about 30 min later threw most of it up.  They had me try a second attempt which this time I split in half doing 1 half, drinking water take a break then finish the other half.  I got the first half down took an hour break (still super nauseous) kept it done and then after the second half I threw up again (though way less than the first time) :(  Ughh now they’re no longer at the hospital for the day and I can’t get ahold of anyone I would need to tell.  Ughh I really hope they don’t have to push my date back

Congratulations hun glad it went well, just stay inside and relax, the wheelchair might have been due to covid, if they only have a limited amount and they don&#39;t want to keep cleaning them it might make more sense to just not use them at all or only for people who are unable to walk.
