What is it? Is it beneath the skin of the vaginal canal or directly exposed to the surface? How are the nerves connected ?

I know nothing about suporn&#39;s techniques other than what I just read but it is described as this, &#34;Vestibule of Vagina between the Labia Minora¬†‚Äì ‚ÄòSecondary Sexual Sensated Organ‚Äô from glans penis with intact sensory nerves and vessels&#34;. What this seems to allude to is that they align the portion of the vulva between the clitoris and the vaginal canal with tissue from the glans. Not sure how this works or why it may be more beneficial. I guess perhaps there would be more sensory there after the fact.

As an owner of one, I can answer this.
</p>
<p>
So basically they take the glans and separate out what is to be the clit, what&#39;s left is the outside part of the glans where it meets the foreskin, he takes that and folds it in half and places it below the clit, basically between the urethra and the clit. Tbh, it&#39;s not as sensitive as I was expecting and most of my sensation comes from the clit but it does add something. It does make it look a tad bit strange unfortunately but that&#39;s just the price you pay for not wasting anything.

Not mine (it&#39;s from his research paper). If you look below the clit is the grey bit, it&#39;s in there, if you stretch it open fully you&#39;ll end up seeing the two sides of the glans pushed together in the middle.

It definitely does in my case, but it&#39;s not the case for everyone.
</p>
<p>
Theres also other things that make it clockable though. If I was sleeping with someone who didn&#39;t know (which I generally don&#39;t like doing) my biggest fear would be for them to go down on me.

I see. Could that be because you are still not full healed yet?? ‚ù§Ô∏è From what I heard, I thought Suporn/bank‚Äôs results are super unclockable ??

The posterior commissure, placement of the urethra, lack of &#34;proper&#34; clitoral hood and a few other small things still give it away. I&#39;m also 3 years post, so healing isn&#39;t an issue

Thank you for sharing your experience, and I&#39;m so sorry to hear that too! ü•∫ü•∫
</p>
<p>
I hope they could help you fix them in your revision surgery? From what I read here, I read a lot of people their revision can make very good result? I hope this is the case and good option for you. üå∏

I already went for revision. I got a really bad infection that left me with a pretty bad scar.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not unhappy with my results, they&#39;re fine for me and I&#39;m glad I went to Suporn. I don&#39;t really care too much about how it looks anymore.

If you have necrosis of your clitoris it can act as a backup.

You‚Äôd be going back for a revision anyway then and I expect you could get it done then. Perhaps burying it deeper would be a better idea.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs internal though and that‚Äôs where all surgery is weakest. I‚Äôd try not to get too hung up on it.
