Got botched in Wi 4 years ago. Ended up almost drinking myself to death, eating disorder and deep deep depression. Please be careful. Open for questions.

Gast in WI and Kassis in TN. She left all of the erectile tissue around the urethra behind. And only looked like a vagina if you squinted really hard. So it was functionally impossible to have sex and looked bad. Having a depth revision later this year. Her office was giving out cis vaginismus dilators that only went up to an inch. Really hope at the very least that has changed. Truly awful experience with her team in WI too. Don’t know how but TN has the best trans care I’ve ever received.

Glad to hear you had a good experience with Dr. Kassis! Thinking about him since he’s the closest to me and I trust Vanderbilt overall (care-wise)

Yeah! He’s great. His team is great. He said he gets a lot of people coming to him to fix their previous surgeries. Highly recommend.

Cool! Do you mind if I ask how long your wait from consultation was? I haven’t had any laser down there so I’m assuming that’s gonna be the more limiting factor since Dr. Kassis does PI, but if it’s gonna be a lot longer I may go with another doc to do PPT, since being able to self-lubricate is something of a priority for me.

I started with breast implants with Vanderbilt I called on august 15th to schedule a consult and had the surgery  end of September. This revision process with insurance and whatnot started october 15? and I just had the surgery. So it’s super quick if insurance is on top of it.

I had basically the exact same experience with Gast too, had to have things fixed in Oregon but the damage of course was already done. It&#39;s bonkers this keeps happening to folks yet she&#39;s not considered a hack doctor yet.

I had vaginalplasty with Dr gas about 2 and a half years ago with Dr gas and after my surgery I wad in tha hospital for 5 days and the morning that I wad going to go home, she was taking the packing out and she said that my wall came down and I wad her 1st patient that she had complications with. later that day I had to have surgery again to fix my wall and they graft my skin tissue from my upper thigh and now I have a huge scare now. so I ended up I n the hospital for another 7 days 12 days in the hospital all together. because of what happened I don&#39;t  have hardly any depth maybe an inch maybe and it is so depressing sometimes I feel like a freak. I asked her if she could do a revision to get my depth were it should be and she told me that there was nothing that she could do. I wonder now if I can get a revision to fix my get some normal depth? I still like dr gas but it is unfortunate that this happened to me.

I’m so so sorry. I ended up with like 2 inches depth. I think there is a reason she refuses to show photos. I think she’s a hack. I felt deformed and like she left part of my dead self behind. And when I asked for help they just shrugged and suggested I go to Rumer because I was moving to PA. I’m really shocked at how many people are coming out of the woodwork with bad experiences from her. There clearly needs to be more oversight of the people who get to treat the trans community.

when I had my consultation with her I asked her if she ever had any complications with any of her patients and she told me no. and when that happened to me she said that I was her only patient that that happened to. now I wonder. well after hearing that there is hope now I feel a little relieved. I am so sorry of what happened to you also. I just hope that my insurance will cover my revision if I can get a revision done. thank you for talking about all of this it gives me hope.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear what you went through! I hope your revision continues to work out.
</p>
<p>
I read all your posts and was wondering what Gast&#39;s team said when you told them about the problems and then I read this comment you made -
</p>
<p>
<strong>
And when I asked for help they just shrugged and suggested I go to Rumer because I was moving to PA.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The hack (as you described Gast) wouldn&#39;t help and suggested you go see
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/icsahu/when_surgeons_fail_their_trans_patients_on_gender/" rel="nofollow">Rumer
</a>
, the reported butcher of Pennsylvania. That&#39;s just astounding and appalling.
</p>
<p>
I was very tempted to go to Gast because I live in Wisconsin and fortunately before I got that far, I found this subreddit and with WIKI with links to posts like yours.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing your experience and I hope you are doing well now.

Also she says she never has complications or complaints but it’s clearly not true. At my consult she said that no one would ever know i wasn’t cis. And then left me with crazy scars and sunken areas.  I had no idea they could do a depth revision but kassis said it was possible when I had my examination. Again I’m really sorry that happened to you and I hope you can find another surgeon and some peace.

Honestly I don’t recommend that anyone get vaginoplasty in any states besides NY, MA, NJ, CA where all of the top residency hospitals and teaching schools are.. and ladies Please… always pick a surgeon with considerable experience- more than 15 years in practice*** vaginoplasty is serious- it’s not a hole- it’s a functional organ- you want someone extensively trained, preferably a part time professor at that at a teaching hospital- Mt Sinai, NYU, Uni of Mass, Princeton Med, etc. stay away from the other states because frankly… they’re very new with these procedures and it’s a cash grab for them. STAY AWAY

That’s pretty reductive. You’re not taking into account any type of monetary hardship. Most people can afford these surgeries without insurance or going deep into debt.  Moving to one of said states to qualify is more than likely not an option especially because you mentioned 4 out of the 10 most expensive states to live in.
</p>
<p>
Yeah I wish I had done more research. But damn you’re making some wildly classist assumptions here. I barely break 12k a year. Options are few for the poor.

I understand your point but I was just expressing my honest concern with these newer surgeons. Of course I understand the financial barrier- but a lot of these states do offer insurance benefits and within your own state it’d be a good idea as well to check out of state benefits for specialist surgeries sometimes if you pull their teeth with appeals they’ll eventually give in. Didn’t mean it a harsh way was just trying to be helpful and stress the severity to the girls, these newer surgeons out here don’t care about us, they just want the $$$$

That’s fair. I assumed going to UW hospital was smart. Tier 1 research university buncha good reviews. I should have been paying more attention to the lack of information and FaceTime with the surgeon and how absolutely apathetic their team were. Feel like that’s made a world of difference this go round.
