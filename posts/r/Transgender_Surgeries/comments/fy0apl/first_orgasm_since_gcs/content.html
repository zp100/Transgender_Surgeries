It&#39;s been 157 days since my vaginoplasty and I had not experienced an orgasm. I thought I did a few times during vaginal sex with some men, some of the sex was good, but nothing felt as good today. I finally figured out I needed 2 vibrators to get the job done, which makes me a bit worried for sex again but I remind myself that the sensation is not 100% back yet, maybe 85% at this point inside the vagina and clitoral area.

Just throwing this out there for anyone searching for their orgasm after surgery :)

Penile Inversion?  Do you feel you have more feminine orgasms now?  In that it&#39;s not focused on your privates vs entire body and lasts longer but not as immediate.

Penile inversion with peritoneal graft from testicular sac at Mount Sinai. Left a puddle on my bed after I finished lol.
</p>
<p>
I think it felt similar to the orgasms I had before the surgery, that tightening of muscles between the legs and hyper sensitivity of my clit (previously penile head). Just no sensation of shooting liquid.
</p>
<p>
I will say the ride to the orgasm feels more like waves. Whereas the orgasms I had before surgery felt more like  an uptick/race to the finish. This orgasm was much more enjoyable than any orgasm I had when I had taken hormones before the surgery.

Thanks for sharing this. I was searching this thread because I am at month 3.5 after my surgery with Dr. Pang, and am having a very slow reentry into sexual feelings. I can&#39;t tell if it is just depression because of this stupid society shutdown, or I&#39;m just healing at a slow pace, or what. But your day count got me a bit relaxed and helps me take it slightly easy.
