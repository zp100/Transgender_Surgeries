Thank you! Type 3 forehead (which I’m SO pleased with), lip lift and fat infiltration to lips, and jaw/chin contour. Those are the things he recommended. My experience with him and his staff has been superb. I highly recommend him.

Fantastic, considering him, because I also don&#39;t plan a tons, but jaw/chin is a must for me. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

Thank you, I am! Lots of healing left to do, of course. I went with what he recommended, which is what I thought I needed too: forehead (type 3, determined during the procedure), lip lift and fat infiltration, jaw and chin contour. 😊

Thanks! One thing I&#39;m trying to figure out actually is if he gave you a timeline on the recovery. Specifically how long until you can go back to &#34;risky&#34; outdoor activities. I heard a few different things and Hatzia only said 3 weeks for regular activity and that I have to ask him about other things. Just waiting on a consultation in a few weeks. :)

That’s a good question. I absolutely did push it by going out to dinner a couple times this week. Not dangerously, but I was tired afterwards. Today is my last day before flying out and I’m going to spend it icing and relaxing.
</p>
<p>
There are many, many timelines involved here: how long until I can get my head wet in the shower?; how long on certain meds?; how long until I can start applying ointment for scarring?; how long until etc., etc., etc. To me, it seems that the most limiting thing now is recovering from the orchiectomy. It’s been fine so far but that’s what has really taxed me when I have tried to go out.
</p>
<p>
The face stuff is less limiting it seems, though I am really looking forward to chewing food and brushing/flossing like I used to. No idea how long that will take, though. My jaw is pretty numb and I can’t yet open my mouth wide without pain, so I have to take tiny bites of soft food. Any hard or tough food are practically impossible. I tried to eat some crusty bread last night and gave up after the second bite.

That&#39;s great to hear that the face stuff hasn&#39;t been as limiting as the orchi! I guess I&#39;m curious if he mentioned how long until you could do some kind of sports (skiing in my case). Did he mention anything about needing to wait for bone to heal or something or just soft tissue?

Thank you! That honestly sounds wonderful and I think I will take that recommendation if at all possible. I will be at the hospital today and tomorrow, then flying back to the States early Friday morning.

Thank you! The pink, green, and white one was purchased from a very sweet street vendor while I was sitting there and I got the others at a local artist market, Tlaquepaque, a day before the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The pain has been minimal to say the least. Frankly, I would say there has been
<em>
no
</em>
pain, only discomfort. The swelling was pretty intense for the first few days, especially in my mouth, but even that was nothing compared to how I felt after my first electrolysis appointment about ten years ago.

Oh wow. Mine is in October and I&#39;ve honestly been a little worried about the pain. Were you scared right before the surgery when they were putting you under cause my heart races just thinking about that 😅 they said its minimal 6-8 weeks off work recovery for it but would you say that&#39;s necessary if you&#39;re feeling mostly fine after just a week?
</p>
<p>
Sorry for all the questions, it&#39;s just getting close and I&#39;m growing more nervous  lol

Yes, I was scared before, but that’s normal. I found a lot of comfort in their efficiency, the modern facility, and in the knowledge that these people perform these sorts of procedures day in-day out, year after year.
</p>
<p>
You asked about pain and it is true I have felt practically none. That is partly due to the numbness. I forgot to mention that I have felt some pain where the fat was procured. There is some bruising there and I have felt sharp pain there once or twice when getting dressed.
</p>
<p>
6-8 weeks sounds reasonable. I’m still very swollen and my hairline incision looks scary, hence the headband. I am feeling mostly fine but I am also using a fair amount of strong concealer in this photo to mask bruising on my upper lip, around my eyes, and on my neck where much of the fluid from higher up collects. In person I feel I do not look “normal” yet.
</p>
<p>
Again, I just want to reiterate that it is perfectly normal to be scared before surgery and to put out your well deserved trust in the expertise of your chosen surgeon and their team. They know what they are doing and this happens to be a collection of surgeries with a very low complication rate. I believe you will be fine and as thrilled as I am with the results.
</p>
<p>
I’m here for any other questions you may have. :)

Wow, thank you. That was super informative and actually does help calm me about it. Hearing others experiences and the happiness they feek about their results is keeping me more excited than nervous so thanks again for indulging my curiosity 😊 I made the mistake of looking at surgery videos yesterday and freaked myself out a bit so it definitely helps hearing your surgery went so well!

I’m so glad it helped! And yeah, I watched a recording of a Type 3 forehead surgery a few months back. I wouldn’t say it scared me exactly but I was intimidated. It looks so extreme. However, the healing is straight forward and I have had no pain in my forehead at all. The human body is incredible.

Oh, one last question I promise 😂 did they use a metal fixture to secure the bone back to your skull or a dissolvable one? Cause I think I&#39;ve heard of both and the thought of having metal always in my skull is strange 😅

You can ask as many questions as you like!
</p>
<p>
It looks to me like they used stitches across most of the incision and then used one or two staples at each end.

Oh I meant for affixing the removed part of your skull back to the skull. Idk if it&#39;s the same across the board but my surgeon described it as removing a plate of bone on my brow, reshaping it, then reattaching it.

Ohhhh sorry, I misunderstood. Dr. Cardenas said that the bone there was “broken, reshaped, and reattached,” I think. I have to wear a headband around my brow for the first few weeks in order to encourage blood flow and to make the skin rebound to the bone. But no, there is no metal there, just my own revised bone.
</p>
<p>
Although, I may be mistaken. I will ask tomorrow during my last appointment!

I&#39;m going to be back for a checkup in a month. I&#39;m going to plan some touring then. i was disappointed to miss Pride on Saturday, but it was really hot and it&#39;s all cis women at the recovery house I am in right now. Last time I was here it was all transgender women.

We (my partner and i) didn’t know pride was gonna happen and were so surprised and happy to hear the sounds of celebration going past our apartment that we starting crying tears of joy! Over 250,000 people! They were streaming past for hours. It was such a ray of hope and sunshine.

That&#39;s beautiful. Both time I came here for surgery I&#39;ve stayed in a recovery house away from the central district.

Thank you! That’s what I want, and is a big reason why I chose Cardenas aside from how affordable he is. I am a teacher and a mom. The subtle but dramatic (an oxymoron but I don’t know how else to phrase it) changes I noted in his other patients convinced me I’d still look like “me” afterward.

I haven&#39;t been able to get out into Guadalajara very much. I got srs and some facial work done in September. Recovery then was much faster. I&#39;ve barely been out of my room for the two weeks post op.

Same here. Yesterday was my first day out since surgery and I knew that I was really pushing it. I was lucky enough to have 3 days to tour before surgery though, and got to enjoy many of the sights, sounds, and wonderful foods of Guadalajara during that time. Even got a chance to see some pyramids in the countryside.

Thank you very much! This picture really stunned me. Is hard to believe it is me.

<p>
And yes, I am already planning a return trip. Just blown away by everything - the lovely people, out-of-this-world food, the culture, and history. Not to mention how affordable everything is for those of us coming from the US and Canada.

edit: Actually I’m going to ask anyway, because we have decided to have a very “Guadalajara” meal delivered on our last night. Where would you recommend for barbacoa? Our concierge said that barbacoa is an especially important thing around here.

Ohhh i see, thats a great plan and yes! Barbacoa is delicious type meat prepped as tacos with consomé but that&#39;s typically a during the day food, as local i dont even have a rec for barbacoa during the night but if you can still make it in the morning the best are Tacos Juan and Tacos Miguelon both in Santa Tere area, close to Americana. For tonight id recommend getting consome and tacos similar to barbacoa from La Betty May in Americana. Of course there are plenty other places but im trying to pin point you towards centric city places. Maybe if you tell me a reference from your location i can recommend you something thats close🌹

Thank you so much for these recommendations! I wish I had seen this in time. We decided to follow a friends advice and order food was Sanborn’s. It was so-so, but we had another friend over for dinner and that made up for the food. We did leave Guadalajara this morning, sadly, and are now safely back in the states. It’s nice being back with family. :)
