does anyone know of surgeons who accept patients in good overall health with bmi over 35 (in my case, 38)? it’s extremely hard to find consistent info; I’ve found a couple of blogs that mention Bowers and Wittenberg accepting folks on a case-by-case basis up to bmi of 40. would love any other info/options people have found - feel like fat trans women should help circulate this info with each other so we can get the care we need.
</p>
<p>
(please do not reply with recommendations to lose weight. there are so many reasons why I’m uninterested, and it’s disappointing to see trans women repeat simplified and/or false ideas around this to justify the gatekeeping. numerous recent studies do not find increased risk of complications in higher-bmi patients, and even if they did, fat trans patients should have options within an overall risk assessment. long-term weight loss is consistently shown to not be achievable for most people, regardless, and bmi is known as an outdated and fatphobic measure of health.)

My BMI was over 35 when I got both SRS procedures from Dr Stiller in Washington state (USA). Total non issue for his team, and I am recovering with only one minor complication that is getting corrected soon (I have increased scar tissue from a genetic predisposition).
</p>
<p>
I believe there is an upper limit on BMI for his procedures due  to the anesthesia, but I don&#39;t remember the exact BMI number that is.

I just had my bottom surgery with Dr. Stiller and my BMI was 39 and he didn’t even say a word to me about it.  I had to bring it up and he was very nonchalant on the topic.  He did say that the more weight I lost before surgery the better the odds are that the aesthetic outcome will be more in line with what I am wanting and the more fit I am the better the outcome for anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
The only complication I seem to have had (fingers crossed) is a bit of wound separation outside the future site of the vaginal canal (I will have stage 2 colonvaginoplasty next-yearish, but for that they were very clear I needed to have a BMI of 35 or below due to the greater surgical risk) that hurts like a MF every time I move.  Otherwise recovery has been smooth and aesthetically speaking, things are looking okay so far.

My bmi is 58 and I have the same as luck you. Many doctors don&#39;t like operating on patients with a high bmi in the first place but to give you some hope, it all depends on the doctor, the hospital or surgical suite, and the after care staff. I opted for a getting a orchiectomy so I can get off spironolactone  in the next year or so but I wish the best love!

One other reason. On the bright issue is ,I believe it was Marci bowers who said anything over a 30 being makes it difficult target wise as to size and shape ,might want to research this in case I forgot something  it was a few years ago I read it I believe on her site
