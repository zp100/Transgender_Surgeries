Hey yâ€™all  I had an orchiectomy Friday and Iâ€™m a bit unclear on my aftercare instructions. My surgeon told me prior to surgery but I was too hazy to remember after and the print out they sent home with me is vague and incredibly unhelpful.  I know I was supposed to take a shower today and let water run over the incision. Should I wash the incision? Do I need to use antibacterial soap? What do I need to do going forward? My only prescription besides narcotics is bacitracin for the incision.
</p>

Definitely get in touch with your surgeon&#39;s office ASAP to get better directions or clarification on the aftercare directions you were given. Just explain that the procedure made it hard to remember things, they should be understanding of that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a bit surprised they&#39;d have you shower this early, but since it is just an orchi and they told you to, then it is probably ok to get the incision wet in the shower.
</p>
<p>
Do not have the stream from the showerhead fall directly at the incision site, as that could be rough enough to harm/irritate/separate the healing tissue, instead let it run down from your abdomen and over the incision, or use your hand to redirect the water into a gentle flow over the area. Very gently clean the area but do not scrub. Lather up soap in a hand, gently spread it over and then gently let the water run it off. I was told to use a gentle soap like Ivory after my surgery, something like that should be ok. Antibacterial soap may be used if you have some, but until you get clarification just use something gentle, you can switch later if your surgeons office says to.
</p>
<p>
Try to minimize your time in the shower, as it can lead to slight swelling from water absorbtion. When you are done, gently pat the incision site dry with a clean towel. Do not use a rough wiping motion, and after you dry the rest of yourself off apply some of the Bacitracin over the incision, cover with gauze or something if they said you should.

I would call their office but they are closed today. I just wanted help getting through today. A lot of what you said resonates with what I remember them telling me so Iâ€™ll keep that in mind

Yeah, def give them a ring tomorrow. The directions I gave should get you through your shower safely though. Best of luck!

I had a similar situation with being given a sheet with vague general instructions for aftercare.
</p>
<p>
I can tell you I did not have to wash the incision, but mine was sealed with surgical glue like a big scab. I left it alone and it healed completely before I started to gently pick at the edges of the glue scab. (That was at the two week mark.)
</p>
<p>
Definitely call the office of your surgeon. A nurse should be able to answer all of your questions. They should also have your file to look at as well. Much better than Reddit.

I just had a totally different surgery and my instructions were to let water wash over the incision but to not touch it or use anything to wash it.

Would you mind naming your surgeon?

Thatâ€™s him. Very nice guy. He is the first doctor in Louisville, KY to perform gender corrective bottom surgery.

At this point you should be avoiding prolonged water on the stitches. Take a shower, but be quick...Try not to saturate the stitches with water. Gently pat the area dry.

I was told NOT to shower for the first 24 hours...
</p>
<p>
After that I could shower, but not to take a bath until after my stitches were removed a week later.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps ðŸ™‚

Make sure you are icing appropriately. A hemotoma down there is no joke.
