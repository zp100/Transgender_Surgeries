Hey, so I had complications on day 8 after bottom surgery (minimal depth with Dr. Brassard at GRS Montreal). This was after I was already discharged and home, so I had to go to the ER at a hospital closer to me. It was a whole thing with a hematoma and lots of bleeding and needing to reinsert a catheter, etc etc. Really, a bad day, but it&#39;s over now.
</p>
<p>
The only thing that still has me a little confused after the whole thing is that the urologist found some additional gauze packing fairly deep into the opening. Is this normal for minimal depth vaginoplasty? I&#39;m not supposed to have a vaginal cavity, just a small dimple; this piece of gauze doesn&#39;t imply that there&#39;s more depth behind it, right? They never mentioned this piece of gauze at GRS Montreal, so idk what&#39;s going on with it, and now I&#39;m paranoid they gave me a cavity or something by mistake? It&#39;s probably nothing, but still wanna check
</p>

The &#34;small dimple&#34; is still about an inch of depth. The amount of packing that they pull out is kinda wild, and not surprising if a small piece got left behind. If any gauze is stuck they won&#39;t pull it off as it&#39;ll come off in the baths.

I had the same procedure there and when I was having my first bath at asclipiad the nurse told me that I would find some gauze packing that was placed around the &#34;labia minora&#34; during surgery. I was told that I should let it fall out on its own and that would likely happen in the shower or bath when it gets wet. This gauze came out early for me, probably because I had issues with my catheter so I&#39;m not sure exactly where it was supposed to be but that might be the gauze that your urologist found. They told me that this gauze is left in place because the surgeon doesn&#39;t do as much cauterization in this area to preserve nerve tissue and sensation.
</p>
<p>
The technique used by the GRS Montreal folks doesn&#39;t really give a defined labia minora but according to the description that they provide they use the extra urethra lining to create this structure. My experience is that this gives a minimal amount of self lubrication in the deepest part of the dimple. Given that you had to have a new catheter put in I&#39;m not surprised that your urologist found this gauze. I don&#39;t think this is an indication that you have more depth than expected.

This is horrible that they send people home 6 days later after the surgery. Very unreasonable and risky. In Thailand you have to stay at the hospital‚Äôs special care for two three weeks after the surgery

They are finding that outcomes are better with the shorter stays. It‚Äôs also easier on the patient financially as well.

Do you have a source or more info on this? And who is &#39;they&#39;?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be in Thailand for up to 4 weeks after mine so it&#39;d be good to know more info on that and if there&#39;s anything I can do to mitigate whatever the problem is. But it&#39;d be in a hotel on my own with occasional nurse visits, not in the hospital itself; I don&#39;t think in Thailand they usually keep you in the hospital for that long anyway unlike what the person you replied to suggested. It&#39;s basically the same as being &#39;sent home&#39; in that you can go do your own thing but if your home is across the world, then at least if you&#39;re still in a hotel in the area, then you still get someone making sure things are still going ok and that if you need to go back to the surgeon for whatever emergency, then you can.

I wouldn&#39;t say its bad. I had a different surgeon than OP. However, I was so happy to leave the hospital 2 days after full depth PI vaginoplasty. I couldn&#39;t imagine staying a whole week or more. So much more comfortable at home.

2-3 weeks after zero depth? Sounds excessive. I can see the possible need to stay a bit longer if there is a cavity (especially with the flight back from Thailand), but the healing from zero depth is much faster.

It depends a lot on method. The ‚ÄúThai method‚Äù is a lot more intensive on recover than inversion which is more than zero depth.

I spent 4 days in the hospital (in NYC) for a minimal depth penile inversion. I was then sent home for a week and given an appointment to come back in a week for removal of the wound-vac and catheter.
</p>
<p>
I appreciated being sent home because I was in a familiar place, in my own bed.
</p>
<p>
I can see why &#39;medical tourism&#39; places want you to stay longer. Having you in the hospital means they can respond rapidly to any complications. The last thing you want is a complication when you&#39;re 6000+ miles away (or worse, on the plane).

I don‚Äôt know about minimal depth but for full depth vaginaplasty, one must stay at the hospital for 2 weeks for safety. In case you have an emergent case, the hospital staff will immediately help you. But if you are alone at home and have complications or any kinda urgency what is gonna happen ? This is not a breast augmentation surgery girls, sex reassignment surgery is much more serious

The next time I see my surgeon for a follow-up, I can ask. But they were very clear about what could wait for the visiting nurse (most stuff), a failure of the wound-vac (next day office visit) or emergency room (high fever, uncontrolled bleeding).
