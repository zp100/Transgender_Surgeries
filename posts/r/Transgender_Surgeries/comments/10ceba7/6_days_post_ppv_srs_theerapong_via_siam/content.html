Hey everyone i just wanted a share a short review of my srs i did with dr theerapong on january 10. Tomorrow is the big reveal and i cant wait. I was really emotional on the day of surgery and had a panic attack just before going into surgery  but the girls from siam tranformative where there to support me and calmed me down. Still i was crying on the operating table, i just had so much things going through my head at the moment. My surgery took i think about 10 hours and by 3 am i was back in my room, i got a shot of morphine then so i cant remember much of it just that my butt hurted from beeing the same position the whole time and i got really sick from the morphine and had to throw up(which hurted more then the actually pain. That is the only time i took the morphine shot and since then i only had thremadol/ibiprofhen i think, which is enough for me, i get it about 2 times and it also helpes me sleep better. Since yesterday i can also drink again and since today eat liqued food but i am only ate a little because i dont really like plus i am not that hungry also. The hardest part for me so far is the fact that you lie on your back the whole day. I will try to update here later and mayve share sone photos of the results to.

I&#39;m going mine in June with Dr. Theerapong! Being stuck only on your back all day sounds really tough--do they at least reposition you regularly so the pressure is on different parts of your back?

Well you can officially also lay on your side but it is kinda painful. Yes there will be somebody to help you and give you massages etc, she is really sweet. I would recommand you buy one of those travel neck pillows( get the foam one not the one with small balls) and put under you back or butt to move the pressure off, i had my husband get me a new on yesterday because the one that broken and i i couldnt sleep without it(thank god for the miniso that is open 24hrs a day)
