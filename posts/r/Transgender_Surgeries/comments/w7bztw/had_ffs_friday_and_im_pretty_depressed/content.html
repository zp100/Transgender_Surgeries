A trans YouTuber I watch recently got FFS. And for a while all her videos she covered up her face. I wouldn&#39;t call that vanity. I would call that a normal human reaction to your face still healing up and being swollen

<p>
Give it time!

My heart really goes out to you.
</p>
<p>
I doubt I am unique in this, but I have followed maybe a dozen people I know reasonably well from the consultation to post-op stage.  From where I sit, what you are experiencing is entirely normal.  I also know that is easy for me to say given that I do not sit where you are sitting üòÖ.
</p>
<p>
I will say is that your brain is not your friend right now.  Distract it, flood it with a lot of unrelated data.  Trying listening to an audiobook at 2-3x the speed.  Watch a LOT of movies.  Avoid the mirror.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there, my amazing friend.  The sun is shining - you just have to wait for the fog to burn off.

Two things that might cheer you up some from my experience. The girl you saw will look even better when you are healed. In 2 to 3 weeks a lot of the swelling should be gone.

Congratulations!

I feel your pain üòû! I&#39;m going through the same thing myself here in Bangkok, Thailand. I arrived here on June 8th and was in the operating room on June 10th for the first round of surgical procedures. I had the second round of surgical procedures on June 27th. Now I&#39;m waiting for the swelling to go down so I can have the last round of surgical procedures. Hang in there üôè! You are not alone!

I‚Äôm hearing his wait times for a consult are September October, his wait time for surgery is about a year. Only because he‚Äôs only in Toronto a significant amount of time throughout the year. But my date has been moved, so there is hope. He is definitely expensive but he is definitely the best choice out of anybody in Canada, which I found that going outside of Canada for Canadians, doesn‚Äôt necessarily seem to make sense as we don‚Äôt have to pay for any of the hospital fees. You only really pay for the procedures, GST, and the overnight observation which you have to because the surgery is 6+ hours usually depending on what you got. His results are pretty much the best I‚Äôve seen, he is definitely one of them more consistent surgeons. I find that you can tell the clients he‚Äôs worked on opposed to others. In the best way lol. But I truly believe that you will have to pay for the best results. If you would like to talk further feel free to message me!

Hey I know this is an old post but Im having FFS with Jumaily in May. Overnight observation wasn&#39;t part of my estimate/invoice... do they tack on that cost after or is it just included as part of procedure costs? I am getting 4-5 things done.

I waited approximately a year for surgery after my consult. I paid 35k for forehead, chin and jaw. This is not his current pricing. This was pricing from almost two years ago. My surgery had already been rescheduled because of Covid.

I went through this too after mine and it&#39;s absolutely normal to have depression after any surgery much less one that is as drastic as FFS. Since you&#39;ve had it so soon, I&#39;m guessing you might still have the nose cast on, things got a lot easier for me after that thing came off and I could see my full face. From there, really just focus on things you find fun like playing a game or hanging out with friends.

i can imagine the great suffering of FFS, i&#39;ve reseached it thoroughly. i want to do it some day regardless but right now i don&#39;t have the privilege.
</p>
<p>
but that&#39;s something that could maintain your light, that you had the privilege to do this and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. you will get through this, think about the times you will have after the proverbial war, your future is set and you only have healing to worry about. remind yourself of that, and do some things you enjoy, treat yourself gently and avoid triggers.

Congratulations exciting! I had mine FFS and tummy Tuck with Dr Lazaro Cardenas he was great amazing staff my experience was a plethora of emotions and yes distressing like you I was happy with initial results right after surgery but my face quickly became inc6 swollen and purple was constantly just looking at myself in the mirror more fixated than I should have been somedays I was like yeah I look good and others I felt like an ugly ogre! Heads up with what will eventually happen your skin is very stretched and it might look like its sagging tbat freak me out! In all it took no less than 6 months for swelling to be reduced by 95% percent and have an impression of your final results. Be patient with your body! I am unfortunately one of those insecure people before and even more after transition  having more work done on my face in Jan 2023  lipo fat grafting to contour my facial fwatures and a lip lift and finally adams apple shave .. ive had so much work done already almost embarrassed to admit but I think most of us Transitionng want not only to pass but be considered attractive that is the hardest part I dont want to be homely looking I want to look nice for myself and confident. Howabout yourself how are you feeling?? Let me know if you want suggestions or have any questions??  Pm message youcheers from the Jello capital if theworld! Salt Lake City! üòÜ

Just be patient hun. Easy to say and hard to do. I had ffs on March 8th and in just the last few weeks my face has gotten soooooooo much better. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. I need to post some updated pics come to think of it.
</p>
<p>
The swelling and pressure are a bitch and the healing process sucks. But once you are over that 1st hump when the swelling ‚Äòappears‚Äô to have gone away, then you‚Äôll be smooth sailing from there on. Cause it just looks better and better everyday.
</p>
<p>
I can‚Äôt believe 4 months later and it‚Äôs still getting prettier and prettier hun. Hang in there üíóüíñüíóüíñüíóüíñüíó‚ù£Ô∏è

I&#39;m so sorry your struggling. Not dismissing the physical elements but just wanted mention that depression is common even with most mundane of surgeries. You went through big fight getting there and even in the absolute best of best amazing situations whether that surgery, graduation with masters there is big period time where mind needs chance to catch up and come terms after the mental battles its been through. I&#39;m 12 weeks post-op for PIV and can tell that depression hit me hard and I&#39;m still working through it. The message I keep getting is that need give myself a break. I need remind myself what I just went through. Give myself time heal, time to grow, and time for my mind to heal as well.
</p>
<p>
Best luck and stay strong. Try keep your head high and show yourself some love and care.

Someone once mentioned that most sub-skim surgeries can result in severe but ultimately temporary bouts of depression.. I&#39;m not a doctor so I can&#39;t confirm or deny. Honestly it sounds a little like an old wives&#39; tale.
</p>
<p>
But if true, it&#39;s good to keep in mind that what you&#39;re feeling may just be a side effect of the surgery. Much love girl.
</p>
<p>
P.S. I have a date with Dr. J in November and can&#39;t wait. Glad you saw her! You will see her again!

I had full FFS in February. Two-three days is like peak swelling! I was out and about after a couple of weeks. It‚Äôs only gotten better and better since then. You will be amazed how quickly the swelling goes down. And in 2-3 weeks you will be in the ‚Äúimperceptible swelling‚Äù phase where no one can tell that you‚Äôre still swollen. Ice!
