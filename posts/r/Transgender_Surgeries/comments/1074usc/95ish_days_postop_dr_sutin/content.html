A lot of changes from a month ago!  I had stitches come out of my clitoral hood a few days ago and my inner labia and hood shrank/unswelled(?) Which made a huge improvement in aesthetic and pleasure.

Hello, you are having a good recovery, when you are completely recovered you will have a very good result, I have a few questions: How is your recovery going? How are vaginal dilations? How is the vaginal depth? Have you noticed any changes in your digestive system?

Hi, thank you.  When I took the video this pic is from I was amazed by the changes since the last time I took a look down there.
</p>
<p>
Recovery is going well, but I still have energy crashes - they are much milder than the intense ones, but still a challenge during the day.  I did have quite a bit of post-op depression which seems to be improving also.
</p>
<p>
Vaginal dilation is going well.  Depth is pretty good 6.5&#34; but I am stretching it to seven per my doctor&#39;s instructions.  I could not go full depth when I first started dilation because the end of the vaginal canal was still sealing shut with colon technique.
</p>
<p>
No changes to my digestive system as far as I&#39;m aware, which I guess means no problems.
</p>

I am glad that everything is going well for you, I hope it continues like this, I have two other questions: How has the sensitivity and functionality been? Are you planning to have revision surgery?

Sensitivity is awesome and continuing to get better.  I am on the fence about revision.  I think this latest look down there has me really pleased compared to a couple weeks ago.  So I think I&#39;m going to see how it goes a year after surgery.

Do you recommend colon technique? How does the ring feels(the connection part of 2 grafts)? How wet is it and does it needs additional lube for PI?

I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for everyone because it is an intense surgery (more like two major surgeries combined into one), and it is about double the price of PI techniques, but I&#39;m very pleased with it and would recommend it to folks who really prioritize function.  I haven&#39;t had penetrative sex yet, because I want it to get stronger first.  But I have used vibrators and digital penetration, and I&#39;ve received oral, and the sensation is very nice.  No additional lube needed.  I still use lube for dilation, however.  It is quite wet, and even more so when aroused.  It definitely gets the macaroni in a pot sound when it&#39;s being played with.
</p>
<p>
So the ring between the two grafts is noticeable to the touch, it is at the part of the canal which shifts direction from downward to up inside me.  It is quite tight, and I think the primary goal of dilation at this point is just to get that ring to stretch to accommodate girth.

I just heard the ring always closes and need to be tighten up all the time and men can feel it when enter. I would ask your opinion If i have a good depth with skin graft do i need to do colon srs just to be wet down there?

My assumption is that right now men would be able to feel it possibly.  Knowing men, it would be an asset/improvement because it must surely feel really good.  The downside is that they may come more quickly, or if they aren&#39;t hard enough have difficulty slipping it in.  But as I go up in dilator size, it shouldn&#39;t be a problem I would guess unless he is super girthy.  But if he is that girthy then maybe he wouldn&#39;t notice the ring.

No, I did not do any electrolysis or laser prior to surgery.  One of the benefits of colon technique is that practically no skin is internal, so the need for hair clearance is not essential.
