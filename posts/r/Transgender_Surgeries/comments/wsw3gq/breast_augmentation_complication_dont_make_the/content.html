Do no make the same mistake I did. Listen to your body, listen to your surgeon, and follow their instructions.  I had a breast augmentation on 7//21/22. Everything went well with surgery. I had the normal post-op pain and soreness. My surgeon told me my skin and muscles are really tight (yaaay asian genes). Therefore she‚Äôd expect me to be in some pain after surgery. But I felt great. I was off narcotic pain meds by day 3 after surgery and just using tylenol and ice. I had my post op a week later, 7/28/22, and my surgeon noticed my right side a little more swollen. I admitted I had sex 2 days after surgery. Big No No as this can raise your blood pressure and heart rate and can cause bleeding. The surgeon put in work to have the pocket with no blood when the implant is in, as this can cause capsular contracture. So slap on the wrist and told to take it easy. Fast forward another week and I felt 100% I thought I‚Äôd go back to work. So 2 weeks after surgery I picked up a shift and worked 8 hours. I was pretty sore but thought it was normal, I had just worked. Fast forward another week, so 3 weeks out now, I was at work again and that day was an easy day. I sat and did computer work all day. My back got sore mid day and tried stretching my back. End of the work day my Right Breast got more sore and swollen. I thought I was just tired because I was carrying my purse and my work bag, another bad idea. Got into my car and my right breast was swollen and rock hard. Felt like I was cramping so thought it would go away. 20 minutes into my drive home It was still rock hard and swollen. So I got worried and called the on-call plastic surgery resident. I had my surgery done at a academic university hospital, so residents are on-call over night and weekends. I explained what happened and sent this picture. He immediately said, get home and have someone drive me to the ER ASAP. He determined from my symptoms and picture that I had developed a hematoma (bleeding in the pocket). So all that swelling was blood collecting under the muscle. I get to the ER and he arranges to have me back in the bed pretty quick. He starts telling me the plan and that he walking over to the OR to reserve OR for surgery. Another hard-headed move üòÖ I asked if we can do the surgery later in the afternoon the next day since I had a meeting in the morning üòÇ. His response was ‚ÄúI dont think you understand the seriousness of this. You are borderline Urgent needing surgery in the next few hours, and emergent needing surgery now‚Äù. I was stable enough that surgery was scheduled a few hours after I got to the ER. They had to open the right side again, take out the implant, an wash out the pocket. They found that I had somehow tore a blood vessel in the pocket where all the blood was coming from.  Post-op hematoma is a somewhat fairly common complication, it happens to some people but can be avoided had I taken it easy. Now I am on a one month medical leave because of my bad choices and eagerness to get back to work. Moral of the story, listen to your surgeon, your body, and take it easy. let you body heal :)

This was literally my biggest fear, I fell in my shower like day 4 and I was terrified I&#39;d popped my implant or torn something.

Aww sorry that happened. We humans are just so busy with our lives we sometimes forget to just be careful and take it easy. even though we just had surgery.

But being serious, I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that, it sounds awful. And thank you for sharing your experience to warn others. Hope you recover well and they can put in a new implant soon.

They were able to put it back in right after the washout thankfully. I needed to have a drain in for a week to drain out any more blood or fluid that would accumulate. My surgeon said that I got lucky bc sometimes they do have to keep the implant out and replace it another time
