anatomically, the surgery line is where it should be. you seem to be wearing your bottoms too low on the waist, making it appear much higher.
</p>
<p>
that being said, i’m sorry that there wasn’t any meaningful aesthetic work done. perhaps try looking into canadian doctors who might be able to assist in vaginal reconstruction and see what they can do for you under your insurance!

The scar is 2 inches higher than the other side bikini line , just a joke surgery done and Canada is not like the US Insurance it’s pure Government Health care with minimal experience in these matters , all these surgeries in Canada except SRS doing a vintage 70 year old  PI and BA is all you get here  , nothing else - they wanted me to do pelvic floor therapy when the canal needed completely re-doing girth and length - The Vancouver Gender Clinic don’t know there butts from a hole in the ground - the main surgeon who I needed to talk to was quashed by Genoway because it went against her so called expertise and she’s the front line cosmetic plastic surgeon , what she says goes , she’s not a Urological surgeon , everything I wanted done refused basically because it has to be paid for by Government Canadian Insurance paid by the public funds - The Urological Surgeon actually doing the PI surgery nothiing else ( No options here ) started out as an Electrical Engineer for some years , jumped ship became a doctor then surgeon - No fk’ing way I’m having an Ex Electrical Engineer doing surgery on me , not a chance - the Sigmoid Canal got fixed now from Theerapong being functional but our Canadian doctors are tooooo ! Stupid to know this - so I travel and pay out of pocket - Plastic surgery doesn’t include having a scar 2 inches different from the other side , it was sh#t surgery more and likely from the second surgeon doing the harvesting of the colon segment -smoke’n angry at stupidity , bad enough I went to Kamol twice before like an idiot !

Going to echo: The incision looks to be in the right spot. Is it perfectly symmetrical? Naw, probably not.
</p>
<p>
My GCS scars aren&#39;t either. The good news: Symmetry doesn&#39;t exist in nature, and it would be weird if we were all super symmetrical.
</p>
<p>
Also: two inches... If anyone is going to be picky about your two inches there, they can fuck off, and you seem the type not afraid to tell them.
</p>
<p>
I know complications personally. My canal is non-functional. My aesthetics are ... Not great.
</p>
<p>
I also don&#39;t turn to attacks on &#39;trans wokeness&#39; and &#39;new age trans&#39;.
</p>
<p>
We are all trans.
</p>
<p>
The only big differences that I would note (and be proud of): You have better meds, better science, and better surgeries available.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!
</p>
<p>
Try to be less entitled in your posts, and you might get better responses.

Knock on wood that because the vagina is inside your body cosmetics are not important , FUNCTIONAL ABILITY is key and appears to so far not to be too bad post op , it works anyways after an  11 hour surgery and a blood transfusion to boot !- you have realize I never got an actual consultation , the day before I did get a physical exam with Dr. Theerapong and he had 4 other very young assistants and one from Siam - I needed to talk to him one on one without all the extra riff raff hanging around and not being on the same page - The surgery itself is serious surgery really and when a doctor doesn’t even talk to you in anyway one on one , this is not a good surgery scenario , I paid 24k via Siam - I’ve since been blacklisted in reality post op now “ The saving face “ situation Interplast has dried up completely for communication - he tried to externally using soluble stitches for cosmetic distinction looks of labia and these stitches never held - I new before I left it was screwed - what I needed was a full second surgery a vulva Plasty/labia plasty 10 days later to really fix aesthetics and was never talked about pre surgery nothing ? - what gets me is every other patient I’ve read on Reddit about him are happy that he was very kind , a sweet man and took the time with a personal 1 hour consult showing diagrams what he would do during the personal  consult I never got with him - I spent a lot of money 24k Canadian plus 4 1/2K to fly Business class almost 30k and end up with a cosmetic mess all over again like Kamol’s crap mess aesthetically I got back in 2019 - Like the Japanese “ Saving Face “ once they feel insulted you won’t get get anywhere with them post op - I don’t think I was over expecting results aesthetically ? it just wasn’t done in reality ! but bottom line he did a shitty job aesthetically quite frankly and my images are proof post op 9 months - so I’m screwed all over again and once you complain your done - Interplast will not respond , never has really ?

Yeah this sort of thing is literally exactly the reason I never went abroad, and never would for future surgeries.
</p>
<p>
If something goes wrong you just have no recourse or practical solutions. Not to mention peripheral issues like travel/effect on recovery, communication/language issues and adding about a thousand other variables.

Well , I could never go up from the smallest Soul Source Purple dilator and after a year realized it was joke surgery, I had maybe 5 inches depth originally, diameter was the biggest issue ? External Scrotal Penile skin is not designed to be a vaginal canal bottom line but it’s done because it’s the simplest outside going in the body surgery from 70 plus years ago that doesn’t require hard core major Urological surgery to create a Neo Vagina ! , now at least I can just taking 5 minutes getting the Soul Source largest Orange dilator in with no pain some lube  and it gos in 7 and a bit plus inches so I’m finally functional after 4 years - stay away from Kamol he’s not as good as there BS online website says they are !! Sigmoid is a ready made tubular bowel segment guaranteed - PPT they have to make an “egg roll “ sutured together and attached to the outer Scrotal PI skin going in  , it’s too thin a tissue in my biased books  , it stretches because PPT is a thin tissue to begin with but nothing like Sigmoid ready to go from your bowels so I’m totally Biased been there did the Scrotal PI BS ! - a bowel segment can be cut 7 inches and it’s not going to shrink or loose it’s ability to stretch and the tissue is tough as hell !

You are correct about Dr. Theerapong in that he’s good at doing Sigmoid colon canal revisions - aesthetically I’m proof he’s more than lacking on aesthetic revisions but a 1 st time surgery SRS 100% better than Kamol could ever be and yes Kamol is not doing SRS from beginning to end surgery like he used to do , stay away from Kamol !! - go to Kunaporn or Theerapong for a far more superior outcome I feel and minimal revisions if any post op - Theerapong’s aesthetics suck post op unfortunately but at least I’m vaginally functional finally !

I was 4 years and not actually functional in reality and I’m an old guard Transwoman now of 65 , despite my age I wanted to be functional whether I have sex physically or not - why have SRS surgery if you can’t be functional sexually , it’s part of being “ Female “ men have penis’s and women have vaginas , pretty simple really - post op it’s a real disservice for a person mentally if a doctor does not make you functional and just pockets your money to have only a flat looking crotch , what’s the point then ? of having any SRS surgery if it’s not functional ?- go to Theerapong or Kunaporn so you can be functional  like any other woman , stay away from Kamol !

Relax and make the right  decision now , you know Kamol is not the one to go to , the Politics at Kamol’s board run Hospital are not good , Your Not The Only One with fk’d up surgery on planet Earth from many poor surgeons unfortunately doing SRS , take your  time and all will be ok - talk with Saphira ( Meredith ) at “Amani” , she lives in Bangkok an Ex US patriot helping Transwomen get the help needed specifically Dr. Theerapong and also Dr. kunaporn
