Just a slight happy and at the same time worryed rant.
</p>
<p>
I had surgery at the start of the year, and so far the sensitibity of my clit has been quite low... But! Theese days it seems that my nerves have been reconnecting at top speed (that acompanied by the feeling of getting tassered right in the cooch)
</p>
<p>
It seems to be quite more senssitive now, and im quite happy. But at the same time im a bit scared of touching myself, because if it ends up still not being enough for me to orgasm or even have fun with it im gonna get dysphoric af and i reeeeally don&#39;t wanna deal with that...
</p>
<p>
Im also on SSRI&#39;s since one month ago, and it really does not help
</p>
<p>
Well, at least it loos awesome :v

SSRIs nuke the libido. You&#39;re gonna want to get off those if you want to properly try your new equipment.

More so they make it super hard to achieve climax. Speaking from experience.

I&#39;ve been on several SSRIs before. Some altered my sensitivity, and some didn&#39;t.
