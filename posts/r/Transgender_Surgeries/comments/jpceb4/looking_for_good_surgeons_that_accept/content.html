That is correct most wont cover ffs unless you work for apple or starbucks. Which is sad cause i would argue ffs is more important than srs as your face is how you present to the world... i would love to get ffs but i doubt i will ever be able to afford it

Whether or not your insurance will pay for it all comes down to the medical coding. If your doctor doesn&#39;t have it coded as elective, it may have a higher chance of success.
</p>
<p>
&#34;It was a necessary reconstructive procedure.&#34;

Hopefully this doesn&#39;t come off as terribly trite given the context, but I sometimes like to tell people that getting a part time job as Starbucks can be surprisingly worth it for some things. It&#39;s a lot better than a lot of other retail jobs, the benefits can be fantastic and the tips are quite good. When I worked there I had to keep my hours below a certain point for insurance reasons, but I still qualified for a ton of pretty useful stuff. Just a thought.

The benefits in relieving gd are greater from SRS than FFS. How you think about yourself matters way more than how other people think about you

Depends on the person. Some may find what they see in the mirror each morning more important than their genitals.

But with genitals it’s not what you see, it’s your very nature as a human being

All your experiences in life are different after srs

My genitals are not my very nature as a human being and I don’t think it is a healthy perspective. Each person should decide what’s important to them. While I want to have a feminine face and genitals, my face is more important to me (me, not for others).

The same I would say about our faces. We are more that just how we look but dysphoria manifests it&#39;s self differently in different people. I want ffs but srs is more important for me and I&#39;m trying to get that first.

Jesus, I&#39;d hate to see how you&#39;d react when you find out that there&#39;s a decent number of trans folks who don&#39;t want bottom surgery at all. And speaking as someone who very much needed GRS and would go through it all over again if I had to: my life and my sense of self (and self-worth) is not defined by my genitals. My &#34;very nature as a human being&#34; is determined by my morals and ethics and how I treat other people, not what&#39;s been my legs. To imply otherwise is ridiculously reductive and, frankly, kinda fucking insulting.

SRS made me more comfortable with myself, ffs made me more comfortable around others
</p>
<p>
Absolutely neither were optional, and there would be no way of saying which was more important.  Though I&#39;m glad I got ffs first bc it was easier to deal with my own thoughts than words and stares from others.

I had a consult with
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/ffs/usa#wiki_sheldon_lincenberg" rel="nofollow">Sheldon Lincenberg
</a>
in Atlanta, GA this year for FFS, here&#39;s my experience.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Sheldon Lincenberg (Caucasian) showed me (Caucasian) some pictures of his results with transgender patients. He showed some African American women and said some hateful, racist things about them; he also consistently misgendered his trans women patients, saying things like &#34;...and he - sorry, I mean she. Anyway, he...&#34;. His office staff was very friendly and did not misgender me or anyone else in my hearing.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Dr. Lincenberg and office staff reported my insurance would likely cover at least some procedures but if so Dr. Lincenberg would be unwilling to do all procedures in one surgery because he could get more insurance reimbursement by separating surgeries out over several days or weeks. He admitted this would lengthen my healing period.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to consider him despite all that, here&#39;s the procedures he recommended and rough prices he quoted me in USD:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Browlift, lifting/tightening forehead skin:
<ul>
<li>
$6500
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Rhinoplasty:
<ul>
<li>
$6200
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Cheek lift, filing in the area under lower eyelid, lifting cheek pad, smoothing folds around mouth:
<ul>
<li>
$6200
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Blepharoplasty, removing excess skin/fat from eyelids:
<ul>
<li>
$5800
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Neck lift, removing under chin fat:
<ul>
<li>
$5000
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Jaw contouring:
<ul>
<li>
$4500
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Lip filler:
<ul>
<li>
$3500
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Rhytidectomy, chin contouring:
<ul>
<li>
$3300
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Everything all told, with operating room, anesthesia, and other fees:
<ul>
<li>
$55,000
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Not sure about FFS, but there are a number of them that accept medicare in FL, and would most likely accept GA medicaid due to the proximity.  Choose a university affiliated Surgeon, as they&#39;ll be more likely to take medicare.
