So I‚Äôm finally home and thought it was time for an update.
</p>
<p>
Swelling has gone down a lot and all in all I‚Äôve had a very smooth run of recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π  Apart from some minor wound separation at the base first night out of hospital which freaked me out and some difficulty dilating (will go into more detail about that in a moment) everything has been fairly good! I‚Äôm moving and walking, albeit slower and shorter distances than normal, pain only spikes from time to time and is well controlled with prescription meds and paracetamol/ibuprofen.
</p>
<p>
Now‚Ä¶ dilating  This is the place I‚Äôve had some minor issues, but also some major success. I was circumcised and small to start with so even with PPV Hart warned I likely may have depth issues. Pre-surgery Hart says on average his patients have 13-14cm (5.12-5.51in) of depth with PPV but the range (excluding complications and stopping dilation) is 9-20cm (3.55-7.87in) though most larger canals settle to around 15cm long term unless dilation of that depth is actually perused ongoing or is in semi regular use to that depth. He also warns that in the early days fluctuations of 1-3cm depending on swelling are normal, and to document ongoing depth to make sure loss isn‚Äôt a pattern.
</p>
<p>
Upon first dilating in hospital I was very much on the lower end of this, even with external swelling making the canal look deeper from the outside, I was only 9-9.5cm (3.55-3.74in) or 3.5-4 dots visible on the soul source dilator. This was the case when Hart dilated me in hospital and for the remaining ones in hospital.
</p>
<p>
I won‚Äôt lie, I was a little upset. I knew this was a likely outcome considering the factors outlined before but it was an unfortunate reality. Or so I thought!
</p>
<p>
Through the advice I had learnt here of slow, consistent pressure and pelvic floor exercises I had decided to see how far I could push myself in these early stages while the tissue was most malleable and immature to gain as much depth as possible. One of the great benefits of peritoneal tissue, particularly that which is kept to its blood supply and not a graft, is that it is has the ability to stretch a lot more than some other forms of tissue used for surgery.
</p>
<p>
So that‚Äôs what I did, I tried to push myself a little further each dilation, just a few millimetres. Nothing extreme or dangerous and always listening to my body if there was pain that was more than discomfort I would pull back. Little by little I‚Äôve seen results and omg looking back have they added up! As of tonight‚Äôs dilation (my 33rd) my depth is up to ü•Åü•Åü•Å
</p>
<p>
14cm! That is a 5cm or 55% improvement over my original depth! I am both shocked, amazed and so very happyü•∞ I know this is one of the more extreme examples of canal growth and I only feel like it‚Äôs possible due to an aligning of many factors, but I wanted to share to show that canal depth increasing - particularly in the very early stages - can be achieved
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm avoiding posting photos at this time but if anyone here is considering Hart and would like to see please feel free to reach out and I can share privately.
</p>
<p>
As usual any questions please feel free to comment them or message me and I‚Äôm always happy to answerüíñ

First I&#39;ve heard anyone gaining depth although reading &amp; research suggests it is possible but to that extreme, that&#39;s cool.
</p>
<p>
Glad you had good success with your GCS :) curious do you know if they did the PPT flap? You mentioned that they were able to keep the blood supply rather than grafting and IMHO this is  MUCH better, that means the nerves are also intact I believe?
</p>
<p>
I have no idea what surgeon I&#39;ll have; that&#39;s way down the road probably not for another couple of years after I change doctors and get all the specialists I need to see and get to a healthier weight as I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a requirement or they won&#39;t even do the surgery if above a certain BMI.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just hoping to be able to feel the vaginal lining; I don&#39;t believe that would be the best if the peritoneal lining was grafted.  Is that the case with yours since you have intact blood flow?
