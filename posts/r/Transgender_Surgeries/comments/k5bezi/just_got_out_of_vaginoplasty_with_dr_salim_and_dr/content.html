Update day 3 post-op. I’m doing really well! I’ve been going for 20-30 minute walks on my own every 4 hours. And I just had a bowel movement this morning. The pain is surprisingly manageable and I’m off the IV completely. I cried happy tears in bed this morning, just getting to see and feel my new body.

Since I’m curious and this was roughly a year ago, how have things gone? What are your thoughts? Would you recommend your surgeon?

Wow good timing. I’m actually just out of a revision surgery with him and team. There were some complications the first time around that needed to be addressed. Honestly the aftercare from the Kaiser team leaves a LOT to be desired. I felt both times that after the surgery was done I became way less of a priority to them.
</p>
<p>
It’s very common with this surgery to see wound separation and I had this happen in one place specifically about a week out from my first surgery. This led to healing that wasn’t optimal for the final result looks-wise. I think I may have been ok with this alone but I also had issues with too little clitoral hooding and the positioning of my urethra. So I went in for a revision two weeks ago and… surprise surprise I’m seeing wound separation again in the same place. So the final look is not going to be “perfect” but honesty I knew this going in.
</p>
<p>
I had pretty realistic expectations going in with Dr. Salim/Thomas and team, and I still feel like they dropped the ball on the aftercare. I honestly don’t know if it’s just my body reacting weirdly to stitches or if there was more care I could’ve received to address the issue earlier? According to Dr. Salim, he can’t go and just stitch it back up once the wound has separated because of the risk of infection or further tissue damage so I don’t know… I think it’s a risky surgery no matter what.
</p>
<p>
DM me if you want to chat more. Overall I think I received “adequate” results. I just wish I didn’t have to go in for the revision. But I do think I’ll be very happy with everything once it heals up. Functionality is very good otherwise!

Congrats! Let us know how it heals. I&#39;m curious about other girls results from them because mine turned out mostly ok. But there are some issues that are making me consider a revision. I&#39;d like to know they&#39;ve gotten better over the last few years.

Curious: how did dilation go for you? I’m a week post-op and having almost no trouble getting right up to the beginning of the last dot. Feeling optimistic but I also want to have some realistic expectations!

I started out being able to go up to almost dot 4 but now I&#39;m only at dot 3. I was never able to get as far as you. probably a good sign for your progress. For me, blue can go almost to 4 still, but orange is always 3 at best.

Mainly cosmetic... the labia minora is barely there, the hood over my clitoris didn&#39;t fuse properly so it looks like it has a slit in it when I open my legs. Honestly the front view when standing is great but when you get up close... not so much. I think they left too much erectile tissue, and I can feel a subtle &#39;bulging&#39; above the vaginal cavity when I&#39;m aroused. It makes me a little dysphoric and makes penetration more difficult by kind of closing the vagina off.  I also have a small issue with depth and sex is uncomfortable/painful sometimes. Especially if the guy I&#39;m dating is any larger than average. Dr. Salim declined to do a revision for me and I get it. It&#39;s not like the problems are super apparent. And none of these things is especially bad. But I still think I&#39;d like to have them fixed.

Makes sense. Are you overall happy with your result? For me, I feel like as long as I can pee and orgasm and accommodate a penis/strap on I’ll be happy!

Yeah. I&#39;m like 75% satisfied. I&#39;m obviously still very happy that I did it. Just want a little improvement, you know?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s 1000x better now than before, especially in terms of dysphoria. Life is so much easier without tucking. Clothes fit correctly. No more being terrified to use the locker room at the gym. Sex is better. Dating is easier. You&#39;ll be seriously happier than you&#39;ve ever been. :-)

That’s so nice to hear. Since I got my first glimpse of myself down there I’m already feeling soooo validated. I respect the ladies who don’t need to get this surgery, but for me I think it’s going to do so much for my self image

That sounds like a lot. On what grounds did he deny you a revision?

I haven&#39;t even been able to see Dr. Salim in like 2 years. The last time I saw him was at my 12 month follow-up visit. When I told him I was thinking about a revision he looked at me like I was crazy. I guess this is about as good as he could do cosmetically? Every time I&#39;ve tried to broach the subject via email, I only hear from Chris, the PA (who is super nice and usually quite helpful, despite not being who I want to talk to) who tells me to just keep trying to get used to stretching more via dilation. I don&#39;t think they get that stretching has limits...
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s super annoying and frustrating. But as I posted about my FFS, Kaiser is TERRIBLE when it comes to trying to get surgical revisions. It&#39;s a whole, fucked up convoluted process if your surgeon declines to do one.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d push harder, but I was focused on dealing with my FFS revision first. Now I think my best option is to do a PPT and a minor cosmetic revision with Dr. Wittenberg. I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s possible to get more depth without a PPT so it doesn&#39;t make sense to try to get just a cosmetic revision if I can have all the issues addressed in one surgery anyway. I can get coverage to see her through a different insurance company so it&#39;s just not worth it to me to stay with Kaiser anymore or get a second opinion or fight through the appeals process. Getting a revision with her will likely be easier than trying to convince Dr. Salim

It&#39;s not so bad. Like I said, I&#39;m mostly fine with how my GCS turned out. And I&#39;m not sure if he could actually fix all the issues anyway. I don&#39;t even know if adding more depth is possible without a PPT, and he doesn&#39;t do that surgery.

I’m in some pain and the catheter is suuuper uncomfortable. But I got to see myself down there last night and I just keep looking at the pic and it makes me smile a big smile every time ☺️

It seems like we all have such different experiences! I’m mostly just bored and kind of uncomfortable from the catheter at this point...
