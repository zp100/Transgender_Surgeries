I&#39;m about a year on hrt via informed consent, and soon I&#39;ll be going to a doctor to start the process of getting approved for surgery through Medi[-Cal. I want to go to Bowers, but she doesn&#39;t take any medicare insurance. And I&#39;ve heard she is not as good as the media and a lot of people make her out to be, that because she did the surgery for I Am Jazz lots of people give her undue praise. I&#39;m thinking about Dr Satterwhite because I&#39;ve heard a some good things about him, and his practice accepts Medi-Cal. But I just haven&#39;t heard enough about him or his practice and results. I know not everyone looks the same, so I&#39;m not expecting a PSP(Porn Star P****), but obviously I don&#39;t want it to look like Texas  chainsaw massacre down there either. Functionality and sensation are the two most important factors for me. How does his results in those departments compare to other surgeons like Bowers or Mcginn? How does he treat his patients?
</p>
<p>
The biggest thing and the one that has given me the most grief the past couple weeks is complications. I scrolled through posts on this sub just today ans saw a slew of dissatisfied trans women who had unsatisfactory results or major complications that resulted in or could have resulted in disablement or death. I get that there is always a risk whenever you go under the knife, but I don&#39;t want to get surgery done, be discharged, and find out that there was some complication later that could have been avoided or fixed before damage was done. I saw someone say that her FFS caused a stroke due to medical malpractice and general mistreatment of trans individuals in the medical field. Obviously different surgeries, but that terrifies the hell out of me. I rely heavily on my motor functions, and if something happened to them because I went to a surgeon that just didn&#39;t care, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to go on living. I couldn&#39;t live the rest of my life being handicapped, especially if I knew that the only reason I was handicapped in the first place was due to a surgeon not doing their job.
</p>
<p>
So, with all that, do you think Satterwhite is a good choice? Do you have a recommendation for another surgeon? If you have had srs done, how were your results and experience? It&#39;s a super important decision, and I&#39;d rather pay thousands and be in dept than go cheap and ruin my chances at happiness. Thank you for any advice or recommendations.

Dr Satterwhite just did my FFS revision  and I have nothing but positive things to say. This is how it should have been done the first time.
</p>
<p>
Not to mention he just seems like a good and kind person in general. He has a lot of skill and he&#39;s honest. He made no promises about correcting my Type III because he thought that after 3-4 years the original titanium screws might have become inoperable. He didn&#39;t do the first surgery, so he didn&#39;t know exactly what to expect. Fortunately that wasn&#39;t the case and I ended up with even better results on my forehead than I was hoping for.

I went to Dr. Satterwhite&#39;s partner, Dr. Gurjala. He did both my bottom surgery and my FFS. Both are excellent surgeons and wonderful people. I also know a number of girls that went to one or the other and all are satisfied with their results. I am happy to answer any questions.

Did you have any complications or scares? How did he deal with that? And did he try to educate you beforehand?

I had a very minor complication for my SRS, but it was related to how I heal and not the procedure. Basically I had some fat in the area die while I was healing and it caused some swelling and drainage. I had no wound separation or any of the scary complications.
</p>
<p>
They have great post support. The physician&#39;s assistant continually checks in with you through the recovery process. When I realized I was swelling, I contacted her and sent pictures. She told me it was not a thing to be concerned about. This was again confirmed when I went in a couple days later for a scheduled follow up.
</p>
<p>
They also send you for hyperbaric therapy at a nearby center. I found this really speeds the healing process.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Gurjala will spend as much time as needed to answer all your questions. He also really listens to your concerns and makes sure he addresses all of them.

That&#39;s great! Not the complication obviously, just the fact that you were able to communicate with them so easily. If you don&#39;t mind answering, how was you sensation afterwards? Do you think he did a good job in trying to maintain as much as possible?

I thought my sensation was great a few days post op, but it kept improving. It is definitely great now. I think he did a fantastic job. I love the way it works and looks. I actually started crying when I first saw it.

Aww I bet that feeling was amazing. I hope my feelings afterwards are similar. I&#39;ve just heard some people being super dysphoric post op.

I have heard of that, but all the girls I know were pretty thrilled. Even when I first woke up I was very happy.

Hi, I went to Dr. Gurjala as well for my bottom surgery, and I love my results! If I can ask, how do you feel about your FFS with him? I’m curious about your experience, as I don’t know anyone who’s gone to him for it before, all my friends went to Satterwhite.

He did a great job for me. He did a brow lift and forehead reconstruction, lip lift, rhinoplasty and fat graphs from my cheeks and lips. I love the result. I just went in for a minor revision and also had him do my chin. I really think he&#39;s one of the best out there.

I went to Dr. Gurujal for my GCS back in January. He is Dr. Satterwhite’s practice partner. Align Surgical had great aftercare. I think my surgery went really well and I particularly liked that this clinic uses a wound vacuum for GCS. I’m two months post op and still continue to talk with the nurses from that clinic via FaceTime and email.

Dr. Satterwhite is in the business for the right reasons as he is part of the lgbt family.   I’ve heard nothing but good things about him.  That said, with any surgeon bottom surgery almost always has complicatioms, mostly minor, but some serious.   You have to be prepared for possibility going into the process.
