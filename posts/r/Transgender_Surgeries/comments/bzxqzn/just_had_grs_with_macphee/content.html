Ask me some questions if you would like to ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in great spirits, little pain and I saw what it looks like and can&#39;t wait to see how it looks after I heal up ðŸ˜Š she did a good job
</p>
<p>
Also eating like a queen on my insurance&#39;s dime which is nice!
</p>
<p>
Edit
</p>
<p>
So just to expand a bit on how I chose her etc
</p>
<p>
Waiting time for the surgery was about 8 months
</p>
<p>
$500 down payment to book for the surgery
</p>
<p>
My insurance covered hospital costs and is going to reimburse me for the surgeon&#39;s fee
</p>
<p>
I specifically requested a more realistic looking labia at the cost of vaginal depth (I&#39;m lesbian) and was still able to achieve 5&#34; of depth
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d heard lots of good things about her and she also did my trachea shave last year. I was really impressed with her abilities as a surgeon and her dedication to our community
</p>
<p>
I may be willing to share pics privately after healing is further along for those interested in going to her and her &#34;half depth&#34; option for GRS

Really just tried to make sure I knew what I was getting into. I didn&#39;t realize the extent to which I would end up disabled but everything else so far is as I expected. I&#39;m actually glad I have a catheter in because otherwise peeing as much as I am would be a nightmare
</p>
<p>
Just try not to over think or stress on things. I feel like the outlook I had coming in has helped me stay positive

Like I didn&#39;t realize how hard getting around would be after surgery. If you&#39;ve never been through something like this before, be aware even the smallest movements end up being difficult
</p>
<p>
Like it just feels like my abdomen to my thighs are filled with cement. I can move my arms, head and feet but everything else is a struggle

It might be a YMMV thing since some girls report being able to function just fine after one month or so. That said, surgeons worth of anything will usually recommend taking it easy for at least 3 months (which is my plan).

I had mine with her 7 weeks ago and after the cath comes out you will be a lot more mobile! I walked a mile in steps the first day leaving her office but it was a bit much. I basically walk each day until i start to ache and then lay down.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€™s tiring for a while, the process of changing your underwear and pads is so draining until the cath comes out but it gets better quickly. I was going around town with friends a little after 2 weeks

Did your vaginal packing eventually make you feel like you constantly have to poop?

The very last day before it was removed i felt intensely constipated but i was okay until then and wasnâ€™t aware of it. I didnâ€™t realize it was the packing until she removed it. I can honestly say my most miserable night was the night before it was removed so take your fiber!
</p>
<p>
That was my only slip. I ate pretty bad the first week, mostly restaurants, and forgot to buy fiber pills until it was too late. My fresh fruit ran out after the 2nd day and ordering out was easier then the store so donâ€™t do what i did lol

I am definitely interested in going to her for redoing my plumbing.. Do you know what the cost is if I have no insurance? Also I need more information on &#34;half depth option&#34;?? Please share

I think my quote was around $19k for everything, but it&#39;s more expensive if you use credit
</p>
<p>
Half depth gets you a slightly less deep vagina so that she can focus more on the vulva&#39;s appearance. In my case it was about 2 in less but I will have labia minora and majora which some neo vaginas don&#39;t have or don&#39;t have as much detail as a cis woman&#39;s would
</p>
<p>
Edit I should add having less depth also makes recovery easier and dilating less time consuming. Since I don&#39;t plan on having penetrative sex but still want sex partners to be able to use fingers/mouths on me down there, it was the perfect option for me

Thank You Hon! The information was very helpful. My problem is that I enjoy penetration as a per-op. I guess I need to make a decision whether I want a better appearance or deeper depth.. Do you know if all SRS Docs give you that option?

I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by that cost!
</p>
<p>
Several years ago I had consultations with her for BA and FFS (and not vaginoplasty only because she wasn&#39;t doing that at the time.) I lived in the area so really wanted her to work out but her cost was just so much more than any of the half dozen others with whom I consulted then, to the point that even the added cost of travel overseas and lodging would be less. The difference appeared to be that the hospital she was using then had very high fees.

Yeah the hospital fee was half the cost, but they were in network with my insurance. If I had financed it 100% cash Co pay I would have had to wait another 2 years to make it happen

Gotcha. My insurance to date has always excluded trans coverage so I was having to pay out of pocket. For FFS she came in at $26k while everyone else (US and oversees) were $14k-19k (and the $19k one was including some things the others didn&#39;t.)

FWIW I feel that she&#39;s a very talented surgeon and may be worth the extra cost. She did my trachea shave and the scar is completely unnoticeable and I&#39;m sure my recovery for GRS will go well because of her

I did not feel she was by comparison of her FFS results (several of whom were local friends) compared to the results of other surgeons. Not that her results were bad, simply that they were comparable so it would have been paying far more for the same results. For me it meant only FFS vs FFS of the same quality and getting BA.

They never expressed any regrets. The only photos I was aware of were the ones she had in her album for in-person consultations, and 3 of the 4 people in it at the time were friends (little surprise since I lived in that area.)
