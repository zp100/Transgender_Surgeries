Hi,I was about to visit Dr Marc Arnkoff to get my orchiectomy done, but he stopped taking patients yesterday (Jan 19, 2022). I&#39;m looking to find a different surgeon (urologist?) who could perform a bilateral orchiectomy, and who is pretty well reviewed. I&#39;d prefer someone in NYC or Boston, but I&#39;m willing to travel around the US.

I called his office and they said he is no longer taking patients. He recommended some other doctors in the area which I could list for you, but I was going to go to Michigan just for him. I don&#39;t really care to see anyone else near him.

I should have gotton reviews before my urologist butchured me exactly 1 year ago. But lucky I found Dr. Boris Volshteyn. 732-641-3350. Plastic Surgeon in West Long Branch, NJ. Closer to NYC

Whaaaaaaat? Nooooo! I was going to text him tomorrow morning, but found your post just now. I&#39;m wanting to get the orchie specifically
<em>
for
</em>
HRT - I want to avoid high doses of E and don&#39;t want to take spiro. I&#39;m trying to find someone that can do it with little or no wait - I&#39;m planning to start HRT in the 2nd week of Feb.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I should have my first letter in about a week, and I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll have a 2nd letter within a week or two after that.
