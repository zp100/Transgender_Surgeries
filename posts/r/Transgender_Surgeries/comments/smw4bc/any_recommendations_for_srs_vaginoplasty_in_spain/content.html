Ivan Mañero, the result in his webpage are amazing, there&#39;s not much info on Reddit about him though.

He’s a butcher. I’m from Spain and most of the girls here that had surgery with him are botched. I don’t recommend him at all

No, they don’t use Reddit, also they don’t feel comfortable at all posting public photos. Of course you can chose not to trust me, that’s your decision, but I can tell you what happened and you can make your own conclusions: they had colon vaginoplasty (in which Ivan specialises) and they had terrible results in labia, their vaginal cavity had prolapse and they have colon tissue hanging out of the entrance. Also most of them don’t feel nothing in the cavity and labia, only in clitoris and is not as pleasurable as before.
</p>
<p>
Actually, there is a link I could give you. A friend of mine did an interview in her YouTube Chanel to a girl who had colon vaginoplasty with him, and she was botched, but its in Spanish, if you know the language I can give it to you.
</p>
<p>
Also, there was a teenage girl who had colon vaginoplasty with him and she almost died in the surgery, she lost a lot of blood and Ivan took her to a private hospital to take care of her (since his clinic wasn’t prepared for that) and she survived, but was in terrible conditions and with botched genitals. The brother of the girl tried to sue him and  put a bad review of him in google (I think) but he couldn’t do much about it and he ended up paying like the 30.000 euros that the vaginoplasty costed plus 20.000 euros more because of the complications and the expenses of the other hospital. Ivan didn’t took responsibility at all.
</p>
<p>
As I said, you cannot trust me if you want. I think the review is not there anymore since Ivan took it, but the interview is on YouTube and if you go to the instagram page of IM GENDER a lot of trans women put bad comments about their bad results with him.
</p>
<p>
Btw, he also offers penile inversion method but must of the girls were convinced by him to do colon vaginoplasty, even if they were ideal to make the PI which is less invasive than colon vaginoplasty because he said to them: “it is better to have 20cm than 15cm of depth with the penile skin, you will be here asking for more depth after you recover from PI” (in my opinion he does that to gain more money since colon vaginoplasty is almost the double of PI in hice clinic)
</p>
<p>
Now, most of the girls despite a strict dilating regime have like one inch depth with the colon tissue hanging out of their vaginas. So it was all for nothing. Plus, the girl from the interview said that when she had the complication, one of the nurses said to her: “well, if we tell that these things can happen none of those girls would come with him to do the surgery”…
</p>
<p>
Ah, I forgot to say that some of them had fistulas with him if I remember correctly (but not sure of this anyway)
</p>
<p>
So, after knowing that, do what you want. I don’t have a lot of proof but I trust the girls, so if you decide to go with him anyways thats on you and I wish you the best of lucks ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Thanks. If you know of any other non-English YouTube videos about surgeons please let me know and I&#39;ll add them to the wiki here. I probably have most of the English ones already.

Hi, thanks for the info I was actually considering him. Do you have any opinions on Dr. Jesus Lago from Madrid? I was also considering him.

He seems to place the vaginal canal below the inner labia which is anatomically incorrect.
