Yeah that isn&#39;t textbook vulvar anatomy by any means, your surgeon is also notorious for being a horrible surgeon.
</p>
<p>
Whichever surgeons are telling you this, are lying to you. I&#39;m not trying to be mean, just being honest.

Honesty is what I am searching for , I just wish the surgeons in this field could at least pretend that’s what they are looking for also .... thank you for your honesty ❤️

It&#39;s not textbook anatomy and does look a little odd.
</p>
<p>
That being said, I&#39;m not a surgeon but I think it would be fairly straight forward to improve with a revision. The clitoral structure looks good, the positioning of the vaginal canal looks good, you just need some debulking of the tissue around the urethra and to have the urethral opening lowered. Perhaps the extra tissue could be used for labia minora?

I have no clitoris , it appears that way in the photo and also this nasty evil surgeon gave me the penile skin at the tip as a clitoral skin which is in no way normal. It is all flat there with absolutely no clit . Also the big bulge is all erectile tissue which obviously was left alone and means my dorsal nerves were never excised . I am in pain for 6 years every day of my life . I have a huge amount of hair inside , I have the location of what appears to be a clitoris 3 inches higher than normal . When I stand up it is on the top of my pubic bone area / lowest point of abdomen .I could go on and on and now I need an illiolingiunal and peritoneal nerve specialist but no drs surgeon will allow them to work beside them . Dr miroslav has clearly said in emails that this can never be made right . Dr ting in the same facility says he can fix everything . Dr blue bond says she will not help me because I do not identify as transgender .( why the heck would I after all of this ? I could go on and on ..... I have contacted every teaching university and otherwise in America and all have worked only towards getting a rise out of me . These people are evil times 10 and they all have received this photo to then conclude I am just not happy with the result . Sick !

The entire team at my Sinai was only being used by the department of deffense ! Ting can’t get out of his own megalomaniacal shame long enough to help ever since I caught him bowers and Scott Seskin ( the attorney ) dragging out statue of limitations . Because I don’t trust medicine any more ( AT ALL) I wanted honesty , and because I was looking for honesty I was absolutely demoralized by the transgender lie system of compassion ! Ting refuses to see me now that he won’t even tell me wether or not my outcome was done correctly and or if the outcome is different than normal vulvar anatomy .

I have young children , any coincidence ( I wonder ) how Japan passed laws saying parents like me can’t have this surgery ? I wonder a lot now . I have devoted every waking and sleeping hour for seek years seeking the compassionate system of transgender that everyone pretends exists . It does not if we are not part of the club !!! Such evil simply to remove patient bill of rights while everyone slept and or was dying to get help . Should I then go to a doctor that refuses to have surgeons involved outside of his specialty even when they are absolutely critical to achieving success ? Ting and all others only wanted this empire to service illegals and experiment for the dod on the population under the guise of us doj civil rights protections ...... the day I find some basic respect and honesty from any doctor in this field is the day they remove my falsified medical record that all are agreeing with that my surgical outcome is entirely within normal parameters of female genitalia . I could go on .....please do tell me if you would go to doctors that can’t even determine if this outcome is wrong ? They refuse to even answer me as to if they have reconstructed and repositioned clitoral nerve bundle into a normal anatomical position instead of 3 inches to high . Again ... I could go on

I can’t sue her ! No doctor any where will conclude this surgery was done incorrectly . Marci bowers was going to but was then leveraged by ting , blue bond and Coon . They are doing such horrible things to me in NH now with h r t and all other aspects of medicine . It’s like they all have me pigeonholed .

Why am I rude ? Because they refuse to admit the well documented unanimous conclusions that any woman that has gone thru female genital mutilation is severely traumatized ? Or is it because they refuse to admit that this was obviously done intentionally ? Or is it because the wpath system is a group of doctors that are allowing other doctors to be a predatory system to boulstered endless advocacy funding ? At the end of the what if’s none of the systems have even cared that to this day Kathy Rumer is allowed to advertise that hair will NOT ( she says it in bold letters ) , grow back inside the vagina and I have a ton of it . So there is an obvious interest with micro and macro false advertising going on everywhere in this field and the surgeons that don’t know do now , so yeah there that . My children and wife do not deserve this right when I was in the middle of home renovations and now our house is in shambles because I am the restorer and now can barely get thru a day of no activity at all because of the pain that’s now traveling into my leg foot and abdomen . There is no compassion with any of them and they built an empires of lies .... that’s all I can ( justifiably ) think now but ..... never mind

But let’s not forget that I have the email from dr ting saying she did the exact same things to all of us ! Really ? You all judge the victims photos and tell me if that’s true now that I came to the party ! My kids hear me fighting all the time with government and medical ....... take a guess how much they trust America ! This is all so sick ! No American family should be being collapsed by the very doctors that pretend they just want me to have peace !

I am a hunter from PA which is another reason I wanted to go to mcginn I just never thought I would be hunting a group of wolves preying on people thru the Rumer conservative ploy to balance the huge disconnects of all transgender articles trying to say complications are rare ! Obviously we all are learning that is a lie . I am only asking them to end the megalomania and pick up the oaths they all swore ! And all victims of this should not be being used by the doctor that claims such a bleeding heart for female genital mutilation and yet buried my family in nothing but hell on earth ! I have had surgeries down there when I was very young because of things doctors still can not figure out about my genitals . Am I wrong for not trusting any of the transgender system after being absent when I need them most ? They refuse to bring in nerve specialist and because I am pointing that out have now added nerve specialist to the ( sub specialty list of North Carolina university hospital transgender doctor . The problem is I don’t need a sex change surgeon poising as a nerve specialist when only the very best nerve specialist can help correct the nerves that were already corrected when I was six to to mild genital ambiguity ! So you see they all know how bad Rumer screwed me up and then said they were ( bowers and ting ) going to be an excepted in a class action law suit  .... don’t believe ? I have the emails .... the ones where bowers said what was done to me is horrific and unacceptable . That the results speak for themselves ! She said dr ting agrees with her that bowers is an evil force and needs shut down . They connected me with the attorney Scott seskin and then I caught Scott dragging out statue of limitations !!! These are all verbatim quotes . When I asked ting if a urologist would be included and if he had any photographs of the Rumer patients he and bowers said they filled schedules with patients of Rumer , ting then refused to help me ! I could go on ..... I’m not looking for law suits Ian looking for honesty so I can be at peace with getting help and again go into surgery wondering if my kids will be okay if I die ! My kids are the best and i feel like these doctors are the only ones allowed to have kids and happy marriages and solid mental health !!! They are tearing us apart slowly and they all know it !

I can’t go to McGinn or blue bond ( Fox News) puppet #1 they tell me to go back to rumer , dr leis confirmed Rumer lied when she told me she couldn’t remove the penis base or I would go incontinent , McGin was my first choice but she would not allow my insurance to pay for me .Kathy Rumer owned the monopoly on that lie so the universities and the private could compete ( insurance ) this all goes back to me changing my middle name to hope because I believed in the navy and admired her love for life ! There is nothing to admire about any of these surgeons as they chew away my life deliberately ! Hope you all find peace with things that they claim to be in operations for but they have done nothing but ensure I can never get help and then flaunt the antagonist linguistics and flagrant entertainment of my obvious suffering while expecting me to reply nicely , submissively and in trauma ! And all of America medicine supports it on both sides of the isle because at the end of all the pious grandstanding we all will still need medicine ! Sick shit ! My local doctors refuse to even let me be in the practice anymore .

And by the way they are still going to Rumer because as dr bowers told me in an email she hires a company to whitewash negative reviews ! And for your information everything we say here is being seen by all the new electronic patient gathering systems : example  : health grades , my chart , epic systems and all others

Because until the victims form an alliance of what is really going on she ( and all surgeons ) in this field , are engaged in consumer rights violations , human rights violation , medical rights violations , and using the civil rights clauses of the US doj to mysteriously ensure doctors ( in this field ) , from accountability and keep the flow of my Sinai’s illegal organ transplantation into soldiers of Iraq where the primary injury is groin and genital trauma ..... and low and behold the need for Marci bowers and Christine mcginn , Rachael Lavigne and others ! Now if you want my extracurricular studies that is a conversation for another day . Being a think tank expert on the transgender takeover of American medicine , you only have to ask why are the surgeons who are advocating for and endless chain of victims and underserved minority ( primarily the surgeons ) then ignoring clear victimns of the biggest minority ( those who actually have sex change ) you all need to wake up ! Obviously I want help to get corrected but until the scan of surgeons in this feild prohibiting specialists ( that are obviously needed )from entering into the multidisciplinary surgical setting , morbid outcomes will never get corrected ! Of course there is the added benefit of ( somehow ) surgeons in this field deliberately ignoring those of us that are suffering actual medical trauma ( now) and refusing us to have university ( or otherwise )care and strictly prohibiting an actual interdisciplinary team from ever forming . Even the remote possibility of my bullet points being accurate , the truth is out there but never until the victmns say enough is enough , ironically I thought that’s what the whole transgender movement was in regards to ! Oh and when I say wake up , no I am not with any Q tard affiliations ! Lots of moving pieces so if you can’t juggle them atleast don’t scold or mock those of us who can and want it fixed for all of us ! This is a war people and we are not supposed to be the ones fighting it ! The surgeons in this field are !

By the way I am not saying you scolded or mocked , it’s just there seem to be transgender umbrella people that could care less about any of us who have been dealing with this since we were very young and now we are essentially prisoners of a political war ! The surgeons know it , I know it , and the last thing any of them wan’t is any of us exposing the evil underbelly of this transgender movement ...... it may be harsh but it is the truth in every regard and believe me when I tell you no one want’s solutions like victims of lifelong torture by the hands of those that say they want the same ( surgeons ) I don’t back down , I don’t retreat ! I hunt until everyone gets free from wolves in sheep’s clothing !

By the way university systems are now systematically demanding that I never seek ANY medical services from them ever again and I am strictly never to contact them again for any reason . My primary health care system has done the same and the obgyn doctor that told the truth about what was done to me got fired .... so you do the math

i am in the NYC area which seems to be where alot of the surgeons you are looking at are from. this is definitely botched but i know of a few other surgeons including one that does take all insurance. im FTM with an MTF girlfriend though and i have personal experience with one of the surgeons who i believe isnt within the same network! maybe you can go to him for another opinion? pms r open

Actually universities are now closing down services to me and Sherman leis can’t help do two of the surgeries needed nor bring in three of the specialties I need ! Please keep in mind I specifically need an iliolinguinal specialist and a peritoneum specialist ..... we all did and that is the dirty little secret of why the litchteinstein hernia institute dissolved and lifelong suffering began for hoards of mesh settlements and otherwise ! As necessity demands the general public will no longer be the victimn of this inhumane racket , and more nefarious groups of surgeons ( transgender ) will now target and contain victims of female genital mutilation ( sex change corrections ) into making us irate for enhances emotion , psychological and extended physical suffering ,as well as prolonging our family collapse ( inevitable ) , to achieve maximum patient duress . And all this because the professors world wide have concluded that absence they’re participation in a multidisciplinary format patient outcome is morbid ! The entire thing is a racket in that the medical world ( EVERYWHERE) has conclude the participation of this surgical specialty to ( obviously ) be included into surgical correction ) but the fake ass transgender rights gambit refuses to bring them in when they are needed most ! In fact hospitals everywhere are excluding this specialty and as such , aforementioned specialty is unable to be located anywhere !

I am well aware of what I should and should not do but in a situation like this only unconventional methods can get conventional systems to return to human rights . I don’t want to advertise my private parts either but I am being forced to by the very groups that pretend this is all about dignity and respect ! I don’t want any of this to be happening ! Thanks for your concern but I’m covered ..... obviously a heart full of fear does not help me get actual medical care and not some forced third party medical fraud that continues to remove large portions of my actual medical file and then instigate tensions and duress thru interactions of me doing my due diligence and asking for reassurances that the correct specialists will be involved ( something transgender should encourage ! ) , facts are stubborn things and I eat them for breakfast lunch and dinner ! I have children it just comes with the territory of responsible parenting !

My experience with surgeons and my interactions with all surgeons and the Orwellian games they play with me to instigate my ( transgenderphobic) rhetoric is spewed at the surgeons clearly ! I have my own children life and long term stability to focus on ! As for my views of transgender ( not a clinical term for SEX change by the way , has no interest in inserting everyone’s precious labels but only the accountability therein . I am well aware of the numbers that are against me and also aware that anyone turning a blind eye to such accountability towards adults now encouraging children is by no way acceptable nor safe for children to be subjected to ! So many have a problem with me staying the obvious above self interest but I thought accountability was the whole reason this stuff got the green light by the American medical system . I love all people , so long as they are honest and not willing to put self interest above community safety and health . Thank you for such nice words but please consider my interest is towards accountability for all not simply myself and all the many e mail interactions I have had over 6 years with all surgeons concludes this matter for any one that cares to actually act and not just talk .

I do agree that these people should be held accountable!! However supporting or hinting toward supporting laws that prevent people from getting the help they need seems very harmful such as the comment you made about a law in Japan.
</p>
<p>
Children do not get surgeries that are related to being transgender nor is anyone advocating for that so I’m unsure of what you’re referring to in that case.

The reason you’re having trouble posting is because you have negative karma. I have to approve all your comments manually and it sometimes takes a while.

I expect you are misunderstanding what she wrote, and possibly what I am saying.
</p>
<p>
The WPATH Standards of Care are guidelines covering trans care, but they do not explain precisly how surgery is to be performed. There&#39;s nowhere in them that would say your result is compliant with the standard or not.

This is the WPATH Standards of Care

If you have a WPATH document that says otherwise please post a link.

Perhaps I should post what she said since you seem to believe I am a single cell organism . All due respect , but you seem to be saying there are no current protections on paper . Maybe I misunderstood something ?

There’s some protections. I’m sure they accidentally killing you would be trouble. But as to the quality of the result protections are severly lacking. If it was a more common surgery that had been around for years, like an orchi, they may be some quality standards they could be held accountable to.

These e mails are a response under patient protections not the other way around and the dates speak for themselves as well as are not in any way grandfathered into any stipulations of new laws . I am well equipped to expose , d coni ate and destroy any attempts at using American citizens simple lab rats with no protections of bill of rights as well as human rights . But thanks for caring .

Take it up with all the surgeons that post expected outcomes . Not to be tormented by doctors is a standard of care in and of itself . In the end yes there are standards of care , but this really is an exercise in futility when they all refuse to be honest about the standards they are all violating with all the victims of this snarky little game and leaving us all with no options as to who can actually correct what others have done . Until we understand the obligations that are in place ( which they will not respect ) , then all else is useless . But at the end of it all what does any of it matter if they are using a system of lies to hide behind anyway ?

The risks are pretty low if you have a good surgeon. Be careful selecting your surgeon and you should have a good result.

Yeah that isn&#39;t true at all lol, &#34;lower&#34; sure but people who go to &#34;good&#34; surgeons suffer complications all the time.  The risk is still there, surgery obviously isn&#39;t perfect.

Uhm define &#34;simple&#34; complications, because many complications can also be debilitating longterm. If you&#39;re referring to the &#34;simple&#34; complications in this post, then you&#39;re sadly mistaken

No, the OP&#39;s condition is not the result of a simple complication.
</p>
<p>
Simple complications include hyper granulation, wound separation and other less common situations. They may prolong the healing, but typically don&#39;t leave any long term problems. Simple complications are the common ones. The major complications are far less common.
</p>
<p>
It is important to know that the severity and rate of complication varies based on the technique and skill of the surgeon. This is why it is so important to get as much information as you can about the surgeons you are considering and choose one you trust.
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of post op girls. Many of us had what I term as simple complications. Some had no complications. No one had major complications.

It&#39;s a dice roll no matter what because it&#39;s surgery. That is just ignorant to act like everything will be okay just because it&#39;s with a &#34;good&#34; surgeon, whatever that means.

Everything in life is risky. Cross the street to and you could get hit by a car go for a swimming ocean and you could be swept out to sea. The point is these are all low risks. That&#39;s the same as getting surgery from a reputable surgeon. Nothing is without risk. If it seems to risky, then obviously surgery is not for you, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that these procedures when performed by skilled surgeons are very low risk. Complications can arise, but when they do they are manageable and the outcomes are still outstanding.

I think you may be overlooking a few things in terms of complications. Yes they can be fixed in most case --eventually. It takes time, money and a lot of trauma to power through all of those revisions. It can  interrupt your life for years and destroy your self-confidence. It&#39;s not always just a wee little revision. It can be 2 or 4, maybe 6 additional surgeries with multiple surgeons to get back to an acceptable result. It takes over your life like nothing else. You don&#39;t get over it.
</p>
<p>
Of course the majority of outcomes are good. There&#39;s no question about that. But it&#39;s a mistake to believe that a few minor complications can&#39;t become a multi-year, life-altering, and debilitation experience. I&#39;ve lived this for the last 4 years because of an inexperienced surgeon. I&#39;ve paid a huge price for my poor choice in surgeons.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t change my feelings about the need for heath care and trans-related surgery, but it&#39;s made me an advocate of the 50 procedure rule when choosing a surgeon for anything.

The incidence of serious adverse events related to vaginoplasty surgery is low, whereas minor events are common. After a threshold of 50 vaginoplasty surgeries, these events were reduced, including the need for revision surgery.

I am so sorry to hear about your difficulties. I hope everything is good now.
</p>
<p>
I, in no way, mean to minimize the possibility of lasting issues, jus point out that the probability is low.  I agree about the surgeon&#39;s experience. As I commented above, the selection of the surgeon is critical. I would do further than a 50 procedure rule and suggest that the surgeon needs to be performing the procedure in volume. I also recommend anyone looking for a surgeon to ask about the prospective surgeon&#39;s complication rate and revision rate.

I&#39;m updating the latest results from Feb 05, 21 today. It&#39;s amazing how far it&#39;s come, but I&#39;m back for more surger this summer. She just wrecked my Vulgar. Then she tried to gaslight me by saying that what she does for all her girls. That was just a lie. I was one of her earliest patients. She&#39;s never posted any results on her page using that tack-down the flap approach. Then she had to butcher the top too. I guess book-end disaster is what she was going for.
</p>
<p>
By the way, the complications rates are listed in that study by Dr Ferrando.

Really ? Because last I checked the only one advertising amazing results uniformely is Thailand kamol institute and the only corrections of serious complications in America and final outcomes is never offered by teaching universities ... please tell me if I’m missing something ? Any surgeons in the us wether first or second surgery offer no compatible consistency as does kamol ! Please explain this since they are all involved in running the same wpath connections that require the surgeons to work very closely together and uniformly work towards the technique with the most efficacy

I&#39;m not sure what you point is  I can say every surgeon is different. Some have more skill than others. You need to choose the surgeon that you believe is the best for you. Ask them about the complications they see in their patients and then decide. If that is Kamol, then great, you&#39;ve decided.

Must be nice to live in a world where I can pretend it’s that easy ! Which is all the more condemning to these so called surgical advocates of change and patient protections . Every surgeon is deflective and most are backbiting about each other . When we are deliberately mutilated because we had no patient protections in the system that claims to have encompassed global empire based on patient protections yet we are expected to act like nothing is wrong except we are not happy with results even still to date . If not are willing to say what was done to me is wrong then how then ( please tell ) am I supposed to trust they know what right is ?

Bear in mind that&#39;s advertising, not patient reported.

Good point ! And by the way I am in touch with the patients of all doctors and just because they want to not have anything to do with forums such as these does not mean I am haphazardly making comments of photos alone . I am well aware of the system and it’s many hidden measures to obscure the wrongdoing thru the wpath network of no patient protections for the sake of experimentations ! And just for the record we are all supposed to be notified if this is occurring !

Exactly and no American doctor that has an obligation to protect us from predetary systems are all in the same wpath club ..... which by the way os the surgeons policing themselves with protections fro every university legal team ...... what you thought it was a coincidence that Kathy went to university ting went newest surgery and now others are following suit ? I was in direct contact with Rachael Lavigne who covered it all up ! Any coincidence that Biden picked her ? This game needs to end and it needs treated like anything else female ! We should all be given gynecology as the door into a woman’s world and not subjected to the arbitrary transgender label which majoritarian never access our specific and distinct needs ! Men’s health is for men and women’s health is for women ..... period ! The reality becomes very blurred indeed when there are not distinct women’s health in charge of body parts that explicitly are only found on women .... this has all become a hunting ground for bad surgeons and the good ones protecting them while actually required to point them out as the oath all sides agreed to was do more good than harm !

And so is literally everything? Every time you leave the house you&#39;re accepting a risk of getting ran over or something. We get that you&#39;re bitter about your surgical results, and I&#39;m sorry your results weren&#39;t good. However, you&#39;re saying things that are false, and your arguments are just dumb. You can read
<a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.juro.2017.10.013" rel="nofollow">literally any study
</a>
about this topic and you&#39;ll find that most people didn&#39;t have complications and most of the complications that did occur were fixable with later treatments.

No, you all just circlejerk each other to feel better and ignore the objective realities and downsides of surgery in the pursuit of validation. It&#39;s ridiculous how passively people talk about the risks and realities/very real limitations of the surgery and act like every aspect miniscule and fixable. As many biased &#34;studies&#34; as there is, there&#39;s a whole lot of anecdotal experiences even from trans people how life ruining this surgery can be.
</p>
<p>
I think its dumb to argue that a potential life ruining surgery holds the same merit of risk as the rare instance of getting hit by car. What I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t false, it&#39;s the experience myself and many other have. Sorry the ugly side of surgery and people who don&#39;t personally recommend it and will speak objectively about the risks makes you uncomfortable. Not every experience is yours, so stop acting like by us speaking out about ours is somehow spreading &#39;misinformation&#39; because you don&#39;t view it that way. Oh well. Experiences vary, that&#39;s life. Not everyone is going to agree with this path.

Perhaps I don’t understand you , sorry , personally I would only use this smart phone stuff for a target at 500 yrds ! None of this technology of my cart or anything medical has even an ounce of it’s intended purpose . None of these surgeons are willing to give any of Kathy Rumer s victims an actual multidisciplinary surgical team with the best in the business and thereby at least give us a fighting chance at having a quality of life . I’m so sad for America and what’s comming !if a minority medical system of less than one percent can’t be accountable ( especially when accountability was the guise they all changed all off American health care for ) , then wtf is really going on ? Does no body get it yet . Research Mt Sinai and the merger of the defense department and funding from the defense department towards transgender surgery at my Sinai ! The same is happening at Langone and John Hopkins thru more clandestine means if they did not want truth then they should never have played with this PA hunter .... any one that can help can e mail me at Ocean_hunter@live .com ...... everyone better wake up ..... this stuff is evil and none are more demonstrable than surgeons ignoring the hypocritical oath , patient bill of rights , human rights and others ..... I know because I want help not more lies ! I don’t need grooming lies , I need medical access to my patient bill of rights ! All universities are doing the same thing and if any one on here has a problem with me wanting honesty then please just don’t !🌸

Some of this sounds very &#34;conspiracy theory&#34; to me.  What&#39;s all this about the DOD funding transgender surgeries?   I am not trying to provoke you here or anything but whatever you found on this is what you should be posting here... not telling us to research it - because I for one, found nothing on the subject as you worded it.

Okay I just looked for it all and it’s nowhere to be found ! This is so crazy ! I absolutely hate this whole system .... as dr Marci bowers said in her e mail to me ( Kathy Rumer hires a company to whitewash negative reviews off the internet ..... that can never disappear and it is verbatim . So let me get this straight .... drs can do it but the dod can’t ?

I hate to give bad advice, but I would would lie and say I was trans if that could help you get the revision with Bluebond, or even Dr Jun. They need to hear that for insurance purposes and because of the letter requirements, so maybe if you just lie a little bit for the long term benefits then that could help, and I’m so sorry you have had such a tough time. You are a warrior, you are strong and you will come through this stronger than ever, keep your head up, and also boric acid can help get rid of hair in the canal from what I heard. Just keep adding the capsules inside the vagina and keep it warm and wet and hair will die off.
