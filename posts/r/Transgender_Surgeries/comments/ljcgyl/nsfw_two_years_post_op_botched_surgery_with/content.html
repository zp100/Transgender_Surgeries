Really doubtful that any surgeon out there will be able to fix what she&#39;s done to me. I tried to write a review on Google that was 100% honest but it doesn&#39;t show up. I later received and email from her saying she was severing the patient provider relationship bc I lied. Nothing in my review was dishonest. She lied to me about her experience and has lied to others, claimed she was trained under Bowers but Bowers own staff have never heard of her. She also updated her gallery on her website and it&#39;s by far some of the worst work I&#39;ve ever seen, even worse than Rumers&#39; work. I also have a ton of hair inside the vagina that she said she would remove during surgery but didn&#39;t. I cannot orgasm via clitoral stimulation and I still experience terrible stabbing pain in the clit and nerve bundle. The scars ache from time to time and when I press it feels like the bone is directly underneath, no fat. The clitoris&#39; position is extremely too high to look normal and because of the position it constantly rubs against clothing and feels so goddamn uncomfortable, like when I had a penis and it was restricted or compressed into my body by clothing but I can&#39;t rearrange it. It drives me insane.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve lost all hope of every dating again and this has killed my sex life. It&#39;s bringing me close to the point of suicidal ideation. I have constant panic attacks and every day I wake up into a nightmare. Unimaginable that this is my reality. I don&#39;t want pity, just to caution anyone out there who is thinking about going to this person, she ruined my life.

I am so sorry to hear this. It&#39;s a shame the dark side of human nature is present to this extent in such important aspects of medical care. I sincerely hope you can overcome this with the right help and craft a fulfilling life around your circumstance.

I&#39;m so sorry. That his just blatant incompetence or pure sadism. Take care of yourself, and hopefully you can get back to meeting new people. As a partial nullo, I can say that genitals aren&#39;t everything in dating/sex. But I couldn&#39;t imagine going through are and having this result. It was cruelty on the doctors part.

I already have a consultation but it&#39;s not until May 2022. I&#39;ve heard from others that she&#39;s great with first surgery but hesitant and reluctant with doing revisions for other people&#39;s patients. I also read she doesn&#39;t take out of state PPO insurance which is what I have.

I had SRS with Bluebond using an out of state PPO plan.  And she’s actually pretty well known for doing revisions.  Keep your appointment with her, you’ll be in excellent hands.  I’m sorry you’re going through this 😢

I would contact multiple doctor&#39;s for consults. And (this is just me) but if you&#39;re so distraught it&#39;s ruining your life my answer would be to do anything to resolve it. Quit your job and move to the state the surgeon is in and work a crappy job to get on insurance they&#39;ll take. Or take out a ton of loans with the intention of filing bankruptcy. It&#39;s only money. And nothing is worth you being so uncomfortable in your own skin.

So far I have Satterwhite, Bowers, Bluebond and Stiller.

I don&#39;t think financial ruin is really the option for fixing this. Ruining my credit would only bring further argument to kill myself later on.

It sucks you&#39;ve having to go through all this pain.  Adding onto SelenityMoon&#39;s response, most hits to your credit score only last 7-10 years. Yeah bankruptcy sucks, but you can rebuild your credit fairly quickly after that period and it&#39;s not like they can repo your vag 2.0. I&#39;d like to emphasize finances are nothing to be ashamed of, the system is designed to exploit people like us for everything we&#39;re worth. So take what you can, give nothing back and lean on your comrades for support!

Well that is definitely another layer of fucked isn&#39;t it.... It sucks that you trusted someone and they did you so dirty, especially when they are suppose to do no harm. At the  bare minimum I&#39;d consider filing a complaint with the medical licensing board in your area for lack of professional competence [1].
</p>
<p>
Not a lawyer either, but allegedly that&#39;s against the in the US [2]. But we both know that the law doesn&#39;t apply to rich folks or companies here. Might be worth it to consult with a lawyer to see what you can do to protect yourself (like saving good job reviews).
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just a rube but am willing to help you research your options if that would be helpful. I&#39;m sorry things seem so bleak atm :-(

Yeah, I am still dependent on Macphee&#39;s office to send my medical records to consulting physician&#39;s. Once I get a far a long enough I&#39;ll probably file a complaint. I know they have a legal obligation to provide it anyways but I feel I need to be diplomatic still.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also worth mentioning that by filing for bankruptcy I would be causing a loss for my employer so I think in this scenario they might actually be capable of termination, not to mention I work in a right to work state. I do eventually want to get out of NC but it&#39;s probably going to be after covid ends and another reason I&#39;m being onto my job is because of my insurance, which I&#39;m really hoping they will cover revision.
</p>
<p>
If they don&#39;t I don&#39;t know honestly if I can get enough credit to even cover revision. I know Bluebond for example can cost up to over $100k without insurance and I don&#39;t have that much even in credit

There&#39;s always additionally a lawyer to sue your original surgeon which is absolutely something I&#39;d consider but you may be wrapped up in legal battles for years.
</p>
<p>
Find a surgeon that will take your case and start finding jobs in that state. Money means nothing. Geographical location not that big of a deal. If you can find someone who can help to make you feel whole do anything and everything to make it so. It sucks you&#39;re going through this and I know it probably sounds like I&#39;m saying &#39;just pick up and move no big deal&#39; but I recognize this is going to be HARD. Every consult you go through, every fight with insurance and money and relocating and it&#39;s all hard. But you only get one chance to live on this planet. We&#39;re afforded very few sunrises in the grand scheme of things so find something you look forward to, a reason to hang in there and fight for what you need.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there are partners that won&#39;t be concerned with your genitals. But it sounds like for now you should focus on you.

I know people who have gone to her for revisions and she&#39;s done amazing work. She&#39;s fixed a lot of bad work from others, she knows what she&#39;s doing.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure what you&#39;re doing through right now feels horrible. We get shit on all the fucking time and so few people care. But you know what? We&#39;re tough motherfuckers too. You can do hard things. You already have and yes you need to do some more but you can.
</p>
<p>
We&#39;re all turning a corner and your life will too, I&#39;m sure of it.

I&#39;m just too tired. Too much trauma, too much picking up the pieces and moving forward only for another sucker punch, another blindsiding. What&#39;s even the goal anymore, the reward, where is this going. I can&#39;t have children now, I severely tarnished any chances for finding a romantic partner who will truly care. I&#39;m all I have in this world and the whole world still hates us. Most trans people even hate other trans folk. Everyone can crack and I feel I&#39;m reaching that point. This isn&#39;t a corner I&#39;m turned either, this is an irreparable mutilation.

I feel this within the depths of my soul as someone who was botched as well. The amount of regret I feel each and every day physically hurts, I&#39;ve lost so much in &#34;hopes&#34; for this surgery.  I don&#39;t feel like people understand how tiring it is to live this kind of nightmare, to keep pushing forward to seek help in a body you&#39;re now backseat to, and the substantial lack of resources and help one can find once you&#39;re in this position. Surgeons in this field of medicine all but wash their hands of you once it isn&#39;t peaches and roses. My heart goes out to you, from one person in this position to another. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;ll get better, but time will pass and it&#39;ll hopefully become more manageable. I hope you find a surgeon to agree to a revision in due time.

Sorry to hear that. I actually had a consultation with Ting last month but saw your posts and decided not to go. Not to mention their office staff is awful and it&#39;s hard as hell to get through. I wish you good luck with your revision. I think from what I&#39;ve seen that your results will be salvageable, I feel like I&#39;m fucked beyond repair.

May be worth talking to Dr Wittenberg and Dr Satterwhite in San Francisco. Your vulva is somewhat reminiscent of mine in the distance between interoitus and urethra though even more pronounced.

Does it feel like that tissue swells up when you get aroused?

Wittenberg is a no, she wanted me to get new recommendation letter and a third on top. Which makes no sense considering I already had the procedure. They also really came off suspicious by making such a fuss about arbitration agreement. They ended up mailing it to me because the faxed copy I sent over wasn&#39;t or the scanned copy didn&#39;t look good enough for some reason. She&#39;s also pretty new.
</p>
<p>
I also need the clitoris and nerve bundle lowered or completely removed on top of a fat transfer and Wittenberg doesn&#39;t do either of those. I sent a consultation to satterwhite but haven&#39;t heard back.
</p>
<p>
Yeah I have a ton of erectile tissue. My penis used to be a grower, flaccid it would look almost small but it would grow to 7 inches. So when I get aroused I&#39;m very embarrassed and repulsed. It looks like a stoma.  It feels weird too.
</p>
<p>
I also have a consultation with Bowers in July but it&#39;s going to be $360 just to have a consultation....

That&#39;s a valid point. I probably will cancel tbh just bc $360 for a consultation is insane.

Fuck no. It’s hard to speak to technique because I get she was 2nd cook in the kitchen with me, but from the moment things went south, she—like Rumer—began what has since turned into literal years of ignoring me, gaslighting me, and probably using her clout to make it impossible for other surgeons to work on me rather than coaxing them to go above and beyond.
</p>
<p>
I rejected her outright offer to make me a “cosmetic clitoris” rather than make any effort to harvest the remaining penile nerves to try and restore proper sensation, and since then she has literally called me “Don Quixote,” and reminded me how in the days of Drs. Schrang and Biber, I’d have been considered a great result.
</p>
<p>
So in short she tried to sell me on “well you were botched in 2014 and I sealed the deal on ruining your life in 2017 but now you’ve got a decent 1970’s trans vagina.” Never mind that I can’t be penetrated, am missing a clitoris, and have a 1” flap of tissue sticking out with a hole in it I can stick a cotton swab through.
</p>
<p>
The pictures speak for themselves at hannahsimpson.com/surgery.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Bowers maybe is a longtime experienced and passable first time surgeon, but if things don’t go perfectly she ghosts you and moves onto the next patient because you are disposable. Then when you complain she refers you to seek mental health treatment. You and your fucked up vagina their luggage to unpack now.
</p>
<p>
I have seen over 40 doctors in 10 countries since Dr. Bowers botched me. She facilitated and collaborated with me on precisely ZERO of those appointments. Technically she referred me to one, but only after three years of prodding and over a year since the doctor never even wrote me a written summary of his findings. He pulled a Marci Bowers and ghosted me too.
</p>
<p>
In short, no I cannot recommend her to anyone I care about.

I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;ve been through this. Thank you for your honest and painful commentary.
</p>
<p>
So it&#39;s been six years since your last revision?  What are your thoughts on Bluebond? I see her name floated constantly.
</p>
<p>
If I may ask, how have you dealt with this? How are you doing?

They asked me for letters too in the standard upfront request. I politely replied that I was enquiring about a revision, that my original psych letters were dated for my original surgery, and were new letters actually required for a revision?  Turns out the answer was no, though they would appreciate a copy of my original letter, which I happily forwarded to them.
</p>
<p>
Fair point re: the arbitration agreement. I felt comfortable signing it in advance of a consult anyways. I can absolutely understand needing to have a legible copy of the signed agreement on their end. I don&#39;t know what your respective setups are like but I&#39;ve some seen hilarious things come out of fax quality.
</p>
<p>
Newer as a bottom surgeon, yes. New to surgery in general? Not quite so much (her gynecology experience goes back a few years too...)
</p>
<p>
I totally understand feelings about desired levels of experience, it&#39;s part of how I ended up looking at a revision. Other parts included bad luck and ??? (The op notes from my original surgery don&#39;t have details about a few deviations from the expected procedure.)
</p>
<p>
Removing much of that erectile tissue will help move things more anterior, get rid of the bulge, and make penetration easier..
</p>
<p>
From your photos, it looks like you&#39;ve got all the right bits and structures, you just have too much in some parts and other parts could do with some rearranging. I may be able to point you towards a paper on labiaplasty revisions that you might find interesting.
</p>
<p>
If you are comfortable waiting until 2022 for Bluebond-Langner, I&#39;d very much listen to what she has to say.

Can you explain what exactly Wittenberg said about the arbitration agreement? It’s not the first time people mention here her being weird about contracts.

Well, I never spoke to Wittenberg but the secretary was very neurotic about the agreement. They sent me a packack of paperwork to file out and the agreement is included in it. The agreement they send has an almost faded red border at the top, looks almost pink but again, this is their document they send. I printed it at work and scanned it and it looked exactly the same but they said it didn&#39;t look good enough. I also faxed it and had the same response. They sent me one via snail mail. The first one never came so two weeks later they sent me another after I had to request it. When it came, it looked exactly the same, faded red/pink. I sent it back and they accepted it. The whole thing felt very shady. I also wanted to make 100% sure that I wouldn&#39;t have to get brand new letters for a revision and they couldn&#39;t give me a straight answer but we&#39;re pushy about scheduling me for a consultation and getting my $60 fee. I decided to not even bother at this point because I want going to go with them if they required brand new letters and they couldn&#39;t even give me an answer beforehand.

Im actualy pissed how this doctor tries to gaslight and then cancel you.. Rather than admit she can&#39;t fix it and that you need to seek revision to another specialist.
</p>
<p>
Have you considered getting your canal redone with PPV or Colon?  No matter what you do its gonna be a big revision..

I have. I&#39;m going to see if I can get ppv.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s been gaslighting me from the beginning. It started after I brought the hairs up, she said it would go away in time but it didn&#39;t. I also said I was unhappy with the appearance and the erectile tissue but she said she couldn&#39;t do anything more to help me and played dumb, said I was the best result she&#39;s had. Then accused my lack of satisfaction with the results on being depressed.

I feel every ounce of what you&#39;re going through. I&#39;ve lived it for the last 4 years. Even the dismissal part. I&#39;m sorry anyone has to go through this garbage. She knows damn well what she&#39;s done to you is unacceptable. The first course of action is dismissal for some bogus reason and then you&#39;re ghosted.  The good news it that there is probably surgeon who can and will repair the damage. You just have to find them. I actually found help through my Nurse Case manager at Anthem. You&#39;re insurance company may have something similar. She was my rock and helped me find the right care within my insurance network. I ended up getting care in another state but remained in-network. Anthem BCBS really stepped in at the right time and did what my local healthcare providers wouldn&#39;t do.
</p>
<p>
See if your insurance company has a case manager program, to help you manage all of this.

I&#39;m really cautious about reaching out. My insurance company isn&#39;t the greatest and I&#39;m based in NC. Nobody really has much experience with this and in general are uncomfortable. I was getting misgendered and ignored by the nurses at the hospital where I had bottom surgery.

I don’t think you’re a moron, but I understand feeling that way. I hope you can get the answers and help that you need to deal with this 💕

I’m sorry that she did this to you.  Hopefully, a revision can get you in the range of normal.❤️

Have you thought of using a Thai doctor?   You might try PAI and ask Dr. Preecha for a consultation.   He did a lot of SRS in his day and he may be able to devise a game plan for some of his younger surgeons.  I know insurance is important from what you have written, but it might be a better strategy to save  money for a Thai doc.

Maybe ask a lawyer to see if you have a case as the work she did on you can&#39;t be good for your mental health.

Getting a reconstructive urologist for a consult would be my next step had I landed here where you are. It really upsets me that plastic surgeons are doing a surgery that SHOULD be reserved to be done exclusively by a reconstructive urologist who&#39;s entire practice is centered around that one specific part of the body.

I was considering going to Macphee because she&#39;s closest to where I live, but after seeing this as well as some other sub par results on her own website, I will go elsewhere.

Maybe you could talk to Dr. Salam Al Kassis at Vanderbilt Plastic Surgery Clinic in Nashville, TN. He accepts Blue Cross Blue Shield and other insurances. He’s really great at what he does and would probably have no issue with revision! Refer to my profile for results :,)

How was what I said disrespectful? It&#39;s called common sense. Also, honesty needs to be heard so this doesn&#39;t happen to someone else. Get a grip.

I don&#39;t typically engage negative comments or users like you because frankly I can&#39;t tell if you are a troll or sincere. I would like to say however that this isn&#39;t a back alley surgeon. This is someone who gets referrals from Duke medical transgender clinic in Durham NC. This is someone who my own therapist persuaded me to see when I had concerns. This is a surgeon who several other users on this very subreddit have praised. This surgeon when you Google her name has a five star review. I am a methodical person, I did my research. I made this thread not so someone like you could traipse on in and said, &#34;told ya so&#34; as I&#39;m well aware that I shouldn&#39;t have taken someone on word alone. However, this argument about the real world is ridiculous victim blaming that takes the side of a predatory practice. I anticipated someone with this reputation, business and not to mention their license to uphold would have been honest and that the fact that they are a compulsive liar is not excusable. No, I made this thread to warn others out there. So you can kindly stop arguing with the mod.  Thank you.

I would try dr Littleton in Brazil, the doc that I intend to have my surgery with. He&#39;s had many botched cases and you getting surgery somewhere the currency is extremely devalued might be a good option.

He seems to place the clit too high up.

I also have reservations in regards to traveling to Brazil while Bolsonairo is in charge.

That&#39;s not him, this paper was written by another doctor, one that at some point I even considered. This doctor does penile inversion, which is not what  dr Littleton does. About Bolsonaro, girl, we had the same reservations. Just like when the USA elected Donald Trump, life went on. At the end of the day, the poor ones suffered with the increased violence agains trans folk. As unfair as it is, you as a foreigner would be at a good hospital and then probably at a nice apt recovering. I don&#39;t think you&#39;d be in danger here besides Covid.
