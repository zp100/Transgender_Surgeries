If this comes off as rude, I&#39;m extremely sorry. It&#39;s not my intention, but as I&#39;m researching surgeons right now, the first thing I look at is their complication rates and patient reviews. I wouldn&#39;t go near James Bell Bellringer if he offered me it for free. What kind of research did you do pre op into him? Cause from a lot of other unfortunate souls I see similar stories. His results never tend to soar beyond fine for most people. If its any conciliation there are surgeons who will revise it if you&#39;re having issues but 3 months is early days still so you might be left waiting. hopefully I&#39;m the meantime your pain at least goes down and the dilation process becomes more bearable. Nobody should have to endure bad results from a surgeon they put their trust in, I&#39;m so sorry.

I can&#39;t speak for Aporia but Bellringer was in the running for my operation because of word of mouth.
</p>
<p>
His negative reviews seem to be mostly on Reddit. Unfortunately a lot of patients that don&#39;t check social media never acknowledge that their experiences may not align with what&#39;s possible elsewhere.

I understand, word of mouth is how I selected my ffs surgeon... initially. After that I did buckets of research into him to make sure he was right for me before I even booked a consultation. It seems strange to select a surgeon for such an important procedure on word of mouth alone. I find it odd any time I see a new post about negative experiences from patients of bellringer, or rumer, or kamol... they have my deepest sympathies but also I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a single positive review for any of them. It confuses me every time I see it. I dont know if that&#39;s a shitty take though, so sorry if it seems ignorant.

If you&#39;re getting surgery on the NHS you&#39;d expect the recommended surgeons to be at least average in terms of expected outcomes.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s only when doing research into it myself that I found that isn&#39;t the case... Even then I was willing to risk it before I was told by a friend that McGinn was viable for me in terms of costs.
</p>
<p>
The GIC gives you extremely limited information, as do the surgeons themselves. Information is hard to find outside of Reddit too.

Unfortunately it&#39;s not something it&#39;s easy to get info on, sure. The NHS isn&#39;t exactly the best in terms of quality health care, it can&#39;t even give its staff free parking, it&#39;s in need of serious reform, not just for trans people but for everyone. I&#39;m still waiting to hear back from my GIC so I decided to just transition privately, good thing too cause its been 2 years since I self refered and it&#39;s been radio silence.

I googled to try to find opinions but everything I found was just complaints about his attitude. Not his work. I spoke to a few women in person who had dealt with him but they liked the results (I have no idea why now I&#39;ve seen what his average result looks like close up).
</p>
<p>
And yeah. I&#39;m going to pay to get this mess fixed next year. At least from an external aesthetic perspective. I&#39;m probably screwed on depth, which despite what one user claims isn&#39;t due to me not trying hard enough nor due to using a pre dilator (the gender nurse said it was ok to use thinner dilators so long as I was back to using the ones they provided before my checkup). The only thing that makes me feel even semi okay is I can probably still go up another dilator size or two - and I know some shorter afabs who only have 3-4 inches of depth themselves.

Not necessarily, you could have a scan done to see what&#39;s causing the issue with your depth or you could have a different surgeon perform ppt or something on you to fix the depth I&#39;m sure. Don&#39;t give up hope just yet, it&#39;s not over til it&#39;s over ✌️

Didn&#39;t know a scan was an option. I&#39;ll look into it. Ain&#39;t looking forward to these extra unexpected costs (I was hoping to start saving for some minimal FFS).

I&#39;m sure I saw a post of someone on here last week who had posted a CT of their canal, I cant remember what purpose for, but I&#39;m sure it could help reveal any potential obstruction or highlight why it&#39;s been so painful for you.

Good luck with it all.

She was having tightness issues and wanted to know what was going on. The doctor couldn&#39;t see back there with usual methods, so they wanted her to get an MRI scan.

I&#39;ll never stop saying the NHS is in desperate need of reform. However I will say in that instance you do maintain the choice to postpone until your pre agreed on surgeon is available. It is still shitty being put on the spot like that though and having your surgery effectively canceled last second.

That was poor phrasing on my part. I look at the number of posts about them and the number of posts complaining of specific or broad complications to determine which ones are most common for them compared to others and the severity of them.

This is what scares me about going to someone in the UK…NHS or private. The lack of care, and quality of surgeon and technique for this kind of operation is shocking… Stay in hospital for 5/7 days and then send you on your way home hoping everything is okay and if you run into any problems… you’ll really struggle to be seen by anyone local let alone by the place you got the surgery! It’s awful for people who cannot afford it or cannot travel abroad. I’m really sorry you’ve gone through this, and I know a lot of us are desperate for surgeries but sometimes the outcome is not worth it :(

I&#39;ve never had a good experience in a hospital in his country, NHS or private. Example: a private care nurse managed to fail to get into my vein 5 times before attempting to go through the hand, only to then fail to release the tourniquet when removing the needle, resulting in blood squirting everywhere. I&#39;ve done it myself since and managed to do a better job..
</p>
<p>
I honestly don&#39;t trust our healthcare professionals or surgeons at this stage. I&#39;m probably going abroad for any future treatments. My new girlfriend had hers done by McGinn only a month prior to me and her results are so much better.

Damn, sorry you have experienced this. Sounds very similar to my experience with Hart in Australia. Two years post op, 5cm of PI depth after a failed hybrid PPV, big puffy lumpy labia majora, no clitoral hood or labia minora, little to no clitoral sensation, haven’t really been able to properly orgasm, penetrative sex is unlikely unless someone is packing an ultra-micro penis, hospital experience difficult, shit vegan food options and had to order ubereats, cavalier attitude by surgeon, minimal dilation instructions, incorrect post surgery care instructions given, incorrect pre-surgery instructions given, inadequate follow and surgeon not taking concerns seriously, delays in responses to rectify problems etc etc etc Whilst I appreciate my penis is gone, in hindsight I wish I had waited until after covid restrictions had passed so I could have travelled internationally for surgery.

I’m serious when I say I will never want to get a vaginoplasty because of stories like these. I don’t really have much dysphoria with my genitals, though I seriously feel for you, OP. Just reading this made me sick to my stomach, because as doctors we’re told first thing to do no harm, and here harm was definitely done physically and psychologically.

Not all surgeons are like that, you need to choose very carefully. eg

Honestly, same. I have little to no interest in sex, so I’ve never felt like I absolutely

to have a vagina.

My dating prospects as a trans woman are shitty anyway. It’s just not worth it.

I found my dating life got easier after coming out and getting more involved with my local queer scene tbh. There&#39;s always trans women or trans men to date out there (whatever you&#39;re into). I wouldn&#39;t personally ever attempt to date a straight person but there&#39;s lots of bisexuals out there. And hell I&#39;ve had a cis lesbian into me once (idk how I&#39;m not exactly good looking).

This is what a person deals with in the UK or Canada , we’re the same in Canada with the free British Commonwealth medical system offering SRS and it seems we’re totally out dated in reality with techniques regards to the rest of the world , Vancouver Canada is a joke , Montreal you’ll end up with a vulva that looks like two Hamburger buns for fk ! Sake , there’s no need of having a vulva that looks like a Christmas Ham sliced up and not functional !
</p>
<p>
I mean if you were a CIS born XX and had a cancer they’ll go out of there way to make your sexually functional vaginal wise - it’s so simple the Penis goes inside the vagina and should work from the git go SRS if you know what your doing as a surgeon - Penile Inversion should be abolished in my books , it’s a useless attempt to make a vaginal canal with skin not designed to be a vaginal canal and yet if born CIS XX they’ll take a segment of Jejunum early 70’s or Sigmoid mid 60’s and including PPT around mid 60’s and make that gal truly functional as long as your CIS born and do the more extensive surgery but it’s the Free system and this system that wants the cheapest quickest OR time to save buck with Government taxes that pay  for all these crappy SRS surgeries done cheaply doing PI  , not quality !
</p>
<p>
The NHS like in Canada is soooo ! Far behind and it all boils down to the cost of OR time doing the good proper functional techniques so a person can get on with their lives and be  sexually functional and normal looking once a serious surgery is done like SRS - I had Scrotal PI with Kamol 2019 but it was never truly functional so I went to Theerapong 2022 last fall  at my expense and re-did the canal with Colon ( 11 hour surgery time to fix a mess ) and it works great now - Orange Soul Source largest dilator 7 plus inches goes in after 4 years of fk’ing around with Canadian idiot surgeon’s who aren’t trained for squat in SRS surgery , such a disservice to a human being ? PI is only done because it’s the simplest SRS to learn for a surgeon but it’s the poorest technique post op for being functional and the aesthetics suck with limited labia minora
</p>
<p>
I’ve never seen a Transwoman that doesn’t want the basics aesthetically looking legit and proper and the patient rarely ever gets it what could be done post op , usually a two bit mess and years of revisions later ! - there’s NO excuse from these surgeons doing it for a person unless it works and looks good - try and get out of Country SRS from NHS or Canada like going to the best in the US like Min Jun/Bluebond and others - they don’t want  to pay for it at 150k - 200k US cost so they appease in Canada like we’re children “ You got your SRS “ stop bitching ! - Well for fk’s sake then do the job better than saving a buck to appease the tax payers that are against Transgender people bottom line !

To make it worse though he also does plenty of private work. I saw one woman complaining here after paying him over £22,000. There are American surgeons that charge less than that! The only issue is then you have to pay for flights each time you need a revision or checkup.
</p>
<p>
Bellringer is such an asshole. He even lies about how long surgery takes. He told one woman it took 2 hours but it was actually more like 75 minutes (she got a copy of her hospital records to confirm).

A few points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
very bad pain when first dilating is normal. You literally have to push through it. If I had stopped when it hurt I’d have only half the depth I have now. The nurses are insistent with you because if you don’t dilate to full depth you will lose it, which is what might have happened in your case. You really shouldn’t go down to smaller dilators, and if it’s tight and hurts you need to dilate twice as much really.
</li>
<li>
you are only 3 months out, it’s still early days. Sensation and aesthetic will improve a lot!
</li>
<li>
developing a UTI is a normal complication.
</li>
<li>
opiates aren’t really recommended after this type of surgery because of the risk of constipation and the complications thereof. Paracetamol and ibuprofen is normal.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I had my surgery at Parkside in Springtime but I can imagine it being super hot in the summer.
</p>
<p>
Try and stay positive though, a lot of what you’ve described is fairly normal (if at the more painful end of the scale) and your result will improve.

like I am literally telling you it would not go in even when they were pushing it for me. and I am telling you flat out it hurt more than when I&#39;ve fractured bones. it hurt more than when someone headbutted me and busted my nose open. that isn&#39;t in any way am acceptable amount of pain and I do not for one moment believe you if you say that&#39;s normal.

I’m sorry that you didn’t expect it to hurt a lot, but you are literally shoving a solid, slightly pointy object into a hole which has been artificially created, and is still an open wound at that time.

Pain is expected for sure, but nowhere near to that extreme.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon or her assistant (who is present at most checkups and through the surgeries themselves) are present to help with the initial dilation and in cases of extreme difficulty and/or pain they&#39;ll provide a smaller dilator to ease into purple.
</p>
<p>
The vibe I get from Bellringer patients is that he expects everyone to react in the same way to surgery, and any deviation from what he considers the norm is the fault of the patient.

I never had any pain dilating. If you are experiencing that much pain, for you as well as OP, they should provide adequate drugs to deal with it.

You are being incredibly dismissive of someone&#39;s discomfort and experience for the sake of being &#34;right&#34;.  I encourage you to read the rest of the post over, and exercise compassion in responding, because this as they say, ain&#39;t it.

I have a very hard time believing that it is commonplace to not prescribe opiates for pain after such a major surgery.
</p>
<p>
My wife literally got two 1-inch incisions on her belly and was still sent home with a prescription for oxycodone and stool softeners.

<p>
For an abdominal surgery? Or were the incisions only skin-deep? If it was an abdominal laparoscopic surgery (which seems likely given the prescription of oxycodone and stool softeners), that&#39;s not mild at all and can be extremely painful, speaking from experience.
</p>
<p>
But I agree, I struggle to believe that painkillers are not a standard bottom surgery prescription. I&#39;ve been prescribed opiates after every single surgery I&#39;ve had, even for ones where honestly I felt no pain at all.

A laparoscopy definitely warrants opiates. That&#39;s pretty invasive. Obviously on the outside it looks like 2 small cuts but most of the damage is internal, and it will cut through the abdominal muscle too. Obviously not as much as eg a C-section or open abdominal surgery, but it still has to go through the layer of muscle which will really hurt.

My surgeon was Dr McGinn in the US, and I had access to morphine from Tuesday (day of the op) through to the Friday. I was given a prescription for mild opiates after that too (a generic version of vicodin) to take as needed in the weeks post op.

As a comment on the pain relief provided, there are ways to mitigate those side effects that also provide benefits during the surgery too.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon makes patients go through a bowel cleanse prior to the op, along with a slow reintroduction to solid foods a few days post. This means constipation is lessened (and will only realistically present a week post op), while having an added benefit of reducing the chances of bad complications around the rectum during the operation itself.
</p>
<p>
The fact this doesn&#39;t happen feels like a knock on from the fact post op care is so lacking. If he and his team provide the minimal amount of after care as is, this isn&#39;t viable.

Yup, they&#39;re given to every patient of McGinn&#39;s for at least a month post op, along with a variety of supplements and diet advice.

You really shouldn’t go down to smaller dilators, and if it’s tight and hurts you need to dilate twice as much really.

<p>
Parkside actually supplied me with the smaller orange pre-dilator on my first dilation because the purple one wouldn&#39;t go in without me screaming in agony. Soul source obviously make them for a reason and Parkside had them available so they know that they are sometimes needed.

<p>
Also a Bellringer patient with a similar result to OP and I&#39;m still on neuropath pain medication at almost 2 years or i struggle to sit on my office chair for more than an hour.

<p>
Yeah that&#39;s Bellringer only as far as i know. Tina Rashid let&#39;s her patients have a PCA for at least 48 hours then tramadol for the rest of the stay if they need it and that&#39;s in Parkside, plus she will give you a 7 day supply to take home before you can see your gp to get more of you are still in pain. At St George&#39;s you get a fentanyl PCA for seemingly as long a you want.
</p>
<p>
My gp gave me tramadol on day 10 and it was the first time post op after the PCA ran out after 21 hours that i was not in serous pain. For some of us nerves are damaged, sutures are in the wrong place or he just rushes and screws us up leaving us with long term issues that he refuses to acknowledge or fix.

I had my surgery with bellringer. I&#39;m sorry for your experience though I wonder how much was specifically his fault. I might do my own write up and post some pics. His bedside manner post op is difficult when you are in that vulnerable state.  Everyone gets morphine only for a day as feeling as it slows down healing process it did for me as my blood pressure and Oxygen dropped severely from using it and spent extra day in bed on full oxygen as a result. It was put down to being to reliant on it. Once took away I had 1 really bad day from over counter only painkillers though if you really need more they will look at it. I want to be balanced. For UK options I am happy enough with my results I had to drop to the thin orange and stayed on it for 2 months with no issue. I still have full depth. My labia was massively swollen at start but just had major surgery. They got better through course of year. They still puffier than my preference but not horribly so. Bellringer does revisions but I can&#39;t be bothered enough go through pain. They about average I seen for UK. Bellringer does bury the clit a bit more than some though I can identify easy with mirror and works great. You may want ask at checkup to identify as I struggled find due swelling.  As my insurance paid and would only cover UK surgeons I am happier enough and all my friends who been with him are happy to. Though if had option again I would pick Rashid for bedside manner. But don&#39;t lose hope. Most your issues are likely fixable. You can get revision and surgical dilation which may help. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to blame uti and swelling stuff though. This is part of healing and could happened anywhere. People experience pain different to which not your fault. I really think you should ask for revision though they usually say wait to 6 months.
