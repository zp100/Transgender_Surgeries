<p>
Had an simple bilateral orchiectomy with Dr. Kowalczyk (with the Urology Group of Southern California, in Los Angeles) back in September of 2021, and figured it was worth writing up about.
</p>
<p>
I chose Dr. Kowalczyk on a whim after being recommended him (and a few other people) by the LA LGBT Center, and would definitely recommend him. He was nice and friendly, and still took precautions for potential future SRS/GRS even when I said I wasn&#39;t interested.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-op/Op
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Insurance coverage for the procedure required two psych letters, which I got through a group counseling session (by Zoom) via the LA LGBT Center. They just require you to sit through two meetings where they&#39;ll discuss surgeries, how to find doctors (and reviews for them), potential complications, insurance coverage, etc., and then they&#39;ll provide you with the letters. Would definitely recommend this if you&#39;re looking for psych letters. Plus, if you need another set of letters for another procedure, you don&#39;t need to sit through the meetings again.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a number of various tests that have to be performed and
<em>
have the results sent
</em>
during the two week timeframe before the surgery (not any earlier, unfortunately), so make sure to get those done ASAP. This also involves getting a covid test
<em>
at the hospital
</em>
48 hours prior to the surgery, so things get a bit busy transportation-wise.
</p>
<p>
Was recommended by my endo to skip E (injectables) for a week before the surgery due to a slightly increased risk of blood clots, which I did, but it was optional. I was able to take spironolactone until the day before the surgery, though.
</p>
<p>
Surgery was done under general anesthesia, so I was completely unconscious during the procedure, and I was able to leave the same day after recovering from anesthesia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Visuals/function
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Visually, the area looks pretty much identical to how it was before, just deflated, I guess? Not saggy, just smaller. There&#39;s no visible scar, but the midline &#34;seam&#34; along the scrotum&#39;s missing for a cm or two right at the base of the penis. There&#39;s still a bit of a bulge from the excess skin, especially when it&#39;s colder out, but it flattens out fine after tucking. Haven&#39;t noticed any shrinkage of the skin yet, but it&#39;s only been a couple of months.
</p>
<p>
Sexual function hasn&#39;t really changed after surgery: libido shot up a lot right after surgery (which tends to happen after a shift in hormone levels), but it settled back down to normal after a few weeks; erections, fluid consistency, etc. are still the same as pre-op.
</p>
<p>
Haven&#39;t really noticed much in terms of increased feminization after the procedure, but I also don&#39;t really pay attention to my body too much.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
(Lack of) Complications:
</em>
</p>
<p>
Recovery went fine without any issues. Didn&#39;t have any bruising, hematoma, infection, etc., just typical swelling after the procedure. I did keep the jockstrap on the entire time (as recommended) and heavily iced the area, which might&#39;ve helped.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Day of:
</em>
</p>
<p>
After the surgery, there was a dull internal pain (presumably where they cut the spermatic cord), but not any noticeable pain at the incision site. If I could describe it, I&#39;d say it&#39;s similar to the lingering feeling you&#39;d get after a strong hit in the nuts.
</p>
<p>
The pain wasn&#39;t too bad as long as I was laying down on my back, but sitting up made things hurt, and standing even more so. There was also an unholy amount of gauze packed against the wound site, which also made things more uncomfortable. I could slowly waddle around to go to the bathroom if needed, but it was painful, and removing the jockstrap to go also aggravated the pain. Bending down was near-impossible. I was able to remove the gauze after the first day.
</p>
<p>
<em>
First week
</em>
:
</p>
<p>
I spent the first two days just lying in bed on my back, which made the pain bearable, but because I could only stay in one position, my body got extremely sore. Lying down in any other position wasn&#39;t really possible because of the pressure it&#39;d put on the area. I was pretty much just fading in and out of sleep around this time, since I would get tired a few minutes after waking up, but the pain made it difficult to get some decent sleep.
</p>
<p>
I was given some hydrocodone for pain relief, but I was trying to avoid taking opioids, and the pain wasn&#39;t bad enough to justify it. Tylenol was ok (which I unfortunately didn&#39;t have), but I was told to not take Ibuprofen because of increased bleeding risk. Heavy icing definitely helped with the pain, though.
</p>
<p>
At day 3, the pain let up enough to let me take a shower and get some decent sleep. The actual incision site was covered in some hardened liquid plastic, so washing the area wasn&#39;t an issue, although touching it was painful due to the swelling.
</p>
<p>
At day 6, I could actually stand and walk (still more of a waddle) with minimal discomfort, although prolonged standing was still impossible. I could also sit up in bed, but couldn&#39;t sit for long periods outside of bed. Minor physical exertion still wasn&#39;t possible, as even some intense button-pushing while gaming made the pain flare up.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Week two
</em>
:
</p>
<p>
Around this time, the pain subsided enough to let me get out of bed and sit at my desk for most of the day, which was a nice change of pace. I masturbated for the first time after surgery, which wasn&#39;t painful in itself, but I ended up going a bit too hard, which made the pain flare up, forcing me to rest in bed for a day after. Walking improved a lot (still had a wide stance), but bending down was still difficult.
</p>
<p>
<em>
4 weeks:
</em>
</p>
<p>
Barring physical exertion, I was pretty much able to do anything I need to around this time. I was told I could stop wearing the jockstrap after this, but I kept it on for another week as taking it off was uncomfortable. Still had a bit of a waddle.
</p>
<p>
<em>
6 weeks:
</em>
</p>
<p>
At this point, I was basically fully recovered, and was told that I could swim/bathe/etc. Stitches were mostly dissolved (not all of them), but the wound site was still covered in the liquid plastic. This started peeling and chipping off around this time, and was gone in a week or two. After the plastic came off, the skin underneath was a bit tender, but not painful.
</p>
<p>
There was still some swelling inside the scrotum that faded away in the next few months, although I can&#39;t pinpoint the exact time frame.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
General thoughts and unorganized commentary
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The surgery was definitely worth doing. Tucking went from being near-impossible (varicocele + large testicles) to extremely easy, and getting rid of Spironolactone is definitely a big plus. Actually being able to stay hydrated and not having to pee every 30 minutes is good enough, but it also turns out that spiro can make you susceptible to motion sickness.
</p>
<p>
Other notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Initial surgery consult was during mid-July, so surgery was scheduled a month and a half ahead
</li>
<li>
Cost for the surgery was around $3500, with insurance (albeit a low premium/high deductible plan)
</li>
<li>
For icing, I&#39;d recommend getting one of those old-school refillable ice bags, since they can spread out to cover the whole crotch area. I was given a small tubular one after surgery, but that one was only able to cover the incision site, which didn&#39;t help with the internal pain. Use crushed ice (or smaller ice cubes) though, since larger cubes tend to be a bit pokey.
</li>
<li>
Re-freezable cold packs aren&#39;t recommended, since they tend to be too cold and too hard
</li>
<li>
When preparing entertainment during recovery, prepare some shorter videos you can binge for the first few days
</li>
<li>
Depending on the jockstrap you&#39;re wearing after surgery, you might end up getting some numbness on the top of your thighs. It&#39;s not an anesthetic complication.
</li>
</ul>
