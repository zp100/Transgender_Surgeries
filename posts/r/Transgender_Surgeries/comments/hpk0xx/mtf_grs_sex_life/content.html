<em>
I&#39;m writing this while I&#39;m drunk, so uhm just straight off my chest:
</em>
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s say I cannot describe how amazing it is to actually be able to enjoy it to the fullest.
</p>
<p>
Going through all this pain and effort just to be normal ironically makes it a very special thing to experience sex the way it should have been from the beginning. If feels very good and just right.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a &#34;your experience may vary&#34; thing.
</p>
<p>
I was very lucky with my outcome and I don&#39;t feel limited in any way. What makes this so precious for me is that I didn&#39;t expect it to be good in the first place. It wasn&#39;t for sexual reasons but to get rid of the dysphoria. What I got was way beyond my expectations and I couldn&#39;t be more grateful for that.

So far it’s only been solo for me, but it’s soooo much better! Like, whole body, can’t walk for 10 minutes afterwards, can’t stop smiling afterwards good! 😀
</p>
<p>
Like
<a href="/u/MyUntoldSecrets">u/MyUntoldSecrets</a>
, I didn’t pursue GCS for sexual purposes, but to alleviate genital dysphoria — which was 100% successful — but this is a happy side benefit!

I would say it‘s very affirming, both masturbation and intercourse. After my surgery I had a lot of problems opening up because of the prior shame I felt when I was still pre-op and that seemed to tunnel into my experiences post-op plus being treated as a piece of meat by doctors post-surgery didn‘t help either (doctors and nurses have to constantly look at your result when you‘re still in the hospital bc of possible bleedings and stuff, which is exactly what happened to me and the constant looking, poking and exerminations distanced me quite a bit from my genitals). I also had a problem with tightness (was corrected later). This all went into my relationship with my vulva.
</p>
<p>
Once I accepted that this is all psychological and I could change it my sexuality transformed. I had sex with my bf yesterday and it was super affirming but foreplay and a lot of lube is required (I would say if you wanna have penetrative sex let the partner use his/her/their fingers to widen you a bit and only then have sex). As you can imagine this is quite a hassle sometimes and that‘s why I mostly have a-sex instead of v-sex. Don‘t let this bother you. Take your time.
</p>
<p>
The sex itself not only feels amazing bc you are having sex with female genitals which is super affirming in my opinion but is also feelings-wise awesome when your partner knows how to stimulate the prostate and play with your clit at the same time. I can have pretty good orgasms who feel like waves. Dunno how else to describe it. So yes, sex can be very good but be sure to think about your genitals as part of your female body and begin to have a relationship with them that is not marked by shame or pain. Hope you‘ll get what I‘m writing. It‘s sometimes not easy to answer someone when english is not your native language. 🙈
</p>
<p>
Also: Cunnilingus does nothing for me and neither does directly touching my clit but touching the skin above the clit and rubbing it is amazing.

Question, so what do you mean by tightness corrected later.

The vaginal entrance sometimes has the tendency to become too tight because of scar tissue which prevents you from having sex or in more extreme cases from dilating the neovagina. Dunno how they correct it but it worked for me.

Oh ok. I was just wondering because I’m 3 weeks post op and I can’t get to depth on my wide dilator. I’m wondering if I can get it eventually by continued dilation or if I’m in trouble.

That‘s normal. Your vagina is probably still swollen. I couldn‘t get the biggest one in until the second month. Just continue and do as the other commenter said: small for depth, large for width. And pls continue dilating the whole year, I think I lost some depth bc of it so I only have 10 to 11 cm nowadays (4.3 inches).

You need to maintain depth with the smaller dilator while continuing to use the larger one.

Dildo inside until you reach the prostate (you will feel her, it‘s far more sensitive than anything else in the vagina canal), massage that until you come. Bingo! A bigger dildo helps.

I did not have a sex life before my surgery. After it has been amazing. I have never needed lube as my vagina heavily self lubricates and men even often comment on how extremely wet I get (like if I am riding I sometimes flood their stomach, for example). I am lucky, I guess? I can get vaginal and clitoral orgasms.

It’s been pretty tough, honestly. As another commenter said, foreplay and lube is important. But it’s awkward because people who aren’t in our position don’t have to do that to the extent we do, so your partner might not be used to the idea.
</p>
<p>
Like I’m often too tight, and if your partner is male like mine - it can be demoralizing as he is struggling to “get it in.” Then you end up super tense, and he loses his erection. It can really ruin the passion of the moment. But if you can find someone who will be patient with you and understanding, I’m sure it can be great. I’m still trying to figure it all out. 🤷‍♀️

Just touch the skin above the clit and rub it slowly. That‘s basically it. You can feel the clit pretty easily bc it‘s bigger and harder then the rest of the vulva, almost like a little hill.
