Had it at Flamingo surgical center. I went under general anesthetic. Surgeon was Dr. Casey McCraw. Total billable cost should be  about $2,600 but insurance is covering it so I might pay as little as about $700. I was given a cotton jockstrap packed with gauze to wear for the next 3 weeks. I was also given an antibiotic and percocet rx.
</p>
<p>
I arrived at 6am, I went under at 7am and woke up at 8:30am. By 9:30am I was home. Pain leaving was about a 6/10 and kept me from being able to doze. I&#39;m on my 2nd percocet now(3:45pm) and pain is about 3/10. I&#39;ve peed twice now without issue.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions or chat.

How are you feeling? Physically and state-of-mind. I imagine relief would be a common feeling?

Physically like I&#39;m recovering from surgery. Sore, tired, moving slow.
</p>
<p>
Mentally I don&#39;t think it has really been processed yet but feeling good and hopeful for the future. I&#39;m happy to have it behind me as it has been 2 years in the making since I started saving, planning, and educating myself.

Good to hear you’re doing well! If you don’t mind me asking— where’s a good place to get started with research on surgeries and surgeons? Disclaimer— I’m not trans, but my best friend is, and I’m helping her get started with researching bottom surgery. She’s still in the process of deciding if it’s right for her, and we’ve been having some trouble finding factual, unbiased resources.

I had a hard time researching surgeons. I ended up going to the one recommended by my therapist. But full gcs or vaginaplasty is a plastic surgeon not a urologist. Finding doctors who are trans friendly is a difficult process. Especially if trying to stay local.

Not necessarily. Vaginoplasties are done by a wide variety of surgeons from general surgeons to plastic surgeons, to urologists and gynecologists. I’ve seen pediatric surgeons do it (because in the old days they did the vaginoplasties for intersex patients). Whoever is trained and comfortable doing them and believes their board certification has them covered. Bowers is a gynecologist by training. Gladys Ng is a urologist.

Good to know. I probably should have clarified that it was UNLV medical that wouldn&#39;t do my orchi but would do my vaginaplasty if I wanted to and my urologist only does orchi and not vaginaplasty. But thank you for clarifying and keeping me from spreading misinformation.

Not to correct you or anything - my urologist also does vaginoplasty procedures. He did my GCS as well as my orchy prior to that.
</p>
<p>
If it helps anyone - I was referred to him for orchalgia problems from my HRT provider,  and he (the urologist) suggested the orchy due to the pain I was having (chronic orchialgia - had two black out episodes from the pain)..  it was at THAT point I found out he performs GCS because he saw I was transgender and wanted to know if I wanted to have the orchy or wait till I have bottom surgery.  At that point I started discussing gcs with him.

No worries!  It&#39;s difficult to find good solid info on this subject sometimes, so just wanted to make sure it was known that there can be others that do it. ;)

What surgical procedure does he use? Inguinal incisions or through the scrotum?

Centerline scrotal incesion about 1.5&#34; long and minimal scaring for possible future vaginaplasty. Heard really good things about the scar being invisible when I was reffered. He partners with a plastic surgeon to do the vaginaplasty so  he works to minimize scaring.

Thank you for this info, he sounds like a great surgeon and I am absolutely going to reach out to him. Do you know if the cost included anesthesia and facility fees?

The billable costs I was quoted pre surgery this would be my out of pocket if insurance fucked me over and paid nothing.  Surgeon: $343 Anesthesiologist: $997 (1 hr surgery)  Surgical center: $1287

That’s incredible, even with my lousy insurance, it would cost me about $4,664 due to high deductibles for orchiectomy in Southern California. Do you know if he requires letters from mental health professionals.

I’d definitely like to hear more about your experience because I very much want to undergo this procedure. I would like not only my testicles removed but the scrotum as well. It’s a very strong desire and, while I can get this done through the VA, they have a ton of rules to follow before they would consider it. I have money set aside and want to get this done ASAP. Your thoughts on the surgeon, what they ask Pre-procedure and can I get permission from you to contact them. Thanks....

I was advised by the surgeon to not change anything about my HRT. I spoke to my provider and they said I can stop taking the Spiro after surgery but obviously keep taking my estrogen. I have bloodwork in 2 weeks and a hrt follow up in 3 weeks. Hoping to switch to  injections and add progesterone. I took the last dose of Spiro after surgery just in case there was residual t floating around. I don&#39;t plan to take anymore Spiro.
