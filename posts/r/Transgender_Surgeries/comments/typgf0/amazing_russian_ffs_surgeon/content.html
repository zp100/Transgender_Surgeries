<p>
Well i wanna introduce the trans community to an Ffs surgeon based in Russia- St.pertersburg, maxillo-facial surgeon with 24 years of experience, which is perfect to feel safe, his name is dr.Konstantin Matveev. honestly, i fell in love with his work instantly after watching his work on Instagram and also after hearing the famous trans MtF youtuber Erika speaking about her experience with this surgeon, he did a fantastic job on her, she looks stunning.
</p>
<p>
For those who are interested by this topic, i&#39;ll leave the links down here. check them and tell me ur opinions it would be interesting for me to hear different points of view.

<p>
i know it&#39;s all in russian but it is worth the hassle! lol anyway i think the doctor speaks english, i&#39;m not sure from it but if u send him a message in Instagram he will usually answer also i was told he provides online consultations so this is a good point.

Is Russia actually trans friendly?
</p>
<p>
Pretty sure they throw gay citizens into jail for even displaying a rainbow flag or being &#34;visibly gay&#34;. I can&#39;t imagine the FSB would be exactly thrilled to have Western trans people visiting. Maybe they&#39;d be more friendly to non-Westerners, but eh.

I have a gay male friend from Russia and he told me that trans women are kind of accepted if they are heterosexual.
</p>
<p>
Then it&#39;s like: yeah she is mental but at least she is not gay and wants to be a &#34;normal&#34; woman

I think passing or not is okay. but i think showing lesbian behavior isn&#39;t acceptable there. however i see that in most of the countries being lesbian isn&#39;t very disturbing straight people as being gay.

I think for the moment it&#39;s calm in Russia, i see lot of his patients publishing his recent surgery results, so i think it&#39;s not a problem to get a visa and travel there for an Ffs. but i&#39;m here to discuss his work what do you think about it?

Yeah! especially for the price for this amazing work, the surgeon will perform forehead, chin and jaw on me for only 4921€ this is very affordable especially for getting such an amazing work!

Apart from the usual concerns, I&#39;d be worried about how sanctions might affect flights and payment. Not just for the surgery, but revisions later in case of problems. Its very unpredictable right now.

Another Russian FFS surgeon recently left, see this post 19 days ago.

I can see.  well i don&#39;t know why she has quit Russia while it&#39;s still calm there however if the flights will be less because of sanctions, i&#39;ll just take a flight to Finland-Helsinki and then take the from to Russia-St.petersburg! it&#39;s only 4 hrs by train. i thought earlier about the issues that can happen and their solutions. personally i wanna do it and travel there cuz in my point of view, i don&#39;t see that it&#39;s a big risk!

Could be personal reasons, or maybe she knows something you don’t.
</p>
<p>
It’s very uncertain what’s going on now. If you wait a bit it might become more clear, or maybe too late.

Uh no - it&#39;s Russia.  They are the worst place in the world to be right now.  They attempt to undermine and screw with freedom and elections all over the world to prop themselves up then they invade a country and kill it&#39;s people, who are basically their own cousins.  I would never trust a Russian at this point.

We are not here to discuss politics, all i know that i lived in Ukraine for 8 years because of my studies as a trans person and everything was good. Russia is the same thing, lot of trans women travel there to get their Ffs done and everything go alright in terms of safety. watch Henchagram Ffs vlog on youtube. she documented all her experience!

This is bad advice at this time considering what has happened to Brittney Grinner.  It looks like a clear case of an American (Lesbian) citizen being framed to be held as a political hostage.  Thailand or anywhere else in the world is a much safer option right how.

My point had nothing to do with acceptance and is about lgbt people being particularly vulnerable to becoming political prisoners/hostages in Russia.

I’ve seen a lot of people being concerned here about the state of trans/gay rights in here, so i thought i’d clear that up.
</p>
<p>
It is true that the state of them are horrendous right now, but it’s probably not for the reasons you think.
</p>
<p>
The worst thing about Russia is having basically 0 protection for us. People committing hate crimes seem to be organized and the judges seem especially keen on giving assaulters very low charges. A trans woman has been decapitated recently and the murderer has only received 3 years on account of “overstepping self defense boundaries”.
</p>
<p>
In regards to the law itself, the infamous “anti gay propaganda law” doesn’t actually forbid anyone from being explicitly gay. There are a lot of LGBTQIA+ folk here, especially in the capitals.
</p>
<p>
Trans medication is probably actually easier to get than in any European country, since most pharmacies don’t require for you to have a prescription. I’d still recommend for you to get the meds with you though.
</p>
<p>
If you still do decide to go, beware that, amongst other things, getting a visa is also pretty difficult. Not a lot of people know english comparatively to Europe, so you’ll have to use translator a lot.

I will do as for whatever reason I feel as this post will get a lot of hate …
</p>
<p>
Also his price side right super low or suspicious as it reflects other Russian surgeons - they also operate around this cost

All the russian surgeons have low prices because of the currency, however it doesn&#39;t mean that they are not expierienced it&#39;s just because this is the pricing quote in that country. i know lot of russian Ffs surgeon also experienced but with same low prices!
