Around a week ago I pulled a hair at my groin while showering and felt it tug slightly at my vag as it pulled out. I was disturbed to see the hair had this slightly firm jelly around two parts of it with bits of blood:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/nldfyyvbs8x71.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f42914527f89caf009f2a664b889e7de5905e1f">https://preview.redd.it/nldfyyvbs8x71.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f42914527f89caf009f2a664b889e7de5905e1f
</a>
</p>
<p>
I couldn&#39;t tell exactly where this pulled out of but bleh.  I&#39;m also not sure what could have formed that gel stuff that trapped blood.  It looks kind of like the green slime I was occasionally seeing a couple months ago but is much more firm.  I haven&#39;t felt any pain or had any other issues since I removed this so my best guess is it was a clump of hair that got into a weird place and started irritating things till I pulled it out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I think I massaged things too hard and/or too frequently because I went through a week or two where things got much more painful.  Especially sitting in the car or at restaurants took longer to stop hurting and when I got up, pain was often intense for a few minutes.  So I stopped the massage and once things finally quieted down, the type of pain and places I hurt has definitely changed.  Pain is less sharp and more diffuse.  Some areas that used to hurt a lot when I rubbed them now hurt much less.  I&#39;ve also realized that pain is caused much more by pulling or sliding then skin than by pushing it.  So like spreading my legs or having panties slide on the skin causes pain but pushing down on it isn&#39;t bad.  It feels counterintuitive.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCgBV6Y28N0">This vid
</a>
has a lot of info about pelvic physical therapy in general.  She said therapy should never hurt and that it should feel like a good stretch.  Yet she also describes doing an internal massage and if a patient says an area hurts 8/10 in one spot to move to another spot that&#39;s a 3/10 and then when you go back to the first spot it will tend to be more like a 3 instead of an 8.  So I&#39;m confused there, but I think the general idea is what I&#39;ve heard elsewhere - you need to touch and move things to make them change or heal but you shouldn&#39;t push them into intense pain.
</p>
<p>
So I think massage is good but I need to not do it too long or too hard and I need to back off if it causes too much soreness the next day.  Same with sitting in my chair - I&#39;m targeting one hour a day instead of rushing to full time.  I&#39;m also using the hot packs 2-4 times a day.  They basically cause swelling which always makes movement more sore for 20-40 mins after I remove the heat but I assume they&#39;re helping.  I&#39;ve also learned to avoid anything that increases swelling starting at least 2 hours before bed or side sleeping becomes too painful.
</p>
<p>
My overall pain level the last few days is definitely less than the week or two before, but compared to a month or two ago it&#39;s hard to say if pain is any less.  It&#39;s certainly different - less sharp, more sore, and it&#39;s in different places and has different triggers.  My vaginal canal tends to be more sore after dilation than it used to be and I always feel some soreness after I sneeze which never used to happen.  It&#39;s possible this indicates sensation is increasing in more areas rather than some kind of regression in healing, but I really hate it either way since it feels like things are worse in some ways instead of better.
</p>
<p>
I feel like dilation is taking way too much time every day so now and then I try skipping the morning one.  Usually I feel punished by things being tight during evening dilation and I often can&#39;t get the blue one to full depth, but sometimes skipping morning doesn&#39;t seem to affect the evening.  I&#39;ve been trying to understand the inconsistency.  After watching some pelvic floor therapy vids I&#39;m starting to think it has to do with how flexible the pelvic floor muscles are and how relaxed they are.
</p>
<p>
I tried the breathing and visualization from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcecJr_VTzc">this video
</a>
and it seems to make dilation somewhat easier.  It&#39;s not a dramatic improvement but I&#39;m usually able to keep the dilator at full depth without the intense pressure I used to use.  I think the intense pressure was doing some damage, maybe even near the canal entrance, because things have gotten less painful since I backed off and there&#39;s less soreness after dilation.  I also think I&#39;ve lost up to 1cm of depth over the last few months but trying to keep it was causing too much pain.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also discovered that dilating is most comfortable when I have my legs out almost straight, knees on pillows with knees around 18&#34; apart.  It also helps to let the bed hold my butt cheeks together for some reason.  It seems counterintuitive to keep my thighs so close together while dilating but I think it all helps shorten/relax the pelvic floor muscles so they can be spread by the dilator.  But it also bothers me I need to do that new position when I used to dilate without pain with my legs spread much farther.  It makes me think things are gradually tightening internally instead of loosening.
</p>
<p>
The last couple days I&#39;ve also tried some exercises from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcecJr_VTzc">here
</a>
and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c875p_tXO0s">here
</a>
that are supposed to relax pelvic floor muscles.  It&#39;s too early to tell if it&#39;s helping though I think it&#39;s made some of my leg muscles sore the next day.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m rather mad I can&#39;t find a single person talking about what exactly they did for physical therapy after a vaginoplasty.  Maybe it&#39;s very different for every case but nobody has said that, either.  I can&#39;t find any reddit threads or youtube videos specifically for post SRS physical therapy.  So I have to find a doctor.
</p>
<p>
I researched physical therapists and called one and they said I need a referral from a general practitioner.  I tried to explain Blue Shield PPO says I don&#39;t need a referral but they want one anyway.  I talked my contact in Blue and she said individual specialists may have policies like that.  So having a PPO plan has rarely been of any benefit as most specialists want you to go see a GP first anyway.  I asked Mozaic for a referral and they said they can&#39;t give one because they&#39;re also a specialist.  Blue contact said they could refer me but Mozaic feels they haven&#39;t seen me in too long to offer a referral.
</p>
<p>
So I hunted through a few GPs, skipping one with no appointments for a month and will be seeing one this week.  I also managed to make an appointment with a gynecologist next week without seeing a GP first!  Of course the receptionist had to go check with someone first to make sure that was alright with my health plan.  And they warned me they couldn&#39;t refer me to a physical therapist because they&#39;re a specialist (even though that shouldn&#39;t be true according to Blue).  Thus why I needed the GP appointment.
</p>
<p>
So we&#39;ll see if either of the doctors can help and then we&#39;ll see how long it takes to get physical therapy started...  The PT I&#39;m trying to see currently has appointments within a few days so I hope it remains that way.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I realized today that going from closed legs to more open legs pushes the dilator out, but if I work the dilator in deeper with open legs, there is sensation I never get with closed legs that makes me think it might be going deeper than with closed legs.  So I worry closed legs is squeezing the flesh to make it bulge and so the dilator looks deeper than it really is, in which case I haven&#39;t been getting it as deep with closed legs.  It&#39;s really hard to be sure.

11-5-21 mini update:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Just got back from the general doctor.  She said healing looks good other than the skin is somewhat red.  She said there&#39;s no infection and the burning/sore pain I describe sounds like overly-sensitive nerves.  She put me on gabapentin for nerve pain and referred me to physical therapy.  She also said a lot of people need 12 months to fully recover from major surgery (I didn&#39;t get the impression she had any extensive experience with vaginoplasty surgery) and that cold might also help (which it did).

</p>
<p>
I saw a gynecologist two weeks ago.  She made me bleed working the speculum in part way and said the tissue looked raw and &#34;needed a lot of healing&#34;.  She also said there was granulation tissue and the skin looked broken and friable.
</p>
<p>
I was devastated.  So much time healing, 2.5 months of steroid cream, and it felt like I&#39;d gotten nowhere on healing the vaginal canal.  I dripped a few spots of blood on the floor after the exam and had to get panty liners to catch it.  Luckily I didn&#39;t bleed too much so the thin liners caught it all.
</p>
<p>
She prescribed me estrogen cream to be inserted in the vaginal canal with a little injector.  The injector the cream came with was terrible and makes me bleed if I don&#39;t have enough lubricant inside from dilation even if I lube the injector.  Luckily, I had an injector with a rounded tip (similar to
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Launchers-Precision-Mess-Free-Lubricant-Applicator/dp/B07QQ4V3X8">this
</a>
) that I originally got thinking it could be useful for dilation lubrication, but it was never necessary for that.  I pull out the plunger and put the cream in the back end before reinserting the plunger and pushing the cream to the front.
</p>
<p>
The gynecologist feels the estrogen will make the skin thicken and heal.  She said the skin on my labia is also very thin and suspects that&#39;s why it hurts to pull or slide. I&#39;m a little skeptical that &#34;thin&#34; skin would cause the pain I felt but she said rubbing estrogen cream on the labia should thicken it as well.  In the photos above, labia skin does look less crinkly, saggy, and waxy compared to the 11-2 photos, so maybe the estrogen actually had a significant effect.  I&#39;ve also had a number of dilation sessions where the labia majora don&#39;t stick together at the bottom like they are in the photo and that pretty much never happened before a few days ago.  I think redness also reduced though my camera is so random with the amount of red/blue tone it puts in things that I can&#39;t be sure.
</p>
<p>
What I can say for sure is that in the last few days, I&#39;ve had a remarkable reduction in labia pain.  Three days ago it was close to zero for around 24 hours.  I slept with legs together and didn&#39;t have the usual few mins of pain whenever I shifted or whenever I got up.  I could touch the lower left labia and press it down with almost no pain.  The next day, pain was more noticeable but rarely above a 1/10.  Yesterday I drove and there was little pain sitting in the car and little getting out.  A week earlier pain would always be 2/10 or more for a couple mins after I got up from sitting but now it&#39;s closer to just vague soreness.  All of this had me really happy.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know how I made so much progress so quickly.  I suspect gabapentin is a significant part of it, which is the most frustrating explanation since I can&#39;t be on painkillers forever.  I started it 11/5 and ramped up to 900mg over 5ish days so I&#39;ve been on full strength for a couple weeks.  It&#39;s supposed to start taking effect after a week and take up to 4 weeks for its full effect.  When I did electrolysis today on my upper lip and below my nose the pain seemed around 30% less intense than I&#39;m used to and I&#39;m pretty sure the gabapentin must be responsible for that.
</p>
<p>
However, I&#39;ve also been doing daily massage.  I work over the whole labia scar with two fingers doing a gentle twisting motion, then press fingers flat on labia and rub gently in circles.  I originally started massage on 9-3 and back then both labia hurt to press and I could feel hard lines like undissolved sutures under the skin.  It was around then my pain started getting worse and I strongly suspect it&#39;s because I massaged too hard.  But I also suspect that my body tends to encapsulate sutures, keeping them more dry so they don&#39;t dissolve.  Instead they just sit there causing inflammation.  I had the same experience when I had facial surgery.  There was constant pain from the sutures and they didn&#39;t dissolve when they were supposed to.  In that case, the surgeon removed them and I was pain free within 2-3 months.
</p>
<p>
As pain worsened over the weeks, I stopped massage and didn&#39;t start again till around 10-16, at which point I went more gently.  I was feeling fewer hard lines but there was always an elongated lump running the length of each labia towards the lower end.  Touching it hurt and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s inflammation, possibly caused by little broken bits of sutures.  I put that theory to the doctor but she couldn&#39;t confirm it.  Whatever the cause, it gradually disappeared on the right, and now in the last couple days, that lump disappeared on the left as well.  I feel like this is the true reason I&#39;m no longer feeling much pain, but I won&#39;t know for sure until I stop gabapentin.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks ago I could still feel hard lines going from the two points above the clit hood that were oozing scabs for so long in the first 3ish months.  But as of a couple days ago, the final hard line can no longer be felt and pain when I push that area is much reduced.  So I&#39;m hoping that suture is finally almost gone as well.
</p>
<p>
And the final possibility for pain reduction is the estrogen cream thickening the surface skin.  If that had an effect on pain I suspect it&#39;s more about preventing pain when I tug at the skin.  The transudate I ooze can make panties stick to it and that&#39;s always hurt significantly to pull away from my skin but that pain has gotten to be very minimal the last few days.  Whether I can thank estrogen or gabapentin or both, I can&#39;t be sure, but I am thankful.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
My main focus at the moment is healing my vaginal canal.  Dilation still hurts but it&#39;s improving very slowly.  At the recommendation of the gynecologist, I stopped using the blue dilator and moved back to starting with orange and not pushing purple in beyond where it hurts.  It was really hard to go back and lose so much progress but after the speculum it hurt way too much to use blue anyway.
</p>
<p>
Since I started to accept my dilation pain was likely due to granulation/raw tissue more than tight muscles, I thought I should probably be using steroids again.  I asked Mozaic and they agreed, so a week ago I resumed using steroid cream.  In the internal pic above, I&#39;m stretching the skin at the bottom to the right trying to get a better view of the vaginal canal.  It&#39;s now red instead of white but I don&#39;t know which is better.
</p>
<p>
At this point I can usually hold orange at full depth without too much trouble.  For some reason, I always have to shift by butt cheeks around and generally pull them together to get the last bit of depth.  Unfortunately there&#39;s always this painful area a couple inches in that hurts a bit to push through no matter how much I relax or go slowly.  The pain mostly goes away after orange has been past it for awhile, even when I pull orange out, but going through that area with the purple dilator hurts again and I think it sometimes causes slight bleeding.  So I think I have to give up on purple until orange becomes painless, but we&#39;ll see what the gynecologist says.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I finally saw a pelvic physical therapist after fighting red tape with the doctor&#39;s referral department, my insurance company, and the PT&#39;s intake department.  Basically, the referral department said they couldn&#39;t refer me when I had a primary care physician (PCP) outside of the referrer&#39;s local network.  I needed to call insurance to remove my PCP entirely or switch it to a doctor in the referrer&#39;s network.  I&#39;d tried to do that back in February and Blue Shield said I couldn&#39;t remove PCP and they couldn&#39;t find any doctor in the referrer&#39;s network even though the network itself was within Blue&#39;s coverage area.  But this time when I called, the person I spoke to was able to remove my PCP easily.  It&#39;s maddening how many different answers I get every time I call Blue customer service.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, at the PT, since my labia pain was doing well we didn&#39;t talk about how that might be treated (I suspect she would have said massage was one treatment) but we did talk about the internal tightness.  The usual treatment for that is to insert a finger or tool around the size of a thumb into the vaginal canal and press the muscles in certain ways.  They can also insert electrodes and deliver little shocks.  Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t think any of that was a good idea when my gynecologist described things as raw and needing healing.  PT said healing the vaginal canal is a balancing act between keeping the skin supple and stretchable without pushing it so far that it can&#39;t heal.  If not stretched at all it can form scar tissue that&#39;s painful to break up later.
</p>
<p>
So I must wait for the gynecologist to say internal PT work is ok.  Until then, the PT said she can work by pressing my perineum externally and by doing stretches.  Unfortunately there wasn&#39;t time for the perineum pushing since we talked for so long about my medical history and about what to expect with PT.
</p>
<p>
She pressed my pelvis where it points forward at both sides and decided it was rotated a bit, I think with right side too far down when I was on my back.  She fixed this by having me on my ack with my knees bent and feet flat on the table.  She then pushed my right leg away from my head and pushed left leg toward my head while I resisted her pushes.  I felt this most as tightness left of my belly that became a little painful at times.  She said having a rotated pelvis can cause possible spasms or tightness in the pelvic floor but I got the impression her adjustment wasn&#39;t likely to have any huge effect.
</p>
<p>
We went through a few exercises and she said my range of motion was good and it doesn&#39;t sound like I suffer from any serious pelvic floor tightness or have any internal pelvic pain.  She said my dilation pain was probably a mix of tight muscles and skin that wasn&#39;t healed.
</p>
<p>
The biggest exercise she recommends is to lay on my back with bottoms of feet together for 5-10 mins while focusing on diaphragmatic breathing and feeling the pelvic floor relax on each breath in just like the first exercise in
<a href="https://youtu.be/c875p_tXO0s">this
</a>
vid.  She later said you don&#39;t have to keep focusing on the relaxing, just make sure to keep diaphragmatic breathing going while you watch TV or whatever.
</p>
<p>
You can stretch additional muscles by keeping that same feet-together position but lift your feet up high and grab them.  Pull them toward your head for 10 secs, then relax.  Repeat 3 times.
</p>
<p>
She also said
<a href="https://youtu.be/c875p_tXO0s?t=264">this
</a>
was good but instead of sitting up straight (which most people lack the flexibility to do), lean away from the outstretched foot with a hand on the floor.  You don&#39;t need to pull in any particular direction, just hold that position for maybe a minute with legs on one side, and a minute on the other.  Stop if anything hurts or feels strained.
</p>
<p>
She sent me home with this paper describing the other exercises she demonstrated during the session:
</p>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<p>
Things went well with the gynecologist this afternoon.  My SO was able to drive me this time so I could lay on my back on the way down to reduce swelling and the appointment was later in the day which also makes me less tight.  I asked the PT yesterday about why dilation at night is always less tight than morning and she said it&#39;s because muscles loosen as you move around.
</p>
<p>
The gyn used a smaller metal speculum this time instead of the larger plastic one.  The plastic one apparently has a light so she had to have an assistant aim an external light but the speculum went in almost painlessly this time and she was able to see to the bottom.  We were both shocked to find wads of hair compacted into the end of my vaginal canal!  It looks likely to be mostly comprised of my head hair which gets everywhere, but I&#39;m really surprised to see so much of it because I always look for it with a mirror before putting in a dilator.  Occasionally I find a hair stuck to the dilator when I pull it out but apparently some of it just stayed in.  Ugh.  What she pulled out is rather horrifying:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/zobjr85kyh181.png?width=2072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aefa28c131f0c3cb53d01be87cd20aa5fb2c2a4">https://preview.redd.it/zobjr85kyh181.png?width=2072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aefa28c131f0c3cb53d01be87cd20aa5fb2c2a4
</a>
</p>
<p>
The right wad is what she first pulled out and the left one was the deepest wad with the most gunk around it.  She said the hair was likely contributing to inflammation and pain, although I didn&#39;t feel much of anything when she pulled it out.  I think it&#39;s likely the hair wads were the source of the green slime I sometimes found and they must have been slowly building up for the last nine months.  Except Dr. Wittenberg did an internal speculum exam six months ago and didn&#39;t find any hair, so... how could it have only started after that point?  I feel like Wittenberg must have somehow not seen the first hairs, maybe because things were too swollen to see to the bottom?  I&#39;m really frustrated that none of the doctors or nurses warned me hair could even be a problem and I&#39;ve never seen any post-op people mention this.  I once asked the surgeon if hair could get stuck in there and she said it would just work its way out.  To be fair, I was asking about little hairs left after shaving, but still...
</p>
<p>
If I&#39;d known stuck hair was a possibility I would have been more proactive about seeing a gyn.  In fact I wish the doctor at any point had said &#34;If you&#39;re not coming in for physical followups, you
<em>
need
</em>
to see a local gyn.&#34;  Maybe I misinterpreted, but seeing a gyn always seemed like a suggestion of something I should do eventually, not an urgent thing.  I was hoping to wait until Jan when I switch health insurance back to Kaiser because I hate frequently switching doctors, especially on something so intimate.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not even sure what I can do to prevent more hair getting in other than squat and take a photo of the internal parts before every dilation to be sure there isn&#39;t a hair lurking.  I&#39;ve rarely seen one on the labia majora when inserting the dilator and I&#39;ve always used a mirror to do that insertion, so somehow they&#39;re getting in between the labia while I shower or somehow wedging under my panties or who knows what.  To try to reduce stray hairs, I&#39;ve set an alarm to daily brush my hair and I used a silicone broom (similar to
<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Evriholder-Sw-250I-Amz-6-Furemover-Squeegee-Telescoping/dp/B000EFDOOA">this
</a>
) to rub all the hairs in the carpet into balls that went into the trash.
</p>
<p>
Gyn said the labia skin looked much better and agreed it was no longer glossy, waxy and thin.  I&#39;m really surprised only two weeks of estrogen could have such significant effect.  I was expecting a month or two before much improvement if it worked at all.
</p>
<p>
She said things looked significantly better internally and the skin was more stretchable so she could get the speculum in.  She applied silver nitrate to a few spots of granulation internally.  She said it might burn but I didn&#39;t feel it except in one spot where she slipped and things moved suddenly.  Even then pain wasn&#39;t that bad and I wasn&#39;t feeling much when I left or when I sat in the car.  There was no bleeding or discharge as I put on panties but she said there would likely be at least charcoal colored discharge.
</p>
<p>
As the evening progressed there ended up being a fair amount of blood and dark grey discharge caught in my pad and I changed it two times before bed.  We went out to eat and I was hurting faintly after sitting during dinner so I had SO drive while I lay in back again.
</p>
<p>
Gyn said to resume estrogen cream internally starting tomorrow, and to resume dilation with steroids in two days.  Continue external estrogen 3 times per week.  See her again in 3-4 weeks.  She said I could start internal PT work in a week if there&#39;s no bleeding or unusual discharge or much pain with the orange dilator.  I should stick with only the orange dilator till it goes in easily without pain.
</p>
<p>
In summary, I&#39;m really happy to have the gross hair out and I hope that plus the silver nitrate will lead to some good healing in the next couple weeks.  I&#39;m frustrated Dr. Wittenberg didn&#39;t see the hair at three months and that she didn&#39;t apply silver nitrate, instead prescribing steroid cream that didn&#39;t work.  It probably works on most people but I&#39;m just unusual.  It did work on the bit of granulation above the clit so I assumed it worked internally as well.  It&#39;s also possible that it worked but I pushed larger dilators too quickly and re-formed it.  I should have seen a gyn earlier to be sure.  I&#39;m also happy to be having so little labia pain but worried what will happen if I stop gabapentin.  Hopefully the massage will help me heal properly sooner rather than later.

11-30-21 update (38 weeks, 8.7 months post-op):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I showered the day after my gyn visit, I pulled out a ~3/4&#34; diameter sheet of white stuff that I later realized was skin!  When I took a photo later that day I saw where it had come from:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/0858b3dtru281.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c93f3591bcd4df9c7789c906d48b366b6ffd91">https://preview.redd.it/0858b3dtru281.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c93f3591bcd4df9c7789c906d48b366b6ffd91
</a>
</p>
<p>
I think the red area is where the sheet of skin came from and there&#39;s similar looking skin below it that&#39;s been stained grey by the silver nitrate.  This scared me wondering how much healthy skin the gyn had killed.  Looking online, it says you&#39;re supposed to use Vaseline on healthy tissue around the granulation tissue before applying silver nitrate carefully to just to the granulation.  I imagine it&#39;s too tight to do that in the vaginal canal but getting it over such a big area of healthy skin seems rather sloppy and I had no way of knowing how much skin was damaged in the canal itself.
</p>
<p>
Four days later, the damaged area looks almost normal which is a big relief:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://preview.redd.it/em9pwzkwsu281.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1882a17943aa812a32d04347a2c082ed5fd4005b">https://preview.redd.it/em9pwzkwsu281.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1882a17943aa812a32d04347a2c082ed5fd4005b
</a>
</p>
<p>
The red area of granulation in the canal itself doesn&#39;t look much better though which really sucks.  When I tried dilating in the evening with the orange dilator the second day after silver nitrate, it hurt significantly and I had to stop with it less than halfway in because it hurt too much to push further and I didn&#39;t want to damage things.
</p>
<p>
The next evening I used the smaller purple dilator and managed to gradually get it to full depth without major pain but it hurt more than before silver nitrate.  I then tried the orange dilator and got it to the last dot visible before it hurt too much to continue.  There was no blood on either dilator, thank goodness.
</p>
<p>
Two days later, I was out driving and sitting to eat for like 6 hours total.  I had some minor pain in labia but usually only when I got in/out of the car and considering how long I was driving, things went surprisingly well.
</p>
<p>
I took a picture before I dilated and found a hair stuck between labia that wasn&#39;t visible from the mirror with legs spread as wide as possible.  I think because things are wet/sticky in there, as soon as a hair sticks to it, it&#39;s more likely to keep working deeper instead of pulling out.  Eventually, the whole hair is pulled in and can&#39;t be seen.  It really sucks.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, I got the orange dilator to full depth for the first time since silver nitrate but it hurt a bit to keep it there so I stopped after about 4 mins.  It still hurts to insert both dilators but I think the pain level is now close to what it was before silver nitrate, or possibly a bit less in some areas.  I&#39;ve decided to skip morning dilation at least till I can dilate painlessly to give the tissue more healing time.
</p>
<p>
Also yesterday, my panty liner had only one spot of yellow and it was less brown and much smaller than usual.  Today the discharge was faint yellow and could barely be seen.  This may imply the browner discharge I used to get contained blood as the gyn thought and that I&#39;ve finally stopped bleeding from granulation.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve also noticed the worst smells from my groin have not returned since the last gyn visit.  I used to need to douche 2-3 times a week to keep down the smell but I avoided douching for a whole week after the silver nitrate because I was worried the douche nozzle (ha) would damage things.  Even after those 7 days the smell wasn&#39;t bad, so I wonder if the hair and/or the granulation tissue was the main cause of foul odors.
</p>
<p>
It was also interesting that the discharge on my pads is now appearing toward the bottom of the pad instead of at the top where it always used to appear.  This may mean swelling is down so things can come out at the bottom instead of pushing to the top?  Or maybe it means my labia aren&#39;t sticking together as much as they used to.  There seems to be less discharge overall and it doesn&#39;t feel as sticky so that may contribute to looser labia.  I&#39;ve also had more instances of pee going straight down instead of off to the sides.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I had my second physical therapy visit today.  The gyn said not to do any internal manipulation until I can insert the orange dilator easily and painlessly, and I&#39;m certainly not there yet.  So we instead worked on my lingering labia pain.  She used gloves and a small amount of lubricant to do gentle rubbing and pulling of the scar tissue on my inner thighs close to the lower parts of the labia.  I guess she could feel where things were &#34;tight&#34; which indicates scar tissue that pulls and causes pain as I move.  She asked where things hurt to touch and focused her pulling/rubbing near those areas though usually not too much directly on them.  Basically, she&#39;s trying to break up and soften scar tissue.  She said it would hurt but the pain rarely got over 1/10 and the most painful parts were 3/10 for short periods.
</p>
<p>
Later, she gently pulled the labia apart and rubbed them back and forth.  It hurt at a 1 to 2 level.  She said the skin seemed delicate and should be treated gently.  She also said to keep using the estrogen cream and expect the area to slowly toughen up over time.
</p>
<p>
She said I could do similar massages at home but wait a couple days to see how I react to her manipulation.  I should expect to be sore but if it&#39;s not too sore she will go harder next week.  She said to never go too hard with the massage or you can reverse your healing progress.  She said the same applies to dilation - don&#39;t force it or the skin could be injured and tighten rather than loosen.  I suspect that&#39;s what happened to me after I stopped the steroid cream months ago.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, she said to avoid using heat but I can use cold to control pain if I&#39;m sore.  Heat is something I was using a month or so ago because I read it could increase circulation to aid in healing but I guess it&#39;s counterproductive in my case for some reason.  I should have asked.
</p>
<p>
She had me demonstrate how I was doing the assigned stretches and she corrected my understanding of a couple of them.  I edited in my instructions in the 11-23 section based on what she said.
</p>
<p>
When I sat in the car after the session I felt like my groin was less tight.  There was a bit of soreness but it was different than before and felt like an improvement in some way.  Once I got home things were a little sore so I put ice on.  I hope all this will lead to a complete elimination of pain sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
Dilation tonight was amazing! By far the least pain I&#39;ve ever had doing it!  I got orange dilator to full depth and kept it there at least 10 mins.  I can&#39;t believe I went from so much pain a week ago to so little now, especially after so many months of no progress.
</p>
<p>

EDIT: I finally got my refund from St. Francis Memorial Hospital!  I go into detail
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/m4ia2x/comment/gr0lk4d/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here
</a>
but basically, SFMH billed $125+$144k = $269k.  On the $125k bill, Blue Shield paid ~$10k and said I owed ~$1k.  That claim was originally denied saying the hospital hadn&#39;t submitted something properly but was revised and paid about six months after the procedure.
</p>
<p>
The $144k claim was denied showing &#34;these charges have been denied as the provider/hospital did not comply with the prior authorization requirements. As a result, there is no member liability for these charges.&#34;  The claim was never revised so I don&#39;t know if the hospital actually did fail to properly follow some sort of prior auth procedure or if they decided the $11k they got actually did cover everything or what.  I feel like the services provided by the hospital itself certainly shouldn&#39;t cost over $11k even if the surgical robot has a high initial cost and maybe has high maintenance costs.   Either way, I paid SFMH ~$3k before the procedure when insurance said I only owed ~$1k.  I was finally issued a ~$2k refund in late Nov which I didn&#39;t learn until today.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s crazy how much they claim the procedure costs compared to how little they get paid for it by insurance.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeDOQpfaUc8&amp;t=1s">This vid
</a>
goes into some reasons why medical prices are so high and scammy.  But it&#39;s insane to see them bill over 10 times more than they actually get paid.  Imagine if people could get the procedure for its actual cost without paying for-profit insurance companies...
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Dr. Wittenberg and her staff got $24k from insurance and $6k from me which feels very steep from a practical standpoint but I don&#39;t begrudge her the money since she gave me a great gift.  But that would mean paying $41k if we could get the same procedure without insurance which is still beyond the reach of most people.  I still think there&#39;s a huge profit margin on that price.

So when I talked to Dr. Jun at Crane Center, his staff sent a referral to a pelvic floor PT practice because I
<em>
specifically
</em>
asked about it during my consultation.
</p>
<p>
Like you, I feel as if this is something that is not as widely known in the trans community as it probably ought to be.

I think the problem is after the initial excitement of the surgery, almost everyone stops posting about their experience within the first month or two.  So the variety of things that can happen after that is a huge mystery to the community.  It&#39;s really frustrating but I&#39;ll keep sharing my journey till I&#39;m fully healed.

how physically active are you in general? what exercises do you do, and how has this changed pre and post op?
</p>
<p>
have you been able to use the orange dilator? have you had penetrative sex yet? what does your doctor think about your trouble dilating, have you talked to them, are they responsive and open to dialogue or questions with you?
</p>
<p>
i think you’re healing beautifully. what was your hair removal process before surgery? have you seen a gynecologist yet?
</p>
<p>
best wishes to you!!
