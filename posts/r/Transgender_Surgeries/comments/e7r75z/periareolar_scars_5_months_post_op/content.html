Uh, what scars?? They look phenomenal!!! Iâ€™ve been considering Dr Z too- youâ€™re a poster child for great results ;)

If you don&#39;t mind me asking... What size did you go with? Silicone or saline (I&#39;m guessing saline)? What size we&#39;re you before? Did you do any expanders before or if they were saline did you progressively add volume? Do you notice any rippling?

I have saline moderate profile, and smooth. 380cc in left breast and 420cc in right breast. And no I did not use expanders and I had it added at once. And yes I did have some rippling in the bottom right part of my right breast that has significantly decreased in appearance but there is still a very slight remnant of some rippling in that one area, absolutely not worried about that tho and I donâ€™t even notice it anymore with how slight it is. I do have a couple stretch marks on my right breast unfortunately from getting breast implants too soon after growing/ while Iâ€™m still growing.. they arenâ€™t that bad and I wouldnâ€™t trade them for my old breasts any day, overall I am very happy with my results and would never change my mind even with the two stretch mark lines on my right breast. They look very natural and people donâ€™t even know that Iâ€™ve had an augmentation when they see them:)

Thank you for sharing! How far along were you in your transition when you got them? Also, what size we&#39;re you before?

I was maybe a small b cup before or aa. And I was about 25 months in my transition. He said that I had an abnormal amount of swelling as well unfortunately.

That was one of my biggest qualms going into periareolar for the incision method but it has been ever so slightly decreased only on the scar. But the actual nipple is 100% the same. I donâ€™t notice a difference during sex. And I would choose my scars any day over some under the fold ones Iâ€™ve seen. The scar heals so well since it heals pretty much the same color as the the nipple too.

Your areolas look kind of big. I wonder if your results and the preservation of nipple sensation would remain the same for those with smaller areolas. Also, what reasons would one have for having this surgery versus one from the armpits?

Well my doctor didnâ€™t offer that method... thatâ€™s the method I wanted and I still think itâ€™s the best.

Thanks, yeah great results, definitely I&#39;ll remember this and would be something I&#39;d look into if I were to ever get a BA.

I wish it was better quality. But otherwise, they look great.
