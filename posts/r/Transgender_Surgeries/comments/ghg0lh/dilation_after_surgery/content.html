In all seriousness, is dilating after grs really all that necessary?

I got real sick 6 months later (like, life threatening infection in another part of the body) and couldn&#39;t dilate for like 1.5 month, and lost over 1 inch from 7.5 to 6.
</p>
<p>
Recently I&#39;ve regained a bit to about 6.5 with the small. Still working on the width though.

Do you think after a long time it would be less necessary? 5+ years?

There’s some people who have stopped dilating for 10+ years and not had a problem, but they didn’t do that in the early years post-op.
</p>
<p>
There might be something here

After the one year mark, if you&#39;re having regular penetrative sex, some surgeons will say there&#39;s no need to dilate. First 6 months to a year is pretty crucial, after that it&#39;s possible you won&#39;t permanently lose depth, though not confirmed. Width you can usually get back.

I have no idea. Maybe? Some people report not dilating anymore.

I went to Dr. Suporn so keep in mind this was a skin graft not a PI.
</p>
<p>
Well. I stopped about 3 years after the surgery for maybe 4 months to see if it would change anything. Then I checked again.
</p>
<p>
I got slightly tighter and it was all back to normal after 1-2 sessions of dilating. No depth loss at all.
</p>
<p>
At that point I just thought ok - It&#39;s super unlikely that I wont shove something up there in such a time span.  I stopped entirely and nowadays with how frequently I pleasure my self this concern is completely gone. I still occasionally check but nothing changed in those 5 years I stopped so far.
</p>
<p>
If you ask me after a couple years post-op it probably isn&#39;t all that important anymore. But make sure to check for yourself.

Of course!!!?
</p>
<p>
In this surgery the doctors basically Create a Cavity let’s say 8 or 7 inches in depth.
</p>
<p>
It’s a foreign cavity in your body, your body will start closing this cavity if Constant dilation  doesn’t happen, you’ll basically end up with 1 or 2 inches in depth.

Yep. I stopped dilating because it had taken such a huge mental toll on me, 6 months later I&#39;ve now lost all my depth.
