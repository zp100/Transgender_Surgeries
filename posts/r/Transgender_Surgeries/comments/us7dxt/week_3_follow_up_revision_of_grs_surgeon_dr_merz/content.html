I can&#39;t do it as precise as the last 2 threads since I&#39;m at home and nothing really is happening, except I got sick yesterday and therefore the thread is coming 1 day late again.
</p>
<p>
Douching my vagina (not my vulva) is kinda interesting cause don&#39;t know how but it&#39;s hard to find her for myself ðŸ˜… and since I&#39;m not going in with my finger it&#39;s harder to navigate the catheter I use for that
</p>
<p>
Also since I&#39;m still not allowed to dilate nothing new on that front
</p>
<p>
And my appointment with my gynecologist is in like 2 weeks so I also can&#39;t say what she is thinking of the newer kitty
</p>
<p>
If you still have any questions just go ahead :3
</p>
<p>
But till now it&#39;s like more pics for this and the next week, guess with the 3 months update I&#39;m able to write more details again

I would always go again with the team (since you can&#39;t choose the exact surgeon there)

Hmmm ðŸ¤”
</p>
<p>
With my knowledge now, i guess I just would ask more about how often and long to dilate, if douching is permanent, when starting to apply E3 creme to the scars better
</p>
<p>
Something like this, cause that&#39;s a major problem, the communication, if you don&#39;t ask they assume you know ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
But that might be cause I have had a lot of notes what to take and had a lot of questions in the first appointment already answer

Oh tbh i would love to know the answer to those questions ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
Dilation i have found a good schedule for me, 30 min each dilator size i use (last months pre revision was going down to 15 minutes)
</p>
<p>
Douching: i have stopped doing it regularly at like months 7? And they haven&#39;t said anything bad in the examination for revision surgery
</p>
<p>
E3 creme I&#39;ve done like with starting dilation or shortly after after first surgery
</p>
<p>
But yeah those stuff can change with revision (especially since I still have the stiches and have to wait till they go away themselves) and I didn&#39;t asked those questions to begin with ðŸ˜…
</p>
<p>
My questions were kinda different: (German)

Look out, English only, so I&#39;m gonna answer in English, but you can always chat me up with questions
</p>
<p>
The orgasm is different, yes i would say slightly more intense then pre op, but HRT has done way more in this terms
</p>
<p>
What do you mean with peeing backwards (srsly, never heard of this)? It&#39;s just a spurt to the front and since revision it&#39;s more to the front then down
</p>
<p>
Wasnt anywhere at public changing rooms, got my first surgery in August and it needed 5 months till i was comfy taking a bath at home, then revision came short after, so maybe in like a few months i can answer that one (but i still don&#39;t like Public changing rooms, cause yk they are public)
</p>
<p>
If you have more questions, just go ahead :3
