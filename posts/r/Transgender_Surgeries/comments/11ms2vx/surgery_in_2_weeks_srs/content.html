About to have my bottom surgery at the 23 this month and I will have to choose (also depend on doctor suggestion) between PPV and Colon
</p>
<p>
So far I been leaning on the PPV because it is easier recovery and some more benefits that honestly I am not sure of if true like less dilating and such.
</p>
<p>
I have read about both PPV and colon pros and cons and the more the time closing in the more doubt I have for which one to choose and getting more nervous.
</p>
<p>
In short:
</p>
<p>
Colon : More promised depth? More experience over the years. Easier to dilate to keep depth? Hard recovery and pain. Optional smell?(heard mixed opinions about this)
</p>
<p>
PPV : Can get smaller depth and easier to lose depth? less experience over the years. Harder to dilate to keep depth? require less dilating in future? Easier recovery and no bad smell?
</p>
<p>
The most important things for me from the surgery is in order from most important to less:
<br>
1.Aesthetics 2.Depth (Partner) 3.Sensitivity 4.Easier dilating 5.Easier recovery with less pain
</p>
<p>
Any suggestions or thoughts that would ease my mind and help me choose would be appreciated thank you

If your #1 priority is Aesthetics why don&#39;t you ask your surgeon for some pics of outcomes they&#39;ve achieved so you can base your decision on which you prefer?
</p>
<p>
I discussed PPT with my surgeon compared to PIV at some length. The appearance is a large difference between the two. The peritoneum typically stays attached during PPT and, given this, it often wants to contract. This pulls the graft inwards reducing the appearance of labia minora. You end up with more of an innie than an outtie. If &#34;good aesthetics&#34; for you includes prominent labia minora then an alternative to PPT might be the best choice for you. If &#34;good aesthetics&#34; doesn&#39;t include prominent labia minora then maybe PPT is the best choice.
</p>
<p>
Arguably, you&#39;ll have sufficient depth with both.
</p>
<p>
With sensitivity it&#39;s typical for a vagina to have the most sensitivity on entry, but going for more could be fun! If this is very important then combining the information you already have with the aesthetics might be the deciding factor.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t have any knowledge of the remaining two points but hopefully the above helps you to navigate the decision making process a bit :)

My experience with dr kamol ppv srs after 4month
</p>
<p>
The truth about ppv with doctor kamol : 1 -Less dilating in future its not a truth at all because after 1 year you need to do 3 time dilitation in week  2 -yes you can loose depth easily  3 -you will need to eat just soupe for 2weeks and after 2month you can start to eat normally but you will have strong constipation after weeks of surgery and the constipation will continue for months but not to strong  4-yes its tight for dilitation specialy when you start to use number 4 its really tight and you can have some blood after dilitation. 5 easier recovery yes its truth but after surgery be ready for the gaz in your estomac its painful specialy when they stop to give you morphine . 6-for esthetic honestly its you and your luck because some girls have good looking vigina and others no ,and dont think that the doctor he will do exactly what you will tel him or if you show him a picture its not truth.
</p>
<p>
Honestly for the price of ppv i dont recommande because it doesn&#39;t deserve it at all because all the benefits like stretch vigina and less dilitation and self lubricant its all lies , honestly technique of doctor supporn are more intersten and he do good looking vigina like cis women with good depth but healing after surgery are hard so i hope you will take the good decision.

It&#39;s not decision about the surgeon anymore, I have surgery next week with Kamol.
<br>
Thank you for the information, I might be going for the Colon method instead my original plan for PPV.
</p>
<p>
Overall you are happy with your results and aesthetic? I seen your post and to me it looks great.

Good luck to you ‚ù§Ô∏è The good things that the hospital are very clean and the nurses are so nice specialy in garden hotel they are amazing and all the stuff to so you will feel in secure. If you want to do colon method pliz dont be alone because healing is very hard and emotionally it will be very hard to you to

Ty glad you have a good time, I already did 12 laser sessions and few electrolysis before.
<br>
And they also do more electrolysis in my package deal when I get there. I don&#39;t have hair left.
<br>
I think with colon it doesn&#39;t matter to have hair removed too.
<br>
I am going with my mom so I should have help, still colon very scary for me it&#39;s hard recovery.

I was talking to my surgeon yesterday about PIV vs PPV vs Colon. My surgeon warned against the colon technique because of excessive fluid production, she said some patients have so much fluid that they require heavy flow pads 24/7.

Something similar about excessive wetness has been said by at least 1  credible post op user in the sub. It may be a low number of patients, but it&#39;s not zero. Seems like it would be beneficial if there was a way to identify patients who might have this issue prior to surgery.

What surgeon are you going to that said PPT gives you less depth? that&#39;s hugely suspect since any surgeon doing a non-PI technique should measure and harvest grafts that fit the maximum depth your body is capable of.

The depth issue came up a lot when I searched about PPV in general with any surgeon and it seem it&#39;s easier to lose depth with that method. Most from reddit search results and few I personally talked with.

No, its not &#34;easier&#34; to lose depth, but it depends on your surgeon and their technique used. Anyone Bluebond trained never desiccates the peritoneal abdominal graft from the abdominal cavity, so its always anchored in the back. It is much harder to lose depth with PPT than with PI, but you must follow your surgeons dilation instructions regardless of technique.

ppv can also be penile-preserving vaginoplasty but obv that&#39;s far less used.

I think PPV and PPT are the same thing. Thank you for sharing your experience.
</p>
<p>
I find it hard to decide which method to go for, both seems to be good.
</p>
<p>
Also like mentioned in my post, I am not sure what is true anymore there is lot of mixed opinions on the net

PPV= Penile peritoneum vaginoplasty, which is essentially the same method that Dr. Min Jun uses.
