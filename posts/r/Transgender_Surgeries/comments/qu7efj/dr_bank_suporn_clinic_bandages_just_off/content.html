I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m posting this as there&#39;s not much to see.
</p>
<p>
But because I didnt do much research beforehand, I just wanted to know if everything looks okay for this stage?
</p>
<p>
Dr Bank said theres still very much swelling so I won&#39;t be able to see clitoris etc and he said everything went well in the surgery.
</p>
<p>
But of course hes going to say that lol. Not doubting him for a second! But no surgeon is going to say to their patient &#39;nah, shits fucked&#39; ðŸ˜†
</p>
<p>
What do others think? I dont really know what to expect due to lack of research lol. That&#39;s my fault.

You just had surgery, itâ€™s very normal for there to be lots of bruising and swelling. Looks good so far! Congrats and happy healing

Yeah, thanks. The surgeon didn&#39;t seem concerned and said some of the swelling could take months to go down so I&#39;m not overly worried.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m just an anxious person and hope everything looks as should at this stage. :P

I definitely feel that anxiety. My anxiety has been a thing that&#39;s made me scared to start looking into SRS as I&#39;ve had really debilitating medical-related anxiety. Like cripplingly bad. Like even getting my blood drawn to start HRT was a giant hurdle to start and taking the medicine for the first time took me a long time due to my absolute terror with medical related stuff.
</p>
<p>
So with that said I&#39;m empathetic to anxiety around this. I hope people&#39;s comments in this thread can ease your anxiety.

Congratulations.
</p>
<p>
Had my bandages off yesterday by Dr Suporn (Tuesday, Thai time), looks similar to you except I have more swelling I think and a little different at the top. It&#39;s all too swollen to kind of work out much of how anything will look like later. So I&#39;m just not concerned about it.
</p>
<p>
Really enjoyed that first shower, felt so fresh and clean after it. Got a laugh out of nurses as I even used my foaming eyelash extension cleaner.
</p>
<p>
Just would like this catheter out. Amazed at how little pain there has been, basically none at all. Dr Dilaka must have put a spell on me. Went to push the green morphine button once just for fun but it was already gone, not needed.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I&#39;ll see you sometime later in the Ratt, I&#39;ll be moving there tomorrow.
