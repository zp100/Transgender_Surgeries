Great! I had jawline, chin, and trachea shave. No loss in sensation.

I will be returning for the rest in the future, my financial situation took a hit after consulting everything I wanted.

Thank you, I can finally look up now and not hate my reflection. I wish I did the surgery sooner, but finances are one of our gatekeepers unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s quite friendly, after that I&#39;m too awkward to really gauge people accurately.

I find him friendly also. He&#39;s been amazing about answering my questions, especially given how much of a bother I&#39;ve been.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s just hard to gauge his skills at nose revisions since I don&#39;t have a lot of results to go on.

He gave me a pretty much perfect forehead. Can&#39;t say anyone else could have done better.

I tried to schedule and they said I need to arrive 2 weeks before my surgery to self quarantine. I noped out. Fuck that. I can&#39;t take a month off work. I might as well just book Keojampa for next year

Unfortunately I&#39;m the only on here who does my job and so I will never be able to get 4 consecutive weeks off. Guess I&#39;ll keep looking for other doctors.

I haven&#39;t heard much about this surgeon before. Is he more low key but produce great results and no botched cases?

I&#39;d say he&#39;s an up and coming surgeon. He&#39;s one of Spiegel&#39;s proteges along with Keojampa. I&#39;m probably going to book him for my own revisions. There&#39;s some results posted in the FFS Facebook group.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not heard of anyone being botched. His forehead work is impressive and I like his nose aesthetics.

Yeah had a look at his website. He seems very meticulous. He seems to be the type that gives a customised surgical plan based on the individual. I agree his results do look natural and the no botched patients is a good thing. Unlike the Dutch Menace, who gives the same plan to everyone cause he is lazy, takes so much risks and goes chop chop all the facial bones cause he thinks no bones equals feminine and he doesn&#39;t require a CT scan or MRI. Anyway, hope all goes well for you.

I had a similar experience with my original surgeon. No surgical planning and multiple aspects of my FFS were botched. My only concern with Dr. Mardirossian is that I haven&#39;t seen a lot of revision rhinoplasty results from him. However, he&#39;s communicated with me extensively about what he could do in terms of revision surgery and that&#39;s helped put my mind at ease.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s hard to trust anyone after being botched once but I don&#39;t have much if a choice and he seems very capable.

Yeah I feel you. But I think it made me a lot wiser and to be very sensitive to every single red flag. Getting good vibes and sharing the same taste in aesthetic with the surgeon are also very important. Who was the offender?

You should file a claim atleast and report him to the equivalent of general medical council in Chicago.

Some people say they won’t travel overseas because they can’t sue if there’s a problem, but I’ve never heard of anyone managing to sue a USA surgeon for any trans related surgery either. And there’s been more than a few cases.
</p>
<p>
In some states like Florida the surgeon not to carry insurance, and this also puts the lawyers off since there’s a low limit to how much money they can get.

I read one case for a botched BA where the clinic used doctors from overseas in Europe and flew them to the UK to perform surgery and the woman sued and she was awarded several hundreds thousands of pounds and the clinic paid for all her revision with a proper UK surgeon. She was not trans but she succeeded. The clinic is now defunct I believe. I wonder about my case but even if it doesn&#39;t get taken, a warning of the sort should be given. I don&#39;t know I just don&#39;t think cases like mine and others should be left unattended and forgotten. I have sent a report to Orde de Artsen.

Why is that? Is it for all medical negligence cases in your state or does it depend on severity? Yeah you should  cause then they receive a warning in their record or a freeze to their license.

The issue with plastic surgery is that results are never guaranteed. So you cannot make a case solely based on a bad outcome. You have to prove malpractice which is a lot harder. It takes a lot of money to litigate and so it really needs to be an open and shut with a lot of money at stake.
