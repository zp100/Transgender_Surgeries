Has anyone heard of examples where peritoneal tissue was reharvested to do a peritoneal revision to fix depth on the original peritoneal surgery? Or ... other options (besides colon). If so, which surgeon/s offer this?
</p>
<p>
I had my bottom surgery 13 months ago with Keiran Hart in Australia. I went in expecting a full peritoneal canal as that is what we had discussed and as i was being wheeled in for anaesthetics he told me he was going to do a PIV/Peritoneal hybrid. Disappointing aesthetics of my vulvasuarus aside, inadequate dilation instructions by Hart and his failure to take my post-op depth concerns seriously at the time I raised them mean I&#39;m left with a depth of only 5-6cm. This corresponds with the join between penile and peritoneal tissue and is the point at which the vaginal canal closed over. Vaginascopy by my gyno shows that I have about a half a little fingernail of peritoneal tissue in a pocket at the very end which is providing minute amounts of lubrication.Despite choosing the more expensive, more invasive and longer surgery and longer projected recovery time hoping that I would end up with a self lubricating vagina and a reduced need for ongoing dilation ... what I ended up with was a mostly dry penile inversion that is barely a finger length in depth.

The best thing would be to go to Thailand (either with Dr. Teerapong or with a PAI surgeon)

i&#39;m sorry to hear your surgeon messed up like that - all the best to you! &lt;3
</p>
<p>
i think it would depend on where he harvested the peritoneal tissue from with the first grs, at least some US surgeons use tunica vaginals (from the testes) which would mean that the peritoneal tissue around your organs was untouched and is still for use. otherwise i would imagine that many surgeons would only do sigmoid instead of a second ppv..

It may be an idea to make a few photos, and ask a number of surgeons.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
might be some examples and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic
</a>
might also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website.

Hart did the same crap to me around the same time and now I have to look at going to Thailand, no one in Australia can fix me.

Why are you opposed to colon, just curious, if you donâ€™t mind?

I donâ€™t want to be messing around with the colon as there is the potential for too much to go wrong. Plus the idea of stinky bowel juice discharge isnâ€™t very appealing. PPT seemed to me like the best option available

Jenunum? Iâ€™m not aware of this one. Which part of the body is it harvested from?

Just googled it. Would be interested to know what the potential drawbacks are harvesting from the small intestine.
</p>
<p>
Which surgeons do this surgery?
