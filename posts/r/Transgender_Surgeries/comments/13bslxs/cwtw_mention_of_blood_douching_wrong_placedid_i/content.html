So I’ve been doing my dilations and douching by myself for a week since coming back from grs Montreal but yesterday turns out I found out I’ve been douching my anus instead of vagina and when I went and clean and redid the douche I douched my vagina but then I started bleeding uncontrollable I went called the hospital and they cleared and said I stopped bleeding and I’m wondering if I screwed up anything bad or was that blood the blood that accumulated from not douching correctly.

Definitely contact GRS Montreal to let them know.

I don’t have personal experience dilating, but I’ve been to GRS myself.  Some blood is to be expected, but it shouldn’t be continuous. If it has stopped for now then that is good, if not then go to a doctor.

Are you sure you placed the nozzle of the douche inside of your vagina and not the urethra? That’d cause significant bleeding. Also don’t feel bad, all 3 holes are fairly close to one another.

Curious how you accidentally douched your anus instead? Can&#39;t you feel the douche going inside your anus? Asking so I don&#39;t make the same mistake when I go
