thank you for sharing all this with us! Also it doesn’t look gross, I’ve seen some people with 3-4 weeks progress and they had way more inflammation and issues, I hope yours resolve soon for you! It looks like you’re healing so well overall.

Fun fact: The extra incisions are from the micro cameras and tools going into you to construct the vagial cannel! You’re doing amazing babe. I’ve been using paper towel too the “v” area is a bitch to deal with. I also literally use peices of paper from my writing book to wave air infront of it to extra dry it too. 😂😂🐱🙄

I don&#39;t recall being told to keep the area dry, but I had PPT.  It&#39;s hard to keep it dry when blood and lube is dripping out of it.  I also had a tear on my left labia from dilating.  Overall I am glad to have Dr. Anger as my surgeon and UCSD aftercare is amazing.

Yeah I dont remember being told to keep it dry either. It&#39;s rather impossible considering all the dilation. I had a little scar tissue though.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Anger was my surgeon too.
</p>
<p>
I really enjoyed the week in the hospital (besides the pain) but after the week I was ready to go home.

You can ask for rectal Valium. It helps relax the pelvic floor and will make dilating easier.

Is that the dilator your Dr gave you?  Mine are totally different,  there soul sorce and taper with a little crook on the end. I have 5 of them all together in different diameter.  Was just curious 🤔.  I&#39;m  10 weeks post opp tomorrow. Pi method.  I&#39;ve had a time keeping Mine dry like down at my but and it stays really tender if I don&#39;t stay after it. I wad up a little fold of gauze and just tuck it in until it out of sight/feel and it helps.  Once you get raw and a little tear or anything it makes dilation really unpleasant.  They gave me a bunch of lidocaine lube in individual syringe without any needles of course,  you just take the rubber cap off and stick in in there and push the gell up in you and it numbs things up and Is super slick.  Congratulations girlfriend and I hope everything goes well for you.  Thanks for sharing.

Hard part is done she has you as her support. Everything else will fall perfectly into place. She needs to stay on track on dilation.

A lot of the stuff on the stomach was for drainage during the surgery.
</p>
<p>
As for keeping things dry, it can be tricky. Be naked often so you don&#39;t have moisture to worry about from underwear. Also, my care team had me douching with a betadine saline mixture and betadine is good to dry up a bit. There was also some sort of powder that told me to put on any sores that develop to help dry those up.
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t give you any guidance on how often you should dilate as every doctor has their own guidance for it and they know what&#39;s best for their surgery method.

I had the same type of surgery and I started with a smaller dilator. It was tan looking. The first thing I had to get used to was putting something IN me.
</p>
<p>
I think going up in dilator size was the hardest thing for me because at one point the canal stopped stretching and I had to literally force it in, leave it in, then take it out. And it was painful the whole time. And I think this is common. I had to have my doctor give me oxycondone to take before I dilated every time.
</p>
<p>
I dilated once a day cause more than that was a nightmare. I think I did twice a day sometimes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at the largest size now and I dilate between every day and every other day for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
I think it took me about 1 1/2 to 2 years to get to the largest size. But I was also lax with the dilation.
</p>
<p>
And I have to douche once a week with saline/salt water. Although I sometimes wait longer.
</p>
<p>
I also forgot to mention that when I went to the bigger size I would use the previous smaller size to &#34;warm it up&#34; then use the larger size and that seemed to make it easier.

Thank you for this information . I started with the second dilator and I dilate 5 times a day simply because I rather be an over achiever. I also see a pelvic floor doctor who recently put the 3 dilator in me there was no pain just a lil pressure. I will start using the 3rd dilator on Monday. I plan on using my new part asap so to wait a year to get to the largest dilator seems way too long for me. I’m hoping I can start have intercourse at the 3 month mark. My partners are being impatient lol.

I&#39;m happy for you, I hope it works out. I haven&#39;t use mine yet in all the time I&#39;ve had it - I think mostly because I haven&#39;t met someone?  I guess, but the time I did try he didn&#39;t fit cause I wasn&#39;t dilating like I should have been. But I also didn&#39;t expect to have intercourse.

Can I ask who your doctor is? I&#39;m curious because: is what I&#39;m leaning towards. I do have a doctor picked out currently. I&#39;m just curious who did yours?

This is amazing , thank for sharing.  Your healing is fantastic.  Dilation is hard, especially for the first twelve weeks but then it gets easier and you size up with relative ease.  I do 3x per day with 10-15 mins for each size, with 30 minutes on the last one… I am on the 4th size of soul source now, with just the last one to up to.

Did you have this done in all one step?

Or did you get zero depth first ?

by no means an expert as I&#39;m hoping I can even get surgery but I saw someone got it approved to just sleep with it in so they didn&#39;t have to do the dilation 3x a day. I have no specifics like if it was right away, x months down the line etc.

The pain is not so bad and last 2 weeks. Pain meds are here for a reason. Everyone has a different pain tolerance.

How long does it take to heal? How long should you keep it dry?

For now, It’s important to keep the raw areas dry so that they can heal. I assume it’s important to always keep your kitty dry to prevent bacteria and odors.

It’s actually healing good. Had an appointment with the pelvic floor doctor and I was able to size up to the number 3 dilator. Hopefully I won’t need a revision.

Sorry sis ..but I smell a revision for you in the near future. I&#39;ve had the colon method, and it was not bloody like that 2 weeks post op, and it did not hurt dilating with a dilator bigger than the one u have. The one you have doesn&#39;t even curve so that could also be a reason why it hurts. You could also have granulation tissue inside your 😺 that may need to be addressed. After a month...you&#39;ll know if a revision is needed...if your smart. My 1st procedure was done by that bitch Dr. Sibh Gallagher (penial inversion technique was used) who pretty much botched me. I could barely put any dilator In, my clit looked weird (she said it&#39;s fine, and that the swelling would go down...but never did), and I just didn&#39;t have much depth no matter how many times I dilated..and after a few months the hole just closed up. I knew within a month, post surgery, I was going to need a revision, and started the whole research process over where I soon discovered Dr. Del Coral (who saved my life). I got the colon method for my revision. He was fortunately able to fix everything. And because the vaginal canal doesn&#39;t close no where near as fast as a penial technique...I dilate once or twice a week without any issues. Of course sizing up can hurt, but other than that it&#39;s cool. Also, does your clit have sensation?

Hi-- I&#39;m 20 days post-robotic assisted colon vaginoplasty. Your clit-- like mine-- I would guess is so sensitive simply because of the swelling. Give it a couple more weeks and I think you&#39;ll start to feel that painful sensation ease and eventually become more pleasurable. The area I would follow up with your surgeon about is the pain in dilation. In my experience so far, dilation hasn&#39;t been painful (maybe a little uncomfy at times). Other areas of your healing are looking beautiful! I&#39;m amazed how little swelling you have-- she looks so good.

Just remember what I said…after about a month or so…you’ll know if a revision is needed. You’ll feel it deep down in your soul. And if you feel that’s going to be the case…go ahead and immediately start doing your research cause it could be a while to schedule you to get back on that table
