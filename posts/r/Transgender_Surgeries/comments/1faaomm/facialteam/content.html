FACIAL TEAM - NOT IMPRESSED - i just had a consultation with a doctor from facialteam regarding shaving of foreheadbone. I asked him about HAIRLOS around incison from ear to ear. he replied &#34;there is no hairlos , not with facial team&#34;. Which made me skeptical instantly,  because i know thats is a lie . in almost every single post youtube, reddit and facebook people are left with alot of hairlos around the incision from ear to ear from facial team. And their hairtransplants are even worse. And it is extremely visible in many cases. I dont think he liked the fact that i confronted him with this. He became standofish/arrogant instantly because i kept asking him questions. Furthermore he told they do a hairtransplant by removing skin from the back of the head in order to correct the hairline at the same time. RED FLAG!!! I had a hairtransplant before and spoke to at least 20 hair specialist(doctors) . No one uses this method anymore (cutting out skin) . And for good reasons. It limits the amounts of grafts u can use and i saw many bad hair transplant results from facial team that were horrible.  The surgon i spoke to finished his specialization 2 years ago , so he has alot of &#34;evolving&#34; to do. In no way did i feel comfortable putting my life in the hands of this doctor and i very much doubt the techniques they are using based -  on the information i have been given by 12 other surgons that do the same surgery.

Same thoughts to you Sarah. I have nothing negative to say (other than price but thats another topic) about their hair transplants.
</p>
<p>
Seeing as my follicles would have been discarded, I saw it as a net positive they could try and round out my hairline with them at the same time. Recovery was fine, good result in my case and they filled in a lot.
</p>
<p>
I don’t believe I have a higher hairline either after almost three years, when they round out the hairline, the new shape makes your hairline appear lower anyway. Initially you might see a slight increase in height, but the skin relaxes over a couple years.
</p>
<p>
The incision they make I felt would draw less attention to my hairline vs. a hairline approach, which often leaves a more visible scar.
</p>
<p>
OP, not saying this consultant didn’t say this, but in the information booklet FT provide about possible complications, they mention hair loss is a factor, but this would be the case with any hair transplant.

All these issues aside - the doctor was misinforming during my consultation and when i confronted him about his fals data ( there is no hair loss after incision) , he got hostile and seemed rude. That is a bad sign.

I had FFS with FT and my scar has healed nicely without hair loss. Only good things to say about their practice. Didn&#39;t need hair transplants, though.

FT doesn&#39;t do the hair transplants in-house, they sub it out.  Or at least that&#39;s how it was a couple years ago.
</p>
<p>
I ended up using them for FFS, and they did a standout job,  but I took a pass on the hair transplants. I&#39;ll do research and find one independently.
</p>
<p>
In terms of FUT vs. FUE... plenty of surgeons still do both,  and the FUE costs are higher.  I believe FUT doesn&#39;t require you to shave your head too, if that matters to you.

Every single example i saw from their hair transplant i i saw is bad and every single person was unhappy.  U dont shave ur entire head. U also rish hairlos and scarring by remiving the skin strip.

Again,  facial team doesn&#39;t do hair transplants. It&#39;s 3rd party,  so you&#39;re better off doing your own research and finding someone.

“You risk hair loss and scarring by removing the skin strip” (edited for grammar reasons). Well duh! They literal peel your fucking face off to shave the frontal bone! What did you expect, a vigorous massage?
</p>
<p>
Everyone has already told you all the ways you’re wrong, but from the tone of your post and replies you care more about complaining and being right than actually being informed.
</p>
<p>
Yes, there absolutely are legitimate concerns that should be discussed regarding such an invasive surgery, but with your attitude no one gives a shit your opinion.

they literally list and i quote &#39;widespread or localized alopecia (lack of hair growth) &#39; as a possible complication.  can you link the posts you mean because honestly from what ive seen most people seem fine. the reason they do it that way afaik is that the reduced browbone means excess skin so they have to cut a bit and obviously you avoid cutting someones scalp usually as that increases tension. not doing so also means you have a reduced harvest rate as some follicles become damaged if you extract it straight from the scalp

FacialTeam is the same weirdos during a consult who when I cited a before and after patient noting I was very impressed with said patient’s results and would like a similar change, the doctor in consult said “ah yes (patient name), I love that bitch.” Also I could tell the guy was very much talking down to me because I didn’t have pretty privilege. Whole experience felt fucking gross. Huge red flags, would never go with them.

I have had ffs with FT 2 years ago and have hair loss on the head incision. I went back for revision year ago and they did hair transplant over it.. non of the hairs survived and I have big bald scar on my head now.
</p>
<p>
It can happen with FFS and it depends on how you heal, so I don&#39;t really blame them...

I had a consultation with them a few years ago and decided to get a second opinion as their price tag was ridiculous for me at €37000. Another surgeon said get a nose job and hair transplant from specialists rather than FFS. I took his advice. I paid £7000 for the FUT transplant and it will be about the same for a nose job of I can face it at some point.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
RED FLAG!!! I had a hairtransplant before and spoke to at least 20 hair specialist(doctors) . No one uses this method anymore (cutting out skin)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Umm I think you will find that it&#39;s (FUT) still in use and has advantages for trans women. It does require more skill and time, I had 4 techs disecting my strip under microscopes for a few hours, alternating with a few others to insert them.
</p>
<p>
The most important being that they don&#39;t have to shave off a large portion of hair at the donor area. It has a higher success rate per follicle as they can be disected more accurately. Personally my FUT scar has healed pretty well over the last 4 months and my implants are looking amazing! I have no hair loss around my incision other than a amall shaved area each side that has grown back perfectly from what I can see.
</p>
<p>
I also think when facial Team do FFS plus hair transplant they use the same incision line to extract the donor hair.
</p>
<p>
The downside to having coronal or frontal incision is that the transplanted hair may still susceptible to thinning through exposure to DHT and Testosterone and therefore male pattern hair loss. If you have your HRT and levels sorted this shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue. With FUT from the rear safe zone this is essentially eliminated and improves long term results.
</p>
<p>
I would suggest you look elsewhere and get a few more quotes even if they cost a few hundred £$€ each. Keep your options open and don&#39;t do it unless you are sure.

facialteam does &#39;coronal&#39; through the back of the head if requested and you want hair from the back instead.

I had ffs with ft and that does not sound like my consultation? Who do you had your consultation with? To me they told me they dont do the incision on top but do it on the back of your head in case hairloss persists after surgery. The topic of hairloss on the scar was adressed by them before i could bring it up.  I‘m 10 months out and my transplant looks fine and same for my scar. Sure the transplant could be more, but they only had whats available on the discarded skin strip

I&#39;m not sure what you are talking about. I can tell you are resolved in your opinion. I believe the Facialteam not only has a more qualified team in Marbella but also in Barcelona. They are getting better and expanding to help even more transgender individuals.
</p>
<p>
As far as your description, I&#39;ve been under the impression of a cranial type, basically the go-to move which I received. I have NOT had hair loss. I also did NOT receive any follicle transplant. I have lots and lots of unwieldy hair. The cranial incision is NOT noticeable (ZERO- 0). You can check my profile and see.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so very proud of the work they performed on me. They saved my life and many more girls just like me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you had a bad interaction with your consultation. I wish you the very best in finding a surgeon.

Idk which doctor you went to, but all the ft I discussed with were straightforward and honest. Also I had minimal hair loss as well

I had extensive hair loss and thinning with FacialTeam and the results of the simultaneous hair transplant were terrible. Completely unnatural hairline with 90 degree corners. After the shock loss a lot of my hair regrew, but I was left with a bald spot above the incision (not even where the stitches were) and with all over thinning of my hair. My guess is that they damaged the blood supply. I am working with doctors that actually know what they are doing to revise my hairline and face now and I wish I had done more consultations before going with FT because they are a bunch of local doctors pretending to be world class.
</p>
<p>
I would never go with them again. They have no postop care and repeatedly told me that they do not have the skills required to fix the mistakes that they made. During the consultation they tell you they will do everything, that you will have no issues, that these things never happen. And when all of them happen to you they ignore you and ghost you.
</p>
<p>
If you request your patient record you will discover that they don&#39;t even take any notes or document what they do, which greatly complicates revisions with other doctors since they use non standard techniques and don&#39;t keep records of how they performed the procedures.
</p>
<p>
Good choice to go somewhere else.
