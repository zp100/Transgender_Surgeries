Hi, using a throwaway here. I&#39;m a Chettawut patient, had GRS 7 weeks ago. Unfortunately I had two complications: an UTI which I think started when I still had the packing/catheter on as I felt burning in the urethra when I went to pass stools, and I kept going to pee when they removed the catheter so they gave me a high dose of antibiotics and it went away quickly. The other complication was some necrosis on the exterior of the clitoral hood, the nurses said they noticed when the packing was first removed but they only told me a couple weeks in (when I asked if everything was fine) because they said sometimes it goes away on its own. Hence I had a revision labiaplasty on the final consultation day, I was re-catheterised and they put the whole packing back for a day (luckily, as my urethra wasn&#39;t too happy about that second catheter). I was also told I&#39;m somewhat of a slow healer (not sure why, I never drink or smoke, but I don&#39;t do exercise much if at all if that counts).
</p>
<p>
Here are pictures, of the original design (I only took one, sadly), of what it looked like just after revision, and right now. Does it look fine for 7 weeks? I&#39;ve seen a lot of result pictures but mine seem unlike any of them (for reference, I wasn&#39;t circumcised but I had been 6 years on HRT so maybe there wasn&#39;t much to work with; Chett didn&#39;t mention anything about lacking tissue on the first consultation though).

The ones within the canal seem to have dissolved, the ones within the labia minora/clitoral hood are still there for the most part (some of them moved/fell) but I think he put those during the revision (so they&#39;ve just been there for 4 weeks).

Hmm...from what I&#39;ve seen around here it looks pretty swollen still, but that&#39;s normal for seven weeks.

Looks like it, I hope it&#39;ll look more like the other results later on as it&#39;s different from all the other early recovery pics I&#39;ve seen
