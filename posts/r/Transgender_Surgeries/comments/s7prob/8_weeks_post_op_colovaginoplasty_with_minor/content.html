How long was the wait list?
</li>
<li>
How was the pain?
</li>
<li>
What depth did you get?

EUR 25,000.
</p>
<p>
22CM depth.  I can probably get a bit more, but 22 is very comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Pain has been okay, but healing takes time.  The dehisence (the small split you can see on left, where a suture ripped preventing a clean closure during healing) has been a bit of a blow setting things back a few weeks.  It is self correcting if kept clean and is a common minor complication from what I have read.
</p>
<p>
At 8 weeks I have some tenderness.  In the clinic pain was not a big problem, drugs worked well.
</p>
<p>
I booked a date about a month after speaking to them.  Wasn&#39;t a problem.
</p>
<p>
Also, Spain has no paper walls.  If the surgeon agrees to proceed, no other restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Love the result, great sensitivity, great interior, very good and natural in all aspects.
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t wait for healing to complete.  Dilating has not been uncomfortable since the second week.
</p>
<p>
If you speak to them, mention Kim signposted you there and ask for Aida and you&#39;ll be well looked after.

Did you have insurance? I would like to go to Dr. Manero too but for me that amount is very important. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking how the other girls did it, if they had a mortgage or other solution.

I believe this is in Catalonia specifically, some regions in Spain do require letters to be approved for surgery

Yes, I can confirm it is a regional law here in Catalonia, were you don&#39;t need any psychological documentation, if you have the money you can book surgeries pretty quickly. In some places they ask you some evidence that you&#39;re on HRT, but that&#39;s really it.
</p>
<p>
But in contrast, almost no surgery is covered by the public health system, only the vaginoplasty if you&#39;re willing to wait +5 years (edit: sorry, also phalloplasty and mastectomy for trans men), and private insurances don&#39;t cover any gender related procedure.

Can you suggest any orchiectomy surgeons? There&#39;s been quite a few people looking for informed consent surgeons in Europe.

I only know the one who did my orchiectomy in Barcelona, Jorge Saenz de Cabezón (I did a post about it in this sub some time ago) who also does vaginoplasties and has quite a bit of reputation (I think he was one on the first surgeons who started to perform gender affirming surgeries for trans women here in Spain). I only had to wait like 3 weeks between the first visit and the surgery.

I found it, but didn&#39;t add it to the wiki before as you didn&#39;t mention of the surgeon at the time, or that it was informed consent. I&#39;ll add it now.
</p>
<p>
I found a few links, but not quite sure I&#39;m not quite sure who its is or where he works?

1 week in clinic.  Then they say 2 weeks nearby.  I stayed for 3 and had a minor repair done in that 3rd week.  I also arrived a week earlier so I could stick to the terrible low residue diet before the surgery and also to get a little familiar with the area.
</p>
<p>
Around Eur 100 per day is a rough guide.
</p>
<p>
So, I was in Spain for 5 weeks in total.  3 weeks is possible, but living in Taiwan I gave myself plenty of time.

Why did you choose Manero? I’d have thought Thailand would be the usual option for Taiwan and there’s very little info on Manero.

Dr. Manero has done 2500 vaginoplasties and has a reputation in the industry for repairing the work of other surgeons.  He is actually a legend in the inner circle of surgeons.  Thailand just felt a little too much like a ladyboy factory production line to me and Ivan Manero is amazing.  Honestly, the FFS and SRS results I got are beyond amazing.  So happy.  His team did both for me in one day and I felt very well cared for throughout.

Did you see any post op results before going to him?
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure how you can say he’s a legend as I’ve tried to find into on him before and there’s very little. This is all I could find.

You’ve made a big contribution in what’s available. If you know of any more could you please link it so I can add it.
</p>
<p>
Did you get srs and ffs at the same time? I assumed that price was just for srs?

Combined SRS and FFS was 35k EUR.  I got some discount on the FFS for doing both at the same time.
</p>
<p>
I actually phoned around various people in the industry and asked about various surgeons I had heard of.  So, it was word of mouth.
</p>
<p>
I actually asked people who they would recommend to try and repair a very poorly done vaginoplasty.  His name came up several times.
</p>
<p>
Inside Spain he is a celebrity and was performing these surgeries even when Franco was in power and LGBT were being heavily persecuted.  He was so kind to me when I met him and he had such gentle confidence and a caring attitude, I just felt safe.
</p>
<p>
I did see some results and they looked good.

Thank you.  Yes, I&#39;ll be glad when the healing is complete, but love the result.  My girlfriend was exploring again last night, we are both fascinated by how detailed and natural it is, not to mention the incredible sensations it can produce.  Glad you are happy with your outcome too.

Dr Manero has a reputation for repairs.  I found his team to be amazing and so happy with my own outcome.  Highly recommended.  Have a chat with them over video.  Aida can arrange it for you.  Mention me to her:  Kim

<p>
Sorry to hear about all your problems.
</p>
<p>
Good luck

How is sex after surgery? Is it painful? Can you have rough sex or is it too delicate?

Sex is great, if you’re lucky enough to meet a male lover capable of making love with some skill.  Lots of sensation, good climaxes, etc.  I dilate still once a week with the orange dilator, I had a Dutch lover with a very large penis, it was challenging, and painful at first, but great.  Sore for a few days after, but in a very pleasing way.

I am still 4 weeks away from being healed enough to have sex.  Also, my partner is female.  I will definitely want to try, but...  Not sure with who, not sure when.  Also, I think I would like to dilate up a bit more first to minimize any discomfort.  She knows I want to, and is actually asking around her male friends...  I find it funny, and told her if she is offering me around, at least ask for some money.  Lol.
