Can it be felt or anything? Is it medically a problem?
</p>
<p>
Obviously you would rather not have it, but is it really the end of the world?

The follicle and the potential for ingrown hairs can become ongoing points of infection.

Its frustrating. Def can be felt and gets a bit irritating sometimes during sex. But it&#39;s an easy fix and further electrolysis isnt too bad.

I’m not sure I’ve heard of anyone who has managed to remove deep hair.

I had it removed under general anesthesia. My hairs were extremely deep and otherwise inaccessible. I was also having other issues fixed at that time, so I asked the surgeon to address that issue while she was in there anyway. To quote my gyno:
</p>
<p>
&#34;She underwent surgery at that time, and several hairs were removed from the vaginal epithelium along the posterior vaginal area. The follicles were gently cauterized in attempt to decrease likelihood of hair regrowth.&#34;

Just about 9 weeks ago. I&#39;m not yet entirely confident that it was all removed. It&#39;s just too soon. At an examination 2 days ago, my surgeons didn&#39;t see any hair though. :)

I’m having a revision at 8 months post SRS and my surgeon will perform this. Do you know if dilation is painful (or even risky) right after the procedure? Like that needle is actually burning the skin isn’t it?

I do not know, but I dont think so as long as the lube used is that antibacterial stuff we use for catheters and the dialatiors are properly cleaned. Painful, possibly, but not directly harmful

It fucking sucks to have internal vaginal hair. I finally had it removed 5 years after my first surgery with Rumer. I used to feel the hair scraping against the very back or top of my vagina. It was physically uncomfortable and psychologically infuriating. I needed 3 major revision surgeries after Rumer. I had the hairs removed in my second most recent surgery. Learn from my experience and get your hair removed first. In my personal experience, if surgeon says that hair removal is not needed with their technique and that there&#39;s no regrowth, IT&#39;S NOT TRUE.

It&#39;s horrible frustrating. Discovered a bunch of hair at the 5th month. 3 or 4  (of 4, 5 cms long) hairs,  are coming out and show up out in the entrance. More deep, i can touch a bunch of them like forming some crusts. Started to bleed in every Dilation session after that. Im using pessaries or ovules. No gynecologist wanted to use speculum to see inside. Went to 4 or 5 in 6 months.
</p>
<p>
Dr Javier Belinky said &#34;this is weird, almost impossible to happen. Put some epilation creme. Or wait some more, let&#39;s see if they go away alone&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Absolutely horrible person I Do not recommend Belinky in any way. An epilation creme who dissolve hairs INSIDE MY BODY?? And &#34;let&#39;s see if they go away&#34;???
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m actually devastated for another nerve damage issue that may be a complication of this, as my spine has nothing bad. Saddle anesthesia. I can&#39;t feel the whole vulva, just some spots. I had complete sensitivity till this happened and lost it in few hours after a sharp pain in clitoral urhetra region. Next day I couldn&#39;t feel my labias, canal, perineum and some users told me about cauda equina syndrome. Did 2 MRI and it wasn&#39;t CES.  But it could be a tumor or an infection causing nerve damage in the pelvic zone, and I think what if?  Could the hairs having something to do with this nerve numbness? I was feeling 100% healed, then this happens and devastated me, and Belinky did another of his gaslighting maneuvering avoiding a true response with help.

I’m not a medical expert, but I’ve read a few research papers on neovaginal hair growth. I’d look at getting your vaginal pH measured. Vaginas are supposed to be somewhat acidic in order to be healthy. If your pH is 4.0 - 4.5, hair shouldn’t be able to grow. If it’s higher than 4.5, then you should look at ways to improve your vaginal microbiome.

So I went back and tried to find my source on acidity inhibiting hair growth, but I can’t dig up anything. It’s likely that was mistaken about that, in which case I apologize. I definitely did not intend to mislead anyone.
</p>
<p>
One thing that is pretty clear: an acidic vagina helps prevent unhealthy bacteria and yeast infections from multiplying. That’s what boric acid vaginal suppositories are used for. But I couldn’t find any evidence that vaginal acidity prevents internal hair growth.

That sounds great as in my country no one will do electrolysis or any other treatment due to discriimnation and rejection of medical community.
