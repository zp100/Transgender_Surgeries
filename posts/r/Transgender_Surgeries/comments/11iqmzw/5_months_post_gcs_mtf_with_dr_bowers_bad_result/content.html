I’ve been with a cis girl with almost no labia minora that also fused above the vaginal opening. Everyone’s vulvas are different and it doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you! That being said if a revision would make you happier please do so. Your comfort is the most important

Hey, I wanna add that, compared to what I had before, I&#39;m really happy with my genitals, and I know things might look slightly better after the last stretch of the healing process. Sometimes I worry that my results aren&#39;t great -- I feel weird abt how small my inner lips are, how they end/fuse together above my vaginal opening instead of below it, and how I don&#39;t really have a clitoral hood. It isn&#39;t that surprising there&#39;s less going on down there, since I was kinda small going into surgery and was also circumcised. I feel like I lack the right perspective to evaluate what I have, especially since my relief at not having a dick and my general body insecurities both skew my judgement. Should I be trying to somehow save up for a revision down the road? Is it mostly in my head? How do y&#39;all feel abt these results, and are they normal for us?

There are cisgender women getting their labia trimmed, and they look a lot like yours. I wouldn&#39;t panic. Looks great, btw.

for what it&#39;s worth, both of these -
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
are considered limitations of most currently performing american surgeons. and aesthetic revision to fix both is more than possible. Avanaessian even mentioned being able to charge insurance for the revision.

Don&#39;t answer if you feel uncomfortable but I&#39;d appreciate if someone answered.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re are small like an inch soft but when your hard you go to 7 inches while you are in surgery do they give you a boner to have more to work with?

You&#39;re good, ha. With the surgery, they&#39;re recycling the skin and throwing away most of the erectile tissue. If your skin stretches from 1&#34; to 7&#34; now, I guess it should do the same when they&#39;re  lining your canal and sculpting the lips, and getting hard wouldn&#39;t give you more skin.

Honestly, if it helps, I&#39;m AFAB myself and I would&#39;ve just assumed it was cis. Vulvas are extremely diverse things, just like their owners!
<br>
If this helps, here are some art projects celebrating just that:

Your scarring is moderately worse than I usually see from Bowers along with the asymmetry. She’s known for not giving inner labia and it looks like your clit is buried. The scars will fade and medical tattooing can help but I’m concerned about how tight looking the scar tissue looks by the opening to the vagina. It’s not the best result I’ve seen but you’re far from being a botched case.

I am transmasc so I don&#39;t have any experience telling you if your surgery was done well/poorly, but I do have experience with surgical scarring and I would recommend you ask your doctor if there are any lotions or creams you can use to soften the scars and allow the skin to be more elastic.  I know that for external use there are, but I am hesitant to make any recommendations because I don&#39;t know what specific considerations need to be made in this case.

Function is great. Dilation is a bitch and I hate it, but that&#39;s just how it is when everything&#39;s still healing. It gets wayyy easier after the first few weeks, which were almost torture, ha.

It looks really tidy and clean from the front which is a great result! However, you are right that there is a lack of lips but it’s definitely not a bad result but doesn’t necessarily look cis but then do they ever look cis? A revision would be totally up to you! How is your sensation?

Thanks so much, I do really appreciate that. Personally I really wish it was less &#34;nice and tidy&#34; though, ha. Having what some people call a &#34;porn pussy&#34; is definitely not /my/ ideal.

No reason to feel weird! Cis women have those types of vaginas too. Don&#39;t let shitty porn culture affect you feelings about it. It&#39;s toxic stuff.
</p>
<p>
That being said, if you prefer a different look go ahead and get a revision. Surgery is expensive and you&#39;ll have that vaginas for life so you deserve a vaginas that makes you feel good.
</p>
<p>
But personally, I think it looks perfectly normal.

Sensation is great. If I did eventually get a revision do you know if I could get bigger lips? Or is that more out of the surgeon&#39;s control? I definitely think I would want a revision, but I don&#39;t know when I&#39;d be able to afford it. The initial bottom surgery was fully covered by insurance, and it still took me forever to save up enough for the copay and time off work. I haven&#39;t asked Dr. Bower&#39;s abt it, but I&#39;ve heard she&#39;s hesitant to perform revisions on her own work (that might not be true though). I am really grateful for what she&#39;s done.

This is probably the one area where I’d wait to get outside negative reviews before doing anything about it. Since cost and recovery time is a factor for you, just… see how it “performs in the wild” before making any judgments. I think you’re being extra critical of yourself, with what is clearly a good result.

what is the problem to do lipofilling and correction? everything looks fine for your first operation, labioplasty is needed in 99% of cases. So heal to the end and go ahead for correction.

The only problem is that I won&#39;t have the money for a labiaplasty anytime soon.

Your vaginal opening looks like mine I think, and I feel like that’s something others have complimented me on. I’ve seen girls have revisions to close the opening because there’s too much space at the opening. I posed pictures of what mine look like on my profile.

Cis vaginas come in all different shapes and sizes. Therefore the concerns you are voicing shouldn&#39;t matter to a partner with any type of knowledge on Cis kitty.

I don&#39;t think that bad result and all different shapes sizes of vagina and you have not recovered that soon. We are our own worst critics nothing I do is ever good enough it seems. 🤗❤️

There are women who look kike that and some men prefer women who look like that.  Your comfort is most important, though.  You may, however, grow to love it.

If you aren&#39;t satisfied with the looks you can get vagiplasty or something along those lines
