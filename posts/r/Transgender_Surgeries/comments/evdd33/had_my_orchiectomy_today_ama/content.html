I actually cried a little, I&#39;ll be getting my surgery in two month and while I transitioned 4 years ago. Now understand that doing an orchiectomy would have helped me so much during these times. This is the kind of story I enjoy reading !

Aww well, your not alone. I start crying thinking about how right I think I feel!  I am still swollen down there but when I go potty, its a relief not feeling them anymore!  I tear up instanntly - what was so alien feeling to me my whole life is now partially gone and its the most incredible relief!  I will be having GRS this year for sure now, especially since I just met my deductible!

Was it an Inguinal Orchiectomy or Scrotal you had?

Scrotal - i wanted the inguinal but Dr insisted on scrotal - less co.opications and easier recovery.
</p>
<p>
I recommend doing the orchy first for some better pain management of the bottom surgery. The orchy itself is painful enough, it would be good not to feel the lain I have now plsu the pain GRS brings.
</p>
<p>
Since I came to yesterday after the orchy, I&#39;ve had a constant getting kicked in the nuts fwwling rhat doesnt let up much.  The scrotum and incision itself dont hurt allt all, but my lower adbomen -OMG!  Its worth it though, and I would absolutely do it again without hesitation based on the happy two hour long waterfall session!

Congratulations! I had mine exactly 3 months ago! I also felt nauseous and shaky after waking up. But it passed. I managed pain with acetominophin (SP?) And ibuprofin (SP?).
</p>
<p>
Take it easy for about 10 days! I took two weeks off, but I think it was maybe overkill. Also, you won&#39;t feel like it, but try to walk a bit after a couple days and increase activity slowly.
</p>
<p>
I got freaked out touching the area, but that subsided after a couple days.
</p>
<p>
I developed a little bit of swelling that was kind of firm on the right side. It felt like it was a cystic thing the size of half a walnut. I was worried about it and it was kind of painful, but it subsided significantly.
</p>
<p>
Wear bicycle/yoga shorts and ice for 10minutes every hour!!
</p>
<p>
Good luck on your recovery!!

Thank you for sharing!  I actually started walking about the house as soon as I got home, originally thinking Id go straight to bed. No issue there!
</p>
<p>
My nauseau was controlled with an anti nausea shot, and two bags of saline in my IV.
</p>
<p>
Pain is handled by some narcotic now that seems very dangerous to take - they give you a powder to destroy the leftovers in water when you reach pain mgmgt without them.
</p>
<p>
So far I&#39;m wearing my bikini panties and my wife gave me the biggest pad she has, which is huge...i replaced the gauze with that and it gives enough pressure in the right areas with my panties to be comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Now, if I could only go #2!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a little hesitant to feel around - its swelling enough to look like they are still there :(
</p>
<p>
How long fid the walnut sized swelling take to dissipate?  I&#39;ve been very worried about the end of the chords enlarging, I&#39;ve read about two folks that happened to and they got stuck in the canals making it painful!  Afraid it will bring back fysphoria in a bad way if that happens...

Dear, if your Dr. sectioned the cords as high as he could, you‚Äôve nothing to worry about. They most likely retreated up into the canals and you are done with them. The important thing is to avoid any straining/heavy lifting and the like while healing as that can make the ends swell. My Doc prescribed a stool softener and it helped. I share your feelings of relief. For me, it was so confirming to have the bastards gone and finally pain free‚ù£Ô∏è Huggs‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è

Ok fantastic!  This is what I am hopeful for.  Yeah, I&#39;ll be working from home starting friday or mo day for about two weeks. I work in IT as a director but I still do everything in IT as I used to - so physical labor is required. My backpack is lime 20lbs, so my weight restriction for 3 weeks prevents me from going to work....  plus my hour long commute will pro ly kill me!

Wearing compression shorts, ice, and using ibuprofen and acetominophin will reduce swelling.
</p>
<p>
I noticed the swelling about two weeks in. It didn&#39;t go down to the size it is now (like a little peanut) for maybe a month or so. I think it happened by me straining to get a blanket off. Not sure. But it&#39;s settled to being almost completely gone, and it&#39;s certainly not intrusive.

I felt similar coming off of being anesthetized for wisdom teeth. The nurse showed up with a wheelchair and I&#39;m thinking &#34;that&#39;s crazy! I don&#39;t need that!&#34;
</p>
<p>
So then I tried to get up and realized &#34;oh! I can&#39;t even standup, much less walk.&#34; I felt nauseous when I got upright too but didn&#39;t hurl.

Wow - that stuff is crazy!  I remember clear as day how it made me feel - it was the worst part of surgery!  I stood up after urinating and I thought I was gonna die!  Nurse said i turned whiter than the toilet....  my lips matched as well. She went to action fast and made all the difference.

I never could tuck before - the orchialgia made it too painful to stomach. It literally felt like a constant kick in that area - much like it does now since theyve been cut out. But once it subsides (its 50% better since yesterday) i should never hopefully have that feeling again!  Also, not sure about tucking - if it will work for me or not. I&#39;m afraid it will make me feel it down there and that will make me dysphoric. For me, both penis and testicles have never felt as an actual part of me - more so a thing that was there with no real feeling. When I dont notice them there from them moving or whatever, I couldnt feel that they actually existed unless my leg touched something or if they got squashed somehow - not that it hurt, but whatever part of my body they touched would notice them. With the orchialgia I was aware of my testicles 100% of the time and it became maddening!

Wow! Congrats on your journey. Hope you continue to heal as you become happy, healthy &amp; affirmed. I‚Äôm a trans girl (age 23) &amp; I‚Äôm having my orchiectomy surgery in 5 days. It‚Äôs my first trans surgery ever. I‚Äôve been on HRT for over 1.5yrs. I‚Äôm non op GRS/SRS by choice. So the journey will end with an orchi for me. Besides maybe one or two very minor FFS procedures. So is the pain manageable with pain pills like Tylenol &amp; ice packs? I know to wear tight underwear which i do anyway. My only two concerns are showering &amp; going pee. How soon are you able to shower? &amp; does it hurt to pee at all? &amp; lastly I‚Äôm a side sleeper at night...will I have to sleep on my back or no? Thanks for your timeüòä

Yes the pain is manageable that way. It is a little intense feom time to time but if you get comfy and dont move then your fine. I showered this morning, 24 hours after surgery. Peeing is fine - but they warn you not to push and strain yourself. Let it just trickle out. After a while it gets even easier, not that it was hard at all in the first place. Now - going #2 I still havent figured out and its driving me nuts.  No pun intended there either!
</p>
<p>
I am a side sleeper too, but I think with something like this its more natural to just lay on your back. I slept on my back for what little I actually slept last night and that was fine - normally I hate sleeping that way though.
</p>
<p>
All in all - even with the pain I currently have which really isnt that bad unless I go to stand or sit. Once I&#39;m fully up or down everything is good. I&#39;d do it again in a heartbeat if I had to. I already feel better!  I took my E injection just now too - something ive been craving as I had to stop for a while for surgery so i expect to feel even better by this evening!

Thank you so much for your insightful reply.  I figured pain is there but manageable. Ha! Omg you got me good with the ‚Äúdriving me nuts‚Äù no pun intended commentü§£ &amp; guess I‚Äôll have to adapt to sleeping on my back for the first time since I was an infant lol. This will be tricky. I can‚Äôt wait to go off t blockers for life &amp; have improved health, happiness, &amp; better/faster/permanent feminization. My t levels are low but sadly so is my e levels. Apparently the orchiectomy accelerates the feminizing effects of estrogen raising e levels a lot? Cause you don‚Äôt just block t but you cut off the source. Big difference! Hoping that‚Äôs the case for me.

For me - when I started E in May of 2019 my T was 36 naturally. It was 7 in November. Per my urologist thatvis less than a castrated person!  No clue really as to why nor do I care. My testes were painful for the last couple years and there was three options- live with it - denerve the apermatic chord - orchy.  I chose the orchy as Im gonna have bottom surgery later this year anyhow.
</p>
<p>
But amazingly enough, without the T already, I think they maybe were inhiniting something?  I had misses my E shot for a while, and o ly having the Orchy 32 hours ago, my wife said this afternoon my breasts were visibly larger!  I thought so too but didnt say anything because I&#39;m always hoping they get larger....  not sure why this is though?  I only took my E shot an hour ago so no way it could have been that.
</p>

Laying on your back after &#34;trauma&#34; like an orchy will I think come naturally. Like me, I ALWAYS sleep on my side. When I got in bed last night, it was very natural feeling to just lay on my back with no thought about it, kinda surprised me when it didnt feel uncomfortable. You wont think anything of it.

Day two!  Feeling wonderful overall - took my Estrogen shot last night and finally slept a solid 8 hours all the way through. Swelling is still bad, especially right below my abdomen (above the penis).  I&#39;m guessing that is normal though. My mind is finally clearing up again as well!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m freezing as usual so my wife got a fire going for me in the fireplace to help take off the chill :)
</p>
<p>
Oh- i finally got a #2 in last night, although limited, again this morning, also very little, and yet again since!  Maybe things are statting to flow there too - I have a feeling that not going #2 is a decent amount of the pain I still feel.
</p>
<p>
I love how I feel now and I&#39;m happy this is progressing :)  looking forward to my future for once!

So today, two days after my orchy, I was able to work from home for about 6 hours but wow does things hurt! It took  a LOT out of me and I ended up crashing around 330 (napped till about 7).
</p>
<p>
The incision is fine, no pain or even notice that its there.  The lower abdomen pain from the getting kicked in the what was there is minimal now, maybe even gone.
</p>
<p>
The worst pain now is right above the penis, where pubic hair is. Its so swollen there there that any leg movement at all causes it to really hurt.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve backed down on the narcotics(pain meds) by 1/4 (was 2 every 6 hours, now trying 1 every 12 hours) just to be able to think clearly so I can try and work.  Might be why the pain is more now than before?
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, the emotional aspect of the orchy.....I feel a massive amount of difference, relief, happiness, and have a new sense of where I am going and what I have to do. When I look in the mirror now, something I&#39;ve always despised, I see something different. Something maybe possibly good, something I may finally be able to live with one day. I dont know what it is that I see but damnit something is there and I&#39;m determined to find it.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow will be rough since my department is very short and I&#39;m going ro have to cover one of my senior staffs absent for a part of the day.  But no matter. Life is finally going to be good and that will get me through whatever tomorrow brings ü•∞

Thanks for sharing. This is great info. I really want to get this myself; however, I am concerned that it would have negative affects on GCS. Can you share any information you might have learned in regards to the affect on GCS after an orchi. Does it have any negative effects on depth, etc?

From everything I&#39;ve read, been told and heard, there will be no negative effects or issues with depth. Now, I cant be 100% sure this is the case but ai have no reason to doubt it.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pain I have had from the orchy, I HIGHLY advise doing the orchy first!  I think getting past this pain now, will lessen a lot of the pain you will have with bottom surgery. Although I cant also be sure of that but I&#39;d be willing to bet it will help. Plus, the psychological benefit of having the shackles removed, and IF you have to have anti androgens now, you can most likely stop those which I understand is a huge positive thing?  I was fortunate enough to not have any T - probly part of why I had Orchialgia, which was the primary cause for the orchiectomy.  It also just happened to be a procedure I was very happy to have so that helped me get approval to have it done sooner (hadnt been on hormones a year yet, and hadnt talked to a therapist long enough either)

Do you have a cost for this yet? I was just quoted an insanely high number for him... I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s a mistake as my surgery would be in 2 weeks....

I just got it for 40,000 this seems ridiculous for this same procedure.... I&#39;m waiting to talk to the payment plan people to see the exact cost and I&#39;m kinda freaking out...
