I just had minimal depth SRS and FFS together with Dr. Chettawut last week. I&#39;m very happy to have minimal depth SRS without the need for dilation. I think I would regret if I had a full depth vaginoplasty that requires dilation as that means too much time commitment and more associated risks and troubles for me. But even after the surgery, I&#39;m still confused about transgender sexuality in general. I&#39;ve read many posts here on Reddit and articles from other soruces on full depth vaginoplasty and minimal depth SRS. Before researching into this topic, I am not familiar with the anatomical structure and even just naturally assumed all SRSs are without the construction of a vaginal canal. That was probably because I have had no sexual relationship with other people and have never watched any porns depicting penetrative sex. I&#39;m not interested in that at all and I just don&#39;t have any spontaneous desire for that. I&#39;m just totally fine with masturbation only and had no sex experience with anyone. When I read many articles and posts on dilation and its possible difficulties and issues and risks, I just don&#39;t understand why other people will invest so much time on dilation and is willing to take additional risks (including being ended up with no depth in spite of diligent dilation) and why they are so sure they desire penetrative sex even before they had the surgery. This just makes me think that I&#39;m the weird type of transgender girl and I&#39;m very different from others. I&#39;m so confused about transgender sexuality in general.
</p>
<p>
I think the main reason is I&#39;m asexual and don&#39;t have the desire to have sex with other people at all. I have never watched a porn depicting penetrative sex and I&#39;m not interested in it or think it is a necessity in life. Given that, the purpose for having a full depth canal is moot and the efforts for dilation serves no purpose. I think I&#39;m just the super minority of ace transgender and I don&#39;t expect to find another ace partner at all and I&#39;m fine to be single. I think having a canal is more about pleasing a non-ace partner. I&#39;m 34 this year but I have had no experience in romantic relationship or sexual relationship with other people at all. It seems that friendship is more important to me than finding a partner. I&#39;d like to make more firends but don&#39;t think finding a partner is a necessity. That being said, even if I want to get married, it is extremely difficult to get a reliable partner who can accept a transgender spouse in the country where I live. I&#39;m not obsessed with the idea of having the exact anatomy as a cis because it is not always technologically possible. Let alone even there is a canal, there is no womb and ovary. Maybe if there is a method of adding a canal that does not require dilation and does not cause scarring problem or lose depth (I personally have scarring problems for any kind surgeries that involve skin incisions and internal scars will be problematic for me), I may try such option, but it is nonexistent right now. If in the transgender community, people will have a weird feeling towards people like me who are not interested in having a canal because they don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary, I will be very sad about this.

Personally I want to be as close to a cis woman anatomically as possible and I enjoy penetration even if it doesn&#39;t give me much sexual pleasure, it&#39;s really nice getting the kind of connection you get from sex.

I think it&#39;s just good to keep in mind that the trans population is just as diverse as the cis population. at least in my personal trans environments, there&#39;s all sorts of genital situations and desires for change and they vary quite widely. what I&#39;ve learnt tho, is that there&#39;s always somebody sharing those feelings.
</p>
<p>
as an example, most other transfems i know in rl, do not desire bottom surgery at all &amp; for the longest time I did feel weird about that - spending a lot of time on this subreddit on the other hand, sometimes makes it feel like every single transfem ever wants a cis-looking full-depth srs
</p>
<p>
not exactly sure about my point here, all i&#39;m saying is, no matter how you feel about your own sexuality, there&#39;s probably some people out there who feel similarly about it and in the end, i think this community is not united by wanting the same procedures, but by wanting any sort of affirming procedures in the first place, no matter what these might look like or whether one would personally get them too - i think that&#39;s quite beautiful

Interesting. It is surely a matter for each individual to decide. If you are happy for zero depth, then do it.  The danger I can see from reading some of the comments so far, and no doubt I will be shouted down for this, is that we should not just expect to have the full works and nothing else. If that is the stance there is a danger of labelling someone different and then you get social problems with discrimination etc.
</p>
<p>
If you are gay you get labelled homosexual or lesbian, but you are still a male or a female. If you have vaginaplasty or vulvoplasty alone, you are still a transwoman so let&#39;s not try and evolve yet another label.
</p>
<p>
Stick with your choice. It sounds to me you have done your research well, you know how your body will react to surgery, ie scarring, and know what you want in terms of a relationship in the future.
</p>
<p>
I am transitioning later in life at the age of 69. When I was younger and first considered the grs I wanted the full works. However, at the age I am now, I have decided for zero depth option. Medically it makes sense as far as risks are concerned and my partner is happy with my decision.
</p>
<p>
What I am trying to say here is that if you change your mind, you can have a canal later in life if you wish. As medical procedures improve, it may become easier and be less difficult.
</p>
<p>
You are yourself. Be yourself and go with your decision. You are no less a person, no less a transwoman / female than others who have a canal.
</p>
<p>
One last thought. Not all cis women have a vagina or a cervix. What does that make them? Are they not female?

I agree with you. If I could carry a baby, I would want a vagina too. But the dimple has no function. I too am having a zero depth bottom surgery next week.

Becoming fully aligned—for some—is important. It’s rather better to have full vaginoplasty, in case later on your mind shifts to having penetrative sex, non-anal.
</p>
<p>
By taking zero-depth, you’ve locked in having no penetrative sex. Ever. Just anal.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy to report my decision to go with Dr. Min Jun, Peritoneal Flap vaginoplasty. It’s a very different and beautiful experience to use his godly talents. And much prefer PIV sex, than anal. It feels much better, less needing to prep or douche (who likes shit all over the place or the fear of?), etc. It’s still fun though.
</p>
<p>
Again, for some, the mind-body connection is real. And why dysphoria is real. Some don’t need GCS. And that’s fine. However, I could not understand going from an original dysphoric state…into genitals which “appear” female, but cannot have penetration as such. To me, IMO, it feels going from a dysphoric state into a “chastity belt” state.
</p>
<p>
I feel, and it’s my personal opinion alone, that any transition journey is challenging, mentally, physically, or otherwise. I don’t believe it’s one that ever involves cutting corners or being done half-invested. Half-*ssed. Again, my opinion…which may not be right for you.
</p>
<p>
It’s better to try…and maybe fail. Rather than lock in a perceived limitation. In accordance with your surgeon though. If he said it was healthier for you to be zero-depth, celebrate &amp; be grateful for that.

It might be possible to get PPT later if you decide you want depth.
