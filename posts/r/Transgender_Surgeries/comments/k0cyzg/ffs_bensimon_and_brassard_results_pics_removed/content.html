This is... Incredibly alarming for me. I&#39;m booked with Bensimon because he&#39;s supposed to be &#34;safe&#34; and conservative with his work. If that&#39;s not true I don&#39;t really see a point in paying the premium

Some girls are satisfied with him. Not saying it’s all bad.
</p>
<p>
The point why I want my reviews to be posted and stop surgeons to be allowed to go uncheck and delete reviews. Is that.
</p>
<p>
My ffs was done in 3 hours. Got multiple issues. It’s mentioned in my other post. So won’t go in details again here.
</p>
<p>
I did a YouTube video once and I know when it was up. Girls seemed to be ok. Well reviews from him and comments I heard that he was taking 6-7-8 hours.  Which is like a standard for FFS is you do like forehead, chin nose and other stuff.if you just do one thing than for sure it’s less.
</p>
<p>
I got threats for sharing my experience from their legal team.Took it down. And got shit last week from one my friend because her friend chose him . He pulled a fast one again it seems ( her words) not mine. And it doesn’t looks good.
</p>
<p>
So if no one speaks out about it well it seems, it’s coming back.
</p>
<p>
Comes back to my point. Maybe he’s good. And maybe he’ll a great job now that he knows I am going ballistic about posting everywhere at the cost of my career and pretty much my life.  :)

Jesus, my surgery is supposed to be all day. From what you&#39;re saying it sounds exactly like the type of surgery they&#39;d rush. I&#39;m going to have to do some thinking. Thank you.

Well he has not rush everyone. You did mention you wanted someone conservative and he is conservative.
</p>

Sorry I’ve put you in that position. I know it’s a big decision. And I know how much it’s an exciting one.

I know but we go through so much already. Like people don’t know me here. And from my little friend experience on social media. It doesn’t take a lot for people to categorize other into a negative vibe role. Which is so not my intention. Like I almost took my life and I consider myself a really strong cookie. I just know the impact it can have now.
</p>
<p>
I truly wish u the best whatever choice U make :)

Yeah they do that. My review on butcher Bart Van de Ven was also removed. They are often bribed by surgeons.

Yeah, it’s really sad.  The best one is that when you seek legal assistance in Quebec.  In this case I’m talking about my face. You need an expertise. And well I’m mean this place is huge  im terms of heaviness. And Bensimon not sure if he still is. Was the at one the president of cosmetic surgeons of Quebec and Vp of Canada.
</p>
<p>
So we ( me and my legal advisor) paid an expert. Which is already hard to find because no one else does FFS I’m Quebec. And you need someone that practice law in the province of Quebec. Accepted the money and the contract to examine me and to do a report and come testify if there is fault.
</p>
<p>
I met with him.  He tried to convince me for 30 min to drop the charges. When I said I wasn’t going to do it.  Told me that before I should have talked to Brassard before starting a legal process against Bensimon.
</p>
<p>
I told him to exam me and do his report.  A week later he had sent back the money and told my lawyer he didn’t had enough time to properly evaluate me so he couldn’t a report.
</p>
<p>
This is the reality of what’s happening. I told my lawyer what happens if I don’t all expert I crooked like that? She said well you can’t do anything. And this is what is happening.  Physician and specialist have confirmed my issues and problems but they are not deemed expert in a legal context and therefore cannot be  used.
</p>
<p>
They have a little monopoly and do whatever they want. And if things go wrong. There is nothing I can do about it. And on top you can’t even warn others with reviews.
</p>
<p>
So yeah.  I am not going away ;)

Realself is probably owned by providers just like those credit “help” agencies are owned by creditors.

Fuck in so sorry for this happening to you.. I did read a review on real self about a botched srs and he said “well it’s better than what you had before”
</p>
<p>
If that was yours I’m so sorry you’re going through this.
</p>
<p>
I’m suppose to get a BA from either brassard or billenger next year.. cause it’s covered by insurance. But now I’m not so sure

Omg no that’s not me and no don’t me Brassard responded that? Must have been a comment from someone. I don’t think a surgeon would actually exposed themselves to such a level publicly disrespecting someone. Poor her.
