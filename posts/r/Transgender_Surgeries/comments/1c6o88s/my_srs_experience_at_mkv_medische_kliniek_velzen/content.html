This is a long post, I included all major events from my stay that I think are important. My final thoughts are at the bottom as a TL;DR.
</p>
<h1>
INTAKE
</h1>
<p>
Last year I had some issues with getting SRS at VUmc and the waitlist with them was just too long for me so I decided to look elsewhere for my SRS. I&#39;d heard of Dr. Kanhai and how he&#39;d be able to create a vagina that has the functionality of becoming wet upon arousal and that has extra sensitivity. The reason I didn&#39;t go for him in the first place is because I had already been on the waitlist with VUmc for years, so I just thought I&#39;d wait for them.
</p>
<p>
I expressed interest towards my psychologist for Dr. Kanhai instead of VUmc early in June and they wrote a referral for them ASAP. After reaching out to them I was told I could have my intake 2 months later in August on the phone, which got me very excited.
</p>
<p>
So fastforward to the intake. Something to know before meeting Dr. Kanhai, he can be fairly direct and harsh. I was aware of this and it still surprised me lmao, but in the end he&#39;s still an excellent surgeon. Dr. Kanhai checked with me if I&#39;m healthy, checked my BMI and checked down there to see if he&#39;d have enough material to work with. Luckily he doesn&#39;t require hair laser removal, because my bottom dysphoria wouldn&#39;t have allowed me to get it anyway.
</p>
<p>
This was all good and he seemed satisfied, then he told me he&#39;d put me on the waitlist for the surgery. He told me he&#39;d like me to go to an informational evening somewhere in October, this was mandatory so of course I agreed. The info told at this evening was very helpful and he really explained in detail how he was going to do the surgery with pictures and everything. He also elaborated on the after care and what to expect from the entire procedure. Something to keep in mind about this, is that you&#39;ll only be staying in the hospital for 2 nights. For me surgery day was Monday and I went home on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
During the intake he informed me it could be 3-4 months until I&#39;d be able to get surgery. After mentioning this he did ask about my medical insurance just to make sure I have one that&#39;s compatible with them and covers the entire surgery. When I told him I had ASR as my health insurance he immediately told me to switch, because ASR apparently only covers 70% of the surgery costs.
</p>
<p>
This was a huge letdown which we didn&#39;t realize during the intake, because this was the exact reason why my surgery date got delayed by an additional 4 months.
</p>
<p>
After looking into some health insurances I stumbled across Zilveren Kruis. They offered to cover the entire costs of the surgery and after reading into it some more they also offer to cover the first 13 laser/electrolysis appointments for my face. This is especially great, because I haven&#39;t started with this yet.
</p>
<p>
Now it was basically a waiting game, waiting on a call from the clinic to get an official surgery date. They however did not inform me on their own of the delay that switching my health insurance would add on top of the 3-4 months regular waitlist times. So somewhere around January is when I started to get a bit worried that they&#39;d maybe made a mistake and did not include me on their waitlist. This is when I decided to email them myself to get some info on why I hadn&#39;t been called yet.
</p>
<p>
This is when they told me they wouldn&#39;t be able to plan my SRS date until at the earliest the 21st of March. This was a huge letdown and I wish they would&#39;ve told me about this during the initial intake or atleast emailed me about it. Luckily time flew past and at the end of February I got a call from them regarding my surgery date. They told me I could get surgery as soon as 25th of March, so I immediately said yes.
</p>
<h1>
PRE-SURGERY
</h1>
<p>
After the call informing me about the surgery date I got sent a bunch of emails about when I&#39;d be expected at the clinic, what to bring and how to prepare. They also already included some dilation instructions to read through to prepare me for the aftercare. Dr. Kanhai only does 2 SRS surgeries on one day and in the mail I got instructed to come in at 6:45AM, so I was going to be the first one of the day.
</p>
<p>
After arriving at the clinic I got assigned a room by one of the nurses and instructed on the entire surgery once more with time to answer a few more of my last questions I might have. I didn&#39;t have any, because I had the opportunity to ask my questions at the informational evening already.
</p>
<p>
She informed my mom who was with me that she couldn&#39;t wait at the clinic on me to wake up, because they didn&#39;t have any room for her. This was kind of disappointing, but she prepared for this by taking a lot of stuff with her to keep her entertained. She ended up sitting at a McDonalds closeby for a few hours lmao.
</p>
<p>
The nurse laid out a surgical gown for me to put on and asked me to pee one last time if I felt the need to. After that I got in the hospital bed and had to wait approximately 10 minutes after which 2 nurses came to take my bed to the preparation/recovery room on a different floor.
</p>
<p>
In this room they hooked me up to a bunch of different medical equipment and put me on an IV that was filled with antibiotics. Here I waited around 15 minutes until Dr. Kanhai himself came up to me and told me he was all ready to start the surgery on me and they brought me to the operating room. The last thing I remember before they put me to sleep was them telling me to think of a good memory so I&#39;d wake up feeling better. This did help! :)
</p>
<h1>
POST-SURGERY
</h1>
<p>
The first thing I remember when I woke up is looking around me pretty dazed and &#39;heavy&#39; pain for a lack of a better word. It wasn&#39;t sharp, but it was like there was a very heavy object on my crotch that was pushing too hard and causing pain. I told the nurses about this immediately and they gave me some morphine through a syringe in the IV. They also gave me an ice cream, which I remember being the best ice cream ever. Probably due to the morphine lmao.
</p>
<p>
They brought me back to my room, where there was already another girl waiting to get her surgery after me. I was informed that there was a button on my bed that I only had to press and the nurses would come to aid me. I immediately called my mom to tell her I had woken up from the surgery and when she arrived we cried for a bit, it was a really happy moment.
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t allowed to immediately eat a big meal, so I was given 2 crackers with cheese and ham. I was really hungry though and kept asking for more and ended up eating like 6 crackers and falling asleep in between having had them. Every few hours I&#39;d ask for a nurse to give me more painkillers, because the &#39;heavy&#39; pain would start to increase a bit. Luckily I have to say it wasn&#39;t too bad and I&#39;d rate it a 7/10 at worst when I woke up. With painkillers it was closer to a 3.5/10, annoying but definitely manageable.
</p>
<p>
My mom was luckily allowed to stay with me during the entire day, even though they informed me beforehand in the info emails that visitors would only be allowed to stay for max 2 hours. Apparently this &#39;rule&#39; isn&#39;t really enforced. At the end of the day they gave me a bigger meal and this really helped me feel a bit less weak.
</p>
<p>
At night they gave me a morphine pill to be able to sleep, which was really effective at killing most of my pain. The pain went from annoying to a slight hindrance, so sleeping went alright. However at 3 AM I woke up to more pain again and had to request another pill to make it through the rest of the night. This luckily helped me fall right back to sleep, but upon waking up the next morning I was informed I would have to switch from morphine to regular painkillers like Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. This meant my pain would increase a bit, but it was still manageable. I&#39;d give it a 4.5/10.
</p>
<p>
Something I started to find really annoying is that this was when blood started to leak from the wound in between my legs and butt cheeks, which feels really disgusting. It was only a few droplets, but the feeling this gives is super uncomfortable. This ended in me asking a nurse every few hours to clean me down there again, which the nurses happily did. It wasn&#39;t uncomfortable having them see me completely naked, they really knew how to make me feel at ease.
</p>
<p>
This was also the moment I decided I wanted to try standing and walking around a bit more, so I asked one of the nurses to help me out of bed and stand/walk a bit. This went really well and standing was such a welcome change, since I&#39;d been laying in bed the entire day.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the day was fairly uneventful, I had some visitors come and go but I was doing pretty well  and I had more energy than the first day. At night time though, I had some trouble sleeping. During the surgery Dr. Kanhai attached 2 plastic tubes to the entrance of the vagina to keep everything close together, which we&#39;re scheduled to be removed on Wednesday (day 3). One of these tubes however started to irritate my skin on my labia majora, which was already raw from the surgery ofcourse. This gave me a lot of pain, around 7/10, in the middle of the night. I decided to call for a nurse and they immediately noticed what was hurting me and she put a piece of gauze in between the tube and my labia, which gave instant relief. After this I could sleep without any issues.
</p>
<p>
The next day they took off the tubes, which gave me the feeling I had more freedom to move around.  This was also the day I&#39;d be sent home, still with my catheter and packing in. Beforehand I knew I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to shower until the packing was removed, but it still sucked to have to use washing cloth to clean myself for an entire week. After a week I was expected to come back so Dr. Kanhai could remove the catheter and packing. This was also when a nurse instructed me how to dilate and helped me with this. After this first dilation session I was allowed to shower at the clinic for the first time in a week, which was probably the best shower I&#39;d ever had! This concludes my stay with MKV and from this point on it&#39;s only for check-ups I have to go back.
</p>
<h1>
FINAL THOUGHTS
</h1>
<p>
I think the staff of MKV really did their best to make me feel at ease for the 3 days I was there. At no point did I feel like I wasn&#39;t going to be helped to the best of their ability. My questions were answered when I had them and I can say I look back with a good feeling on the care they provided me. I can definitely recommend Dr. Kanhai and MKV for SRS! Thank you for taking the time to read this, any questions are welcome! :)
