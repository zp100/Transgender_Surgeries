Quite a bit of stuff has happened in the last week, some good, some bad, some mixed.
</p>
<p>
I had my second follow up with Emery and Celeste last Thursday (2.5 weeks post-op) to review how dilation was going, to check up on how I&#39;m healing, and to take a look at going to #3.
</p>
<p>
The good news: The separation was pretty minor and looks like it&#39;s set up into good healthy scar tissue, I&#39;m clear to start dilating with #3 once a day, and dilating with #2 has been going well.
</p>
<p>
The bad news:
</p>
<p>
My body has decided to do something novel since they saw me at 1 week post-op. Instead of the scrotal graft shedding its top layers in small pieces, it&#39;s all come off in a unit. The base layers of the graft look healthy, but there&#39;s a tube of discarded epithelial layers hanging out in my vagina, held in place by something. They&#39;ve never seen this particular variation of metaplasia, but since the underlying tissue looks OK, they&#39;re taking a wait and see approach.
</p>
<p>
Also, I got feedback from Dr. Grober (since Dr. Krakowsky was in Israel) that some of the puffy extra tissue in my vestibule was a bit of an &#39;oops&#39; and really shouldn&#39;t be there. It can be corrected once swelling goes down, in a year.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, my calf is still knotted and swollen, I&#39;ve been doing the stretches Celeste recommended, and it&#39;s still not resolved. She and Emery recommended I request referral to a sports medicine doctor back in Ottawa to try and get it resolved.
</p>
<p>
The mixed news:
</p>
<p>
#3 sort of fits. It&#39;s an intense experience going in, it tugs like crazy at some of the scarring, I can&#39;t hit full depth, and it feels like running into a wall. But I&#39;m moving up a size.
</p>
<p>
I also met up with Nolan (the social worker with the TRS program) afterwards to try to work through some of the emotional stuff I mentioned in my last update. Talking it over helped a lot, and I felt better for having gotten my feelings out there and acknowledged. There&#39;s a lot of wait and see going on, and intellectually I know that&#39;s the correct approach, but emotionally it&#39;s hard to look at my body sometimes and feel like it&#39;s still not right.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, it was a pretty busy day, my mom came down to help us get back home the next day, so I went for lunch with her, went back to ARC to dilate, rest, and start packing, and then went out again for dinner with her and my father in law. After that, I did my third dilation and almost finished packing.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Friday was the big day, leaving ARC and going home. The nurses at ARC were able to coordinate a small refill on my painkiller prescription for the trip home, which I greatly appreciated. Everyone was wonderful at ARC, and while I was ready to head home, I&#39;ll miss them. I&#39;ve been invited to drop by and visit if I happen to be in the area, which is pretty likely given my follow up schedule. We had decided to take the train home, which had seemed like a good idea since it would let me get up and stretch my legs, and it would let my mom help my wife with our daughter. In retrospect, not so much. 4 hours on a train sucked. Even with Oxy in my system it was still an endurance exercise of finding positions that didn&#39;t hurt. Driving home (with a reclined front seat) or taking the plane (a less comfortable seat, but less than 1 hour instead of 4) would probably have been a better choice. My calf wasn&#39;t too happy either, and my 2 last dilations were a bit bloody compared to normal. All in all, the day felt like a major endurance exercise. Sleeping in my own bed was amazing, I woke up a few times but it was way more comfy than the hospital bed at ARC or the gurney at WCH.

I dilated with #3 on Saturday (#2 to depth for 15 minutes, then #3 as far as I could go), it was more uncomfortable than on Thursday, and taking it out was followed by a bunch of blood. I felt pretty shaky for a few hours afterwards, and very drained for most of the day. Some of that was probably recovery from Friday, some from the &#34;holy crap, I just gushed blood from my vagina.&#34;. I didn&#39;t soak through a pad, but I&#39;ve never had that wash of bright red blood after dilating other than the very first dilation, and even then it wasn&#39;t nearly that much. I used #2 for the rest of the weekend, and was back down to my normal discharge (a tiny pink tint mixed with lube, or brownish) for all of them.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also finding that my calf and ankle are getting more sensitive to some movements. I&#39;m losing some range of motion, and can&#39;t go down stairs with anything approaching a normal gait. Hoping it doesn&#39;t get much worse before it gets better.

Monday morning I had a very WTF moment after my morning dilation, I had a small BM, and when I went to wipe I saw a tendril of whiteish stuff hanging out of my vagina. A gentle tug with TP showed that it was still attached to me and not going anywhere. I messaged Emery, and sent a photo, using the messaging app. They got back to me before I even finished describing what had happened, which was awesome. I was also very glad they&#39;d spotted the sloughing last week when they did the internal exam so I wasn&#39;t completely blind sided. They asked me to push it back in, and scheduled me in to see them on Thursday at WCH. They also asked me to keep dilating with #3, even with the blood. I was able to arrange a ride down to Toronto on Thursday with my mom, so I should be more comfortable than trying to take the train again, and way cheaper than taking the plane. I also had an appointment with my family doctor to request referral to a sports medicine doctor (done, waiting on call back from the clinic), and to discuss Doing Something about my hemorrhoids (wait until my BMs are regular again). I had another BM, and had to push the skin tube back inside again, bleh. I dilated with #3 for my evening dilation, it still sucked going in (lots of tugging on scar tissue and incision lines), it felt like it was stuck coming out (I had to very gently keep pulling on it with one hand while I gently pushed inwards around my introitus to get it out) and it was bloody again. Didn&#39;t feel as intense as on Saturday, but still... Sigh. Slept with a pad on, and woke up in pain from either my vulva or my calf multiple times.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I dilated today (Tuesday) with #3 for my afternoon dilation, and there wasn&#39;t any blood! Still sucked going in, and sucked coming out (not as badly though, I placed a bit of extra lube inside the introitus before inserting the dilator), and I felt pretty drained afterwards, but at least I didn&#39;t bleed. I&#39;ve had to push the skin tube back inside 3 times so far today, and it&#39;s getting old. I&#39;m so glad they were able to get me in on Thursday so we can Do Something about it. I also seem to be losing some of the swelling and I&#39;m starting to see some folds of skin roughly where minora should be below the urethra. They&#39;re not well defined at all, but it gives me hope that things will improve, and that (at the least) there may be enough tissue for a revision to create minora in the future. My clitoris is still feeling very puffy and exposed, I&#39;m hoping it starts to settle down too.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Bottom line, great communication and responsiveness from the team at WCH. Hearing back from Emery super fast on Monday really helped me not freak out about the skin tube. However, complications suck. I&#39;m hoping the sports medicine clinic is able to get me in relatively quickly and they&#39;ve got some insight into WTF might help my calf and ankle.

Neither had I, and I think I&#39;d have been freaking out about graft failure if I hadn&#39;t had the advanced warning.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re spot on about the douching regimen, none called for unless stuff starts going sideways. Given that the tube seemed to be solidly anchored when they examined me last week, they didn&#39;t have me start douching to try to flush it out.

Their first worry was a possible blood clot, and they did a Doppler ultrasound while I was in recovery to rule it out. It was definitely muscle cramping and swelling.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still not completely resolved, despite stretching it out, so I&#39;m waiting on the referral to sports medicine to see if they can do anything.
