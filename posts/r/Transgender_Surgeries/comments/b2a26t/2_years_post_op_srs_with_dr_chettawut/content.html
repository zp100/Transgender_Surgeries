I am not sure whether this is 100% representative of the kind of result Chettawut can offer- I have seen a series of mixed results. However, I am very lucky. What is interesting to note is that he is hyper aware of the importance of attaining as realistic a result for young girls as possible. I remember him saying &#39;this will need to last you 60 years, Miss- we must make it look good&#39;.

I think it is fair to say that the language with which we use to describe these things are messy and often intersecting though, right?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Of course, the vagina and labia are separate things. However, when we are discussing the appearance of a vulva we tend to use these terms fluidly.

That is very kind of you, I can&#39;t tell you how warming it is to have such compliments made about a part of my body I fought for. I&#39;d been really reluctant to share my experience, primarily because it is fairly atypical, in that I transitioned young and currently live in stealth. However, I became really disheartened by how one sided the narrative regarding SRS outcomes is. You&#39;re right- all you seem to hear is horror and gloom. Of course, these experiences are important to consider, but they aren&#39;t representative of the majority. As such, I wanted to talk about how positive/healthy this can be.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
That being said, I would be hesitant for people to hold my experience/result up as being representative of what SRS can/will offer. Every individual is different, with every surgery offering differing challenges. As such, each result will differ irrespective of the proficiency of the surgeon. Of course, certain surgeons employ techniques which tend to offer a certain result, which is something you should definitely consider. In turn, I feel fairly confident in recommending Dr. Chettawut.

here is a HD photo of my legs spread. I am quite fortunate that in this position my inner labia can remain together- allowing me to spread them myself if I want to reveal the clitoris/be penetrated.  It also creates this &#39;pushing into the labia effect&#39; when I am penetrated, as the vagina is well hidden behind the labia even when my legs are spread. I have found that in some cases it can look quite gaping if there isn&#39;t sufficient coverage.

Did you find the recovery painful?. I just had FFS 4 months ago, and I didn&#39;t find it painful, now I&#39;m looking into my SRS to finish my process, and I want Chettawut. But I&#39;m really scared about the pain post op. How many days until you stop feeling pain?,  which days were more painful?.

If truth be known, I didn&#39;t find it that painful. It wasn&#39;t the most comfortable of experiences, however, it wasn&#39;t anywhere near as painful as I had predicted it would be. Of course, there were moments. However, it wasn&#39;t a constant.
</p>
<p>
If anything, I found it to be emotionally draining. The exhaustion is really limiting. Equally, being room bound can drive you crazy, so be prepared for this. Sleeping can also be rather difficult due to the logistics of positioning yourself in a way which won&#39;t be painful being quite challenging at times.
</p>
<p>
The part that I found most painful was the bowel preparation prior to surgery, which saw me spend the days prior on the toilet being sick and having diarrhoea.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the compliment, I am really rather happy with it.

I’m hesitant as well. I think mainly it’s the cost, and the idea of flying out there. The recovery doesn’t seem great fun either lol...

The cost of this surgery is perhaps the greatest impediment to access, irrespective of intent/desire. There are many people that desperately want this surgery but  simply cannot afford it. That being said, it doesn&#39;t always have to be as expensive as it appears. Looking to Thailand, especially for those coming from the US/UK, can often change/increase the feasibility of the surgery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re scared of flying, international journeys for what ever reason will be difficult. However, I personally believe that their are such centres of excellence in terms of results and technique in Thailand that such journeys, irrespective of how difficult they may be, are very worth while.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Recovery will be the same everywhere. The greatest factor to consider is not where you have it, but how your body will uniquely respond to it. Everyone is different.

Dilation. Not a very original response to that question, however. The big issue for me will be mostly related to hygiene since I live with pets and I can&#39;t (and wouldn&#39;t) just throw them away. Dilating thrice a day while keeping everything clean (fur free) down there might not be super fun.
</p>
<p>
It is not an issue big enough to make me reconsider having surgery, though. There are other issues such as staying one month in Thailand (away from my pets lol) but I would rather suffer the pain of missing them than suffer with at the hands of the butchers in the country I live in.

It was a little painful at first, but then it turned into mostly a big chore, time consuming activity you need to partaking in several times a day. Dilating multiple times a day, at least two, is essential. When I had the revision with Chett on July 10, I only dilated again in the evening of July 11, and it was super tight with dilator 0.
</p>
<p>
I am traveling home now, almost there, and I haven&#39;t dilated for over a day because of the very long trip. Not looking forward to my first dilation in a long time.
</p>
<p>
It is not hellish at all, though. Just boring. Hellish is the trip back home, if you leave too far away from Thailand (my case). Girl,  you have no idea how sore I am right now.

A variety of factors. On the one hand, i think i like having a dick. On the other, ive dreamt of what it would feel like to be penetrated vaginally and it makes me so happy when i have dreams where i have a vagina.

Like I said, Chettawut is really worth considering. Admittedly the Suporn Clinic has achieved the monopoly in Thailand. However, the Chettawut Clinic offers a service which is a lot more accessible, primarily due to a shorter waiting list and slightly more affordable as a result of a smaller surgical fee.

I think that the most important thing that I would recommend to any person considering this surgery is to do sufficient research. Though it might seem like an impossible achievement right now, allowing yourself to centre that goal and consider the possibility of it is what will sustain you through the waiting. Meanwhile, allowing yourself to do research will ensure that if/when you come to be able to actualise that goal, you&#39;ll be making the best decision for you.

I went to Chettawut too. A little less than 2 yrs ago. I think your vagina looks much better than mine. I’m not 100% happy with mine; despite having no complications it didn’t turn out as visually perfect.
</p>
<p>
Despite not being his best work, compared to other surgeons results, especially US surgeons, I think mine still looks way better.
</p>
<p>
I recently got my hair removed around my vagina, and my laser tech who knows I’m trans was stunned at how natural and great my vagina looks. Again, despite it looking worse than yours and IMO not being Chet’s best work. I think that says a lot about just how good Chettawut is.
</p>
<p>
Overall I’m still very glad I went to Chet. He is clearly the best in the world at creating a visually beautiful and natural looking vagina.

<p>
The question is though, is it possible to be 100% happy with it?
</p>
<p>
Admittedly there are certain reasonable expectations to have, however, beyond that it is very easy to become obsessive about detail. Of course, my vagina isn&#39;t perfect. Of course, any kind of revision work would likely enhance it&#39;s aesthetics. However, given where I am already at, why would I obsess over that? I feel like I lucked out and so am trying to be grateful for where I am at. I have a great vagina which is enjoyed by myself and others.
</p>
<p>
Also, I see a lot of girls on here obsessing over the smallest of details, yet many of them are currently not sexually active, nor will they likely be. Yes, my vagina isn&#39;t perfect. However, I function as a woman and am able to have pleasurable sex with partners of my choosing. Would changing the aesthetics of my vagina enhance that? Of course not. The fact that I am able to engage in relations with people without having to disclose, is not due to the aesthetics of my vagina- it&#39;s due to my wider passibility.
</p>
<p>
I think people forget that having visible &#39;male markers&#39; elsewhere is going to be more of a &#39;give away&#39; than having a degree of vulva diversity. You can have a perfect pussy but if you don&#39;t look like a woman, what good does it achieve?
</p>
<p>
The vast majority of results that come out of the Chettawut and Suporn Clinic&#39;s are far superior to anything that I have seen coming out of Western Clinics. Though your concerns are obviously meaningful to you, when compared to theirs, they are likely minuscule. Obviously it is hard to put this into perspective, however, if you&#39;re ever feeling concerned about how yours looks- just take a look at some of the results that get posted on here...
</p>
<p>
Out of interest, have you heard anything about Chet&#39;s revision policy? I was having a conversation with someone on here the other day who said that a handful of girls have been told that he won&#39;t perform them, in spite of having suggested he would during their original consultation. I am not sure I&#39;ll be getting a revision any time soon, however, I think it is important to be aware of.

Please ignore if this is too personal question, but how does it feel to masturbate or have sex with SRS vagina?

I think it is important to recognise that masturbation and sex are two very different things. Though they may occasionally intersect, they are not mutually exclusive and should be considered separately/contextual to the situation in which they occur/overlap.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Masturbation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<em>
Masturbation performed by myself:
</em>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Like most women this is something that I have grown into, creating a relationship with my  vagina which continues to evolve and change.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Due to a fairly low libido and a certain amount of anxiety regarding masturbation, I didn&#39;t actually start exploring my vagina by myself until around 6 months post op. In the beginning I was fairly uncertain about what to do- remember, you aren&#39;t provided with an instruction manual.
</p>
<p>
However, as time progressed I slowly began to stimulate my clitoris and eventually began to bring myself to orgasm. Given that many men and women have failed to conceptualise the orgasm, never mind express it through language, I won&#39;t waste time trying to do so. All I can say is that I can orgasm, it feels different- though equally, if not more pleasurable than before-  and that I am very happy  with my how my clitoris functions.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<em>
Masturbation performed by others:
</em>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
This really does depend on your partner. I have had a really variety of experiences. However, other people have been able to bring me to climax through stimulation. So, it is possible... apparently.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sex
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
My perspective on this is massively influenced by the fact that, due to my age, I hadn&#39;t had a significant amount of sexual experiences prior to surgery. I was nineteen when I had my surgery, so my expectations were very different to someone well into their sexual life.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
In spite of coming out of surgery with 6 inches of depth, it is fair to say that I was fairly anxious about my ability to engage in penetrative sex. Based on the fact that the average penis size, at least in the UK, is below 6 inches and that dilators are a lot more rigid than penises, I am not sure why I was so nervous. However, for the first 6 months I avoided having sex as a result of this.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I eventual did give it a go though and much to my surprise it worked. In fact, not only did it work, however, it was also pleasurable. Admittedly I was very naive about how my body worked, especially in relation to a sexual partner, so these early experiences were fairly messy and didn&#39;t necessarily confirm to my expectations of what sex would be like. However, I was still only 20 at this stage, so this wasn&#39;t an uncommon experience for someone my age. As such, the partners that I had, also close to me in age and experience, were patient and fumbled along with me towards better sex.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Since that first experience I have gone on to have a variety of partners, all of whom have had different levels of experience and varying penis sizes. As my experience and confidence has grown, I have been able to welcome this diversity, always able to accommodate and enjoy sex irrespective of the experience or penis size of my partner.
</p>
<p>
Though it is problematic to centre experiences which perpetuate this idea that Trans women are some how fooling their partners, I think it is important to note that none of my sexual partners, even the most experienced, have commented on or identified a difference between my vagina and what they expect/have experienced a cis one to be like. All of my sexual encounters have taken place before/without disclosure of my status.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Of my sexual partners, two were  later informed of my status. In both instances I had engaged with these people multiple times before disclosing and went onto have long, healthy sexual relations post disclosure. Both of them were surprised, commenting on how comparable it was to their cis partners. Again, this isn&#39;t something we should centre, or hold up as being representative of &#39;success&#39; post srs, however, I do believe it is something people are interested in.

Hi, I&#39;ve got a couple questions. Did you need to use lube in order to be penetrated? If not, how much foreplay did you need to get to this point?
</p>
<p>
Also, if you have been with men who had more penis than you had vaginal depth, how did it go? Did their dick just go all the way and then stop at the end of your vagina? Or does it stretch at all? Did they have any issue, ask any questions, or make any comments?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Also, at what point did you start doing dilations once per day? Did you follow his dilation schedule to a T? Or did you personalize it?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I have my own surgery with Chett on 14 May, so I&#39;m so excited. Love your vagina by the way.

This is such a difficult question to answer because I have had such a mixed bunch of experiences.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Again, I am no Doctor. Yet I am also no conspiracist theorist. As such, I am going to be really careful about how I word this response. I don&#39;t want to build up impossible expectation. However, I have had a dozen or so sexual encounters when, without any lube, I have been able to have penetrative sex. Whether this is because of the area being wet itself or not, I couldn&#39;t comment. In spite of these token experiences though, for the most part sex without any kind of lubricant isn&#39;t really something I&#39;d consider. If you are having regular sex though you have to be fairly mature about it, recognising that it&#39;s just unfortunately a necessary part of what will help you function as you wish.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
As such, for the most part I use lube- if anything for peace of mind. As you progress through your recovery you become better at using it, allowing it to become increasingly less obvious that it is even being used. For the most part I just put some lube on in the bathroom before having sex, often without my partner recognising. Again though, it is important to recognise just how many cis women also have to use some form of lubricant. In turn, this is something that you can have a conversation about with your partner without feeling like you are going to have to disclose/be clocked. I just choose not to make it a conversation as it isn&#39;t something that I think is necessary. Quick visit to the bathroom. All done.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Like I said, I don&#39;t think I quite realised how different a dilator is to a penis. Firstly, all of the dilators are longer than the average penis. If you&#39;re able to sustain a depth north of 5.5 inches, combined with the width of the largest dilator and the rigidity of the acrylic, you shouldn&#39;t have any problems. That being said, it isn&#39;t impossible that you won&#39;t encounter someone that is too big, or too thick.
</p>
<p>
Remember though, this is an experience
<strong>
a lot of cis women will encounter
</strong>
. Since being post op I have had sex with a couple of really big guys, one of whom commented that 80% of girls, presumably all cis, that he had been with had been unable to &#39;take&#39; his penis properly. In turn, I think it is important to recognise that our expectations of what our vaginas should be like are often very misguided, nuanced less by the realities of this World and more by the fantasies of our mind.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
In terms of dilation, I am really not a case study to follow. If truth be known, I became somewhat lazy with the routine after about three months. I think what was my real saving grace, certainly in terms of not loosing any depth during that period is that I&#39;d advanced through the dilation sizes a lot quicker than most. In fact, I believe I was on number 3 before I left Thailand. If you do ever slip behind with your dilation though, remember that it is for the most part just about stretching the area back out. Return to dilator 0/1 and work you way back up and soon enough you&#39;ll be back where you were. I am now able to dilate as infrequently as I want, though I aim to do it at least once or twice a week depending on my schedule. When I do dilate now I just use the largest dilator, which is always really affirming giving how small the first dilator you start off with is. What I will say is that, even if you are having regular penetrative sex, that occasional dilation can make your sex life a lot easier and can bring additional peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I am so excited for you, how are you feeling about the surgery?
</p>
<p>
Please do not hesitate to ask me any additional questions.

Wow thank you so much for such an elaborate response. This definitely helped me get an idea for what I can expect. Self lubrication is very important to me, and I hope to have results similar to yours. Do people ever notice your scars and comment on them?
</p>
<p>
&amp; I have no words to describe how excited I am. I literally never shut up about it lol. I’m kinda nervous about my general safety being in Thailand though because I am very small and blonde so I think I’ll stick out like a sore thumb. I also don’t know what to wear and what isn’t appropriate lmao. But we’ll figure it out.

If truth be known, the scars are mostly visible in the photo as a result of my HD camera. When I am standing they are totally invisible, as they hide nicely within the crease of the groin. I have never had a partner comment on them. Of the lovers that I have had, two were later informed of my status and neither of them pointed them out in spite of the fact that we went on to have sex many times post disclosure.
</p>
<p>
What you will learn as you begin to have sex is that it is a game of logistics. It is possible to have sex without getting yourself into a position- pun intended- where they are visible. However, if you&#39;re wanting to be vulnerable and less contrived then it is something you have to potentially consider.
</p>
<p>
The scars are there and you have to be prepared for them. Of course, they fade over time. Eventually becoming pretty insignificant. However, unless you&#39;re planning on having scar therapy, or treatment on the area, they are something you&#39;ll have to come to live with.

Again, I am no Doctor. However, it seems to be that non-penile inversion techniques are more successful at creating depth than traditional penile inversion techniques. If you are lacking in donor material, as I was having been on puberty blockers for many years before, this can be an important consideration. Additionally, non-penile inversion techniques tend to have less complications. However, this is a fairly anecdotal summary as I am basing this on the experiences of those I know.

Were you circumcised before or did you suffer from phimosis? Did Dr Chettawut say anything or share his thoughts on how he feels it may affect the results if a patient were to have been?

I hadn&#39;t been circumcised, nor had I suffered from phimosis pre-surgery. However, I had been on a GnRH analogue (puberty blocker) in the years prior to surgery, so donor material wasn&#39;t as sufficient as it might have been had I gone through my natal puberty. The fact that Dr. Chettawut was able to respond to that consideration as he did, providing me with the depth that he did makes me think that he&#39;d be able to factor in circumcision, or phimosis.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
That being said, I can only offer an anecdotal response. I&#39;d suggest emailing the Chettawut Clinic if you have any questions pertaining to your individual experience, and of how this may/may not impact your surgery or the result you might get from Dr. Chettawut.

Forgive me if I am being too curious, however, are these experiences you have had? If they are, like I said in my previous message, I would make sure you relay these to your surgeon and discuss with them how they feel it will impact any potential surgery/results.

No problem with that. Not circumcised, but Phimosis is an issue at the moment and I am working towards fixing it myself which I am seeing great progress in which is good. Its weird only a few months ago I had never see my glands before only the very top but now I can fully retract when flacid.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still a little tighter than I would like atm and I want to make it good for when I have my surgery so that there is no issues with it for my surgeon. But continuing to stretch is helping heaps and is much better than getting material loss with a voluntary circumcision.
</p>
<p>
Hey I too am on GnRH analogue (Lucrin) for the last two years and heard that just stretching out my tissue (like scrotal) while doing my other stretches would be a good idea. You must be in NZ or Aus for lucrin, lol. :)

The fact that I had been on the blockers meant that the donor material was always going to be different than had I gone through my natal puberty, however, I did as much as I could to ensure that I &#39;didn&#39;t loose what I had&#39;. Stretching of both the penile and scrotal skin can definitely help ensure that this doesn&#39;t happen, or reduce the effects of it happening.

I heard that it could cause tightness somewhere in the final result thought it&#39;s not certain. I do know that when they begin work on you one of the first things they do is &#39;retract&#39; you so they can start disassembling the member into its components.  If you can&#39;t retract at all by your self before hand, once you are in surgery they may need to cut you vertically down the forskin the expose the head. I am sure this would differ depending on if it was the Inversion or non Inversion method.

Honestly I’m pretty much sold. I’ve heard lots of great things this doctors work and was already leaning in thus direction. What about cost, logistics, insurance etc.  Granted I’m pretty far away from being ready, it’s good to be informed.

As a point of reference, all of this is coming from the perspective of someone who was travelling from the UK.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cost:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The cost of surgery was 346,000 Baht, which at current conversion rate is about £8,000 or near $11,000. There might be some change to this, as I had my surgery in 2017. However, I wouldn&#39;t expect there to be much of a change.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Alongside surgery the following things have to be considered in terms of pricing up the cost of the whole experience:
</p>
<p>
.Travel to Thailand*- often international.
</p>
<p>
.Hotel stay* whilst in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
.Spending money* whilst in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
* all of these will vary depending on your circumstances/preferences.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Logistics:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I had to fly from London to Bangkok.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I spent 5 weeks in Bangkok, staying not far from the Chettawut Clinic, before flying back to London from Bangkok.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Insurance:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I am not sure exactly what you&#39;re asking here, could you specify?
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you have any specific questions, I&#39;d be happy to answer them.

Do they accept any form of insurance? Or would I have to pay out of pocket and get it reimbursed? I’m now working for Starbucks whose benefits cover transgender needs.

<p>
From what I can understand this question has two points of resolution.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Firstly,
<strong>
does the Chettawut clinic accept any/particular forms of insurance?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I am not 100% sure, however, my guess would be
<strong>
no.
</strong>
I would recommend getting in touch with Som, the business manager at the clinic though. I suspect she can provide an accurate answer, will be able to better explore this issue with you.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Secondly,
<strong>
does my scheme provide scope for the funding of surgery abroad?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t something I can answer without being privy to your policy details, so I would suggest doing some research yourself into this. Consulting with your provider will significantly advance your understanding of this.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Again, this is a somewhat anecdotal response. However, I do believe that some companies, though not directly funding surgery abroad, are able to re-imburse the costs paid initially upfront. I&#39;d look into whether this is an option, especially if the Chettawut Clinic do not accept insurance referrals.

Absolutely beautiful. Imo, everything I’ve seen from Dr Chettawut is astounding work and he’s the one I want to go to one of these days. Not to say that Dr Suporn’s work isn’t great too, but I just always feel like Chettawut’s work is the best.

That is very kind of you, I am certainly very happy with my results.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Like I said in my original post, Dr. Chettawut does offer a very different experience to Dr. Suporn. That is something that I would advise everyone to be very conscious of before proceeding with him. Though he is able to offer a very high quality of result, many people will prefer to go to less reputable surgeons due to the way in which his package of aftercare is structured. For those that want a similar kind of result, Dr. Suporn is certainly the more prestige option. Primarily in that the package of care you&#39;ll receive is a lot more in keeping with our Western expectations/experiences.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I went to Dr. Chettawut due to scheduling, as the Suporn Clinic wasn&#39;t able to offer me a solid date for near eighteen months and I didn&#39;t feel I was emotionally prepared to have to wait for a cancellation. Upon reflection I think I lucked out, with my result being as good, if not better than a lot of the results that I have seen come out of the Suporn Clinic. However, if I were able to go back and repeat my experience I suspect had Suporn been a viable option, given how much more consistent his results seem to be, I would have likely chosen him over Chettawut.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Out of interest, are you planning on having your surgeon with Chettawut then?

I mean, it’s still a few years out and my opinion may change between now and then, but I do lean toward Chettawut.

Would you care to go into some more detail about the differences in their aftercare packages?

You&#39;re very welcome but it&#39;s you I should thank. My questions have already been asked and answered. What the cost was, and possible issues with lack of skin from me being badly circumcised were the the things I wanted to know about, and your answers were very helpful and reassuring!

How exciting! September will come along soon enough. If you have any questions about Dr. Chettawut, his staff or your time in Thailand, do not hesitate to ask.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If truth be known, Chettawut isn&#39;t terribly proficient in English. Though he is able to have very in depth conversations about particular surgeries in English, it can be difficult to understand him if you verge off of the talking points. That being said, there are people within the clinic with whom you could relay more detailed requests too and they will be able to communicate this in Thai to him.
</p>

The primary concern for both Dr. Chettawut and myself in terms of aesthetic was my age. I was nineteen at the time of my surgery and Dr. Chettawut was quite conscious of the fact that because I would likely go on to have as active a sex life as my peers, that the result needed to be as good possible. We didn&#39;t discuss specifics, however, he made it very clear that he would do all that he could to make sure I came out with a fitting result. In fact, he suggested that he would be taking more time with me. Something he has apparently been known to do with younger girls.

I&#39;d be keen to dismiss this idea that you can &#39;pick your vagina&#39; though. What you already have between your legs is what will primarily determine the outcome of your surgery. Of course, Dr. Chettawut will be keen to create as aestehtically pleasing a result as possible, however, it will still be very individual to each person.

I didn&#39;t need a skin graft, surprisingly. I had been preparing myself for the possibility, however, he was confident he wouldn&#39;t need one. I managed to come out with 6 inches of depth.
</p>
<p>
I stayed at the Princess Dust. Of the three that the clinic recommends, this is undoubtably the best. Not only does it conform to Western expectations of what a hotel should be like, however, the staff and service is incredible. Equally, it&#39;s fairly affordable.
</p>
<p>
My original via allowed me to stay for the required time, I just had to present a letter from Dr. Chettawut at the Thai Consulate explaining the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
I started with two travel companions, however, I ended up with one due to work commitments. I&#39;d suggest you travel with someone, you&#39;d be surprised by how vulnerable you can be during recovery. Do you have someone coming with you?
</p>
<p>
If you have any more questions then just ask away- I am more than happy to answer them.

I have a good friend who went to Chet 2 years before me. She was not pleased with her large labia and wanted it reduced. After emailing and sending photos to Som, Dr Chettawut agreed to do the revision for free. But since she lives in the US like me, the cost of travel and hotel expenses would add real money cost to the procedure.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately she decided to get the revision done at a local plastic surgeon for about the same cost as travel. The surgeon had done labiaplasty for cis women but not trans women. But he said the concept is the same and that it’s a simple and quick procedure. The surgery went well and now she is happy with her vagina.
</p>
<p>
Maybe since he is busier now with the retirement of Suporn, Chettawut is less likely to offer free revisions? That’s my guess.

I&#39;ve been reading this thread since yesterday. I never realized that I would need srs. But reading that the realities aren&#39;t that bad and the cost isn&#39;t insane. I&#39;ve saved up for ffs over the past few years and I think I can do it again for srs. If anything I&#39;ll be able to do it quicker since I have a better job these days. I never thought I&#39;d get to have a vagina but it seems within reach now. Especially with this method. I genuinely think I can get through it. Holy shit.

Obviously SRS isn&#39;t necessary or accessible for all. However, if you are able to work towards getting it then I cannot recommend it highly enough. Beyond the obvious sexual elements, having the surgery allowed me to get rid of an awful lot of my dysphoria. I can now go swimming. Go to the gym. Go through airport security. All without worrying about having to tuck/conceal the appendage.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
That being said, I do believe that
<strong>
transition is a marathon and not a race
</strong>
. You can do both your SRS and FFS. However, Ensuring that you can have your FFS is a top priority. Though genital dysphoria can be very overwhelming, it isn&#39;t something that others often have the ability to notice or comment on- your face, on the other hand is visible to the World. If it&#39;s a coin throw between getting your FFS or having SRS, ask yourself,
<em>
&#39;what is going to make my life easier?
</em>
&#39;
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
When you do get to a stage where SRS is an option, do look into Dr. Chettawut. Like I have said before, the Suporn Clinic has positioned itself as the &#39;premier&#39; destination for SRS in Thailand. However, Dr. Chettawut is a close second. Irrespective, remember that the kind of result that the non-penile inversion method offers is far superior to anything that you&#39;ll get in the West.

Hey, congratulations, it looks perfect.
</p>
<p>
I have a question, did you have laser or electrolysis down there prior to the surgery?
</p>
<p>
Have you had problems of hair inside the vagina?

<p>
Similarly to Suporn, Chettawut doesn&#39;t require that you have laser or electrolysis prior to surgery. I think that this is a massive advantage, especially given the financial and physical inconvenience of having to have laser/electrolysis. This is because they scrape the hair follicles off during the surgery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
That being said, there have been reports of girls from both Suporn and Chettawut complaining that in spite of the follicles being screamed during the surgery, hair continues to grow around the entrance to the vagina. Again, this is something I have not experienced. Though their have been well documented cases of this happening, it remains uncommon.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
If you are concerned about this issue though, perhaps because of how your hair grows, I&#39;d suggest you contact the clinic as they&#39;d be better able to give you assurances and explore this issue further with you.

Anything can happen. In the mean time, centre other more achievable goals and slowly but surely you&#39;ll progress towards a place where getting surgery might become more and more realistic.

This is, no kidding, my greatest dream. Glad to see you had such a successful outcome! May I ask you an apparently silly question which, however, constitutes one of my major concerns? Hence, what is it like to use the toilet, to pee as a post-op female? I was told it can be very problematic for a long time after surgery. I already sit all the time and I will never miss the ability of doing it while standing but as far as I know you need to learn what little girls are taught upon being potty trained :)

No question is silly.
</p>
<p>
If truth be known, it is quite a strange experience in the beginning. I remember joking to my travel companion that I&#39;d wanted a &#39;vagina installed, not a water feature&#39;. It does take a little bit of getting used to, however, it isn&#39;t unmanageable. The first few experiences can be quite overwhelming, especially the first time after they&#39;ve taken the catheter out.
</p>
<p>
That initial craziness does dissipate though, eventually settling down and it becoming second nature. It&#39;ll flow naturally-no pun intended. I had no issues moving forward.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any other questions?

Congratulations on your fantastic result!  I’m your current age and going to Chettawut in June.
</p>
<p>
My only question is how much input were you able to give on your desired aesthetic.  I frequently see results and discussions about how Chet gives a “Barbie doll” vagina with less pronounced or sometimes absent labia minora.  Personally, I would prefer to have mine more defined, and I’m not sure if he’d be able to accommodate that request.
</p>
<p>
Cheers!

I think referencing a previous answer might be useful:
</p>
<p>
If truth be known, Chettawut isn&#39;t terribly proficient in English. Though he is able to have very in depth conversations about particular surgeries in English, it can be difficult to understand him if you verge off of the talking points. That being said, there are people within the clinic with whom you could relay more detailed requests too and they will be able to communicate this in Thai to him.
</p>
<p>
The primary concern for both Dr. Chettawut and myself in terms of aesthetic was my age. I was nineteen at the time of my surgery and Dr. Chettawut was quite conscious of the fact that because I would likely go on to have as active a sex life as my peers, that the result needed to be as good possible. We didn&#39;t discuss specifics, however, he made it very clear that he would do all that he could to make sure I came out with a fitting result. In fact, he suggested that he would be taking more time with me. Something he has apparently been known to do with younger girls.

Of course, Dr. Chettawut will be keen to create as aestehtically pleasing a result as possible, however, it will still be very individual to each person.
</p>
<p>
If you look at my results you can see that I am far from a &#39;Barbie Doll&#39;. If my experience is anything to go off of, I suspect that Dr. Chettawut will be keen to make yours look as natural as possible.

Thank you for the quick and thorough reply!  Yeah, I would honestly call most of Dr. Chett’s results phenomenal, even ones where people have self reported themselves as wishing they had slightly different aesthetics, so I’m not terribly worried.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, I appreciate your responses here and elsewhere in this thread as it’s helped ease some anxiety I didn’t even know I had.  Thanks again!

That is actually where I stayed. I can&#39;t speak highly enough of the staff, or the experience. Beyond conforming to Western expectations regarding what a hotel is like, it is also right next to a large shopping Mall providing you with plenty to do before/after your surgery.

That’s fantastic to hear!  I’ve been worried I’m going to become restless with nothing to do for a month.

How was your experience with the food there?  Did you get food service most days?  I know the hotel doesn’t have a kitchenette, so making food would be a tad difficult.

Are you travelling alone?

<p>
For the most part I ordered room service, yes. In fact, I used to order food 2-3 times a day. Eventually the menu becomes a little boring, however, by the time that happens you should be able to venture over to the shopping Mall where this is much more variety. There is a large food court, along with various restaurants.

I’m traveling with my girlfriend thankfully!
</p>
<p>
I’m glad to hear there’s some variety with food options!  Of curiousity, what amount of the food there seemed meat based?  I’m vegan and while I don’t mind compromising by going vegetarian a little, I don’t think I’d be able to do meat.

If I were you I would consult with the Clinic regarding what their advice is regarding your diet post surgery. I am not 100% certain, however, they might have some thoughts regarding you sustaining your veganism during the immediate recovery.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that though, I suspect you&#39;ll be fine. Not only is Thai cuisine fairly broad, but also the Western options available in the mall are quite varied. Your Girlfriend will have to scout out the options for you. There is even a Tesco&#39;s in the mall, if you can believe it.

I was actually meant to have my surgery in July 2016, however, due to the passing of my Grandmother I was unable to commit to the date in the end.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I believe that I resumed conversations about scheduling around October 2016, before agreeing on a date in July 2017 somewhere around November/December.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Som, the business manager at the Clinic, is very good at dealing with scheduling. I&#39;d advise you contact her if you are interested in finding out more.

Thank you, I am very happy with the result. Certainly feel like I lucked out, thats for sure.

In 2017 it was 340,000 TBH. I am not 100% sure what it is in 2019, however, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll have gone up drastically. The Chettawut clinic has positioned itself as an economical alternative to the Suporn Clinic, so I suspect they&#39;ll always be within this ball park.

Remember to factor in in hotel stay, flights and spending money. However, it&#39;ll still come in cheaper than paying out of pocket in the US.

Omg your vag is literally so beautiful, congrats! I have literally waited almost a year just to get added onto the wait list of the local surgeons to me. The results I’ve seen are good (I wouldn’t say as perfect as yours, but still good) and better than most of the other prominent surgeons in the USA, but now I’m like omg I should go to where you went!

Would you be getting surgery as a result of an insurance plan, or would you be paying out of pocket? If it is the latter then I highly suggest you look into the possibility of going to Thailand, the results are far superior to what Western surgeons can offer.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I am not sure if you are aware, however, Dr. Suporn and Dr. Chettawut both use a non-penile inversion technique, which has been shown to produce greater depth and a more atypical vulva. In countries like America, however, surgeons continue to use the outdated penile inversion technique.

Well, I&#39;d look into whether your insurance company is able to refund out of pocket costs. I believe some do.

Did you have these procedures done in the US?

So, Chettawut gives you 5 dilatorS, ranging from 0-4.
</p>
<p>
I now use no.4, which is the largest, once a week for 60 minutes.

Yeah I’ve had all my plastic surgery in the US. I’m a nurse and have always been Leary of out of country procedures but that pertains more to like girls that get ffs or fillers in Mexico, I suppose. They do reimburse me for genital electrolysis so I’m sure they’d be willing to reimburse me for something that would save them 15k lol

I&#39;m extremely impressed with your new vagina.  Congratulations.  I&#39;m gunna get one myself asap. Just one question. The first time you had penetrative sex with your new Vagina where the man ejaculated inside you, what was your first thoughts ? Were they thoughts about, &#34;Geez I&#39;m glad thats over, or, I wonder how long that&#39;s gunna stay in me, or, YES I&#39;m finally a woman, or what ?&#34; Sorry if this question is too personal but I  just don&#39;t know how I would feel the first time a man &#34;unloaded&#34; in my brand spanking new Vagina.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: What made you choose Dr. Chettawut over other surgeons? Do you recommend Dr. Chettawut? And how do you keep your results in terms of cosmetics, sensitivity and depth? How was the stay in Thailand? How was Dr. Chettawut&#39;s aftercare? Have you tried the dilators of the soul? And if you used them, is there any advantage? And by the way many congratulations for the surgery.
</p>
