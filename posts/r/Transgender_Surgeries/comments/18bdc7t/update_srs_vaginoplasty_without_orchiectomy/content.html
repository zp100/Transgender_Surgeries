Hi! I&#39;m giving an update to my previous
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/14jt2vj/had_piv_without_orchi_2wks_postop_ama/">post
</a>
.
</p>
<p>
I had my first surgery in June with Dr Hanna. Healing overall went well, though around 4 weeks there was a lot of sudden jolts of pain due to the nerves reconnecting. Also, the sutures the secured one of my testes in place did not take due to the swelling, which made things look asymmetrical. One side had a labia minora and the other side did not. I also did not get the depth I wanted but I knew this was a possibility up front due to needing enough material to hold the testes. Aesthetically, my testes were definitely visible in smaller sacks at the upper corners of the labia. It was not an issue for me but it wasn&#39;t the cutest look. I was Dr Hanna&#39;s first patient with this request so I did not expect the Michelangelo of results. Overall I was happy with the experience and started planning for a revision around month three.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Revision:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Dr Littleton for a revision and they were able to get me scheduled very quick. I had a revision with him in November. The revision included a jejunal graft for more depth and some cosmetic revisions to the vulva to secure the fallen testicle and give me a more natal appearance. Dr Littleton was great and truly cared about the end results being as perfect as possible. My quote was around $20k EUR and required me to travel to Lisbon, Portugal. Dr Littleton does surgeries between Brazil and Portugal depending on the time of the year.
</p>
<p>
I arrived in town five days before surgery and spent 10 days in the hospital after the surgery and stayed another 5 days in town resting in an airbnb. The hospital stay wasn&#39;t bad, but I got antsy after the first couple days since the doctor said no walking for five days. The language barrier was tough, but all of the nurses were great and really nice. A few spoke bits of English and google translate came in handy. I only had pain the first night in my abdomen, but no pain after that. Dr Littleton visited me every single day to check on things and is quite strict on following aftercare. I did not dilate until two weeks post op per his instructions.
</p>
<p>
The end results look great! I have a more natal looking vulva with pronounced labia minora, at least 5.5 inches of depth, and my testes are hardly visible at all. The testes are in the same location between the mons pubis and labia majora, except now the skin is tighter around them so it looks smooth and hardly visible. My vulva looks like the patients of Dr Littleton, he does very well with delivering on his aesthetic. I do not have any pain in my vulva nor my testes. I&#39;m still swollen. Dilating has been fine, I was instructed to use food grad coconut oil only. I&#39;m working on sizing up the dilators for girth as first priority and can look towards stretching for depth later.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I very happy with the path I went. I was able to use insurance to pay for the initial surgery, and paid out of pocket for the revision to get me to the finish line. I&#39;m still not onboard with posting pics to immortalize my vaj on the internet yet, but maybe one day.

How are your testosterone levels? I remember reading something like that testicles dont work/survive in internal body temperatures hence why they are external?
</p>
<p>
Are they functioning normally? Do you feel them if you put pressure in that area?

Haven&#39;t been tested yet. So far functioning as they were before and I do not feel any noticeable pressure on them.

I did not know that testicle preserving vaginoplasty was a thing! I had been told it was impossible! I&#39;m curious, are there activities that cause the testes pain or discomfort? Sex is absolutely something that I am thinking of there, but I don&#39;t want to pry to much or if that&#39;s something your body is even ready for.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing your details!

Crossing my legs is a little more challenging. Other than that I was able to do normal activities. I do not have any feedback regarding sex yet.

That makes sense. Again, thanks for being open to questions here, the path you&#39;re taking is one that I had not thought was possible, and I&#39;m actively looking into it myself.

Very cool, thank you for sharing. Feel free to ignore if you’re not taking questions, but has anyone speculated on the effect to your sperm count/fertility? I’d imagine the positioning much closer to the body might cause issue with sperm production.

Hi! My first surgeon mention a potential reduction in sperm count and needing to get tested for testicular cancer periodically, same as any cis guy with testicles should. I&#39;m not planning to have kids, but if I ever do I would get tested for sperm production at that point. In terms of hormones, I&#39;m fine there and do not need to take hrt, which was the main goal.

Where did they put the testes? Are they still external in the labia,  or actually in the inguinal canals.

They are internal in the upper part of the outer labia, right where the labia meets my mons pubis. It&#39;s kind of at the entrance of the inguinal canal, but not inside. So my testes are not visible just looking at it.

Interesting,  I&#39;m going to have a penile preserving vaginoplasty.  And wasn&#39;t sure what to do with them, or if I would have to have an orchi.

How feasible is it to do vaginoplasty without orchiectomy?

Quite feasible, I&#39;ve done it. Although it can be a challenge to find a surgeon who will perform the procedure. I did a fair bit of asking around before finding a couple surgeons who would do it. Not a lot of surgeons will try some thing new or that&#39;s not mainstream.

Would you mind naming all the surgeons you contacted and what they said. It might save others time.

Dear Artist, I have been searching for this solution for some time until I came across your extensive reporting on how you went with this. I had asked also in my hospital in Amsterdam but they would not do this.
</p>
<p>
A question I have is whether is was also considered to have the testicles placed deeper, like in the inguinal canal or abdomen, or is that no option?
</p>
<p>
I think my insurance will not cover an operation in the US. I wonder if I fund the operation with dr Hanna myself, at what cost would I deal with? Maybe you can let me know in private if you do not want to share that in public. Thank you much for your help.
