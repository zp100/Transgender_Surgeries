Idk how much depth I got back but I know I&#39;ll be going up four sizes in dilators for width. Going up that many sizes was painful enough for them to put me under anesthesia and give me fentanyl during surgery. I&#39;m glad I was under for it. Just normal dilation hurts enough before the surgery today.

Edit: Packing is currently in my vagina until sometime next week. I will learn how much depth and width I have after it is removed.

Itâ€™s would be great if you can make some updates over time as this procedure is not discussed much.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind saying who your surgeon was?

Thanks, I don&#39;t see any captions on old reddit, which I use. I do see it on new reddit.

Dr. Ramineni 7 months post op vaginoplasty. I lost most of my depth around the two months mark. The vaginal cavity before the second surgery was only 3.5 cm deep and the width of a finger. Dilation under anesthesia done in Boston by Dr. Kent

<p>
But who is Dr Kent?
