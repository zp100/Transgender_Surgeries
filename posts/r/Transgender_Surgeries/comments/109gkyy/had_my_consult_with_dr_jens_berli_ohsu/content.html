Obviously I can&#39;t speak to outcomes yet, but I was really happy with the experience so far. All his staff, from the receptionists to the physician assistant, were wonderful. I was early in the day and had very little wait aside from the time I was early. It started with the PA taking me back, doing vitals, and asking me about my goals. (Specifically, whether it&#39;s more for how I see myself or whether it&#39;s more about other people gendering me correctly. Both are valid, but it partially determines approach.) Then she took a bunch of reference pictures from different angles and told Dr. Berli I was ready.
</p>
<p>
He came in very shortly thereafter with a resident. He talked to me more about what I wanted. I told him I was fairly happy with my brow and hairline, to which he nodded and said that was good because he normally does a fair amount of work to get patients to where I am there, but I really wanted my chin narrowed and made less prominent and my adam&#39;s apple shaved down. I also said my nose makes me uncomfortable but I couldn&#39;t quite figure out what about it.
</p>
<p>
He showed me a PowerPoint presentation with an explanation of the various surgeries he does and some before/after pictures. Because he works for a major public hospital he doesn&#39;t have those online, but they were impressive and naturalistic. He explained what he would recommend on my nose (bringing the bridge in, lifting the tip, and then doing a lip lift to balance the changes and have my upper lip&#39;s fullness match my lower&#39;s).
</p>
<p>
He also explained that, with the laryngochondroplasty, he has never had a vocal cord injury and intends to keep that record up, so he&#39;s more conservative than some surgeons. If I wanted a more aggressive approach he&#39;d be happy to refer me to his colleague, an ENT, who specializes in surgery in that part of the body, but I told him I would be happy to have him do it since it would minimize recovery time and I don&#39;t mind it still being sort of visible as long as it was more within normal female range.
</p>
<p>
Once we&#39;d reached that general agreement of the plan, he took some more pictures from different angles and he said that his team would reach out once we had a surgery date. Unfortunately that&#39;s not likely to be for another eight months, on top of the year-long wait to get the consult, but since my insurance is going to cover it I can hardly complain.
</p>
<p>
Mostly just wanted to share what the process for anyone considering Dr. Berli. Like I said, I can&#39;t speak to results yet, but he and his staff are all very personable, professional, and kind, and from what I&#39;ve read elsewhere he&#39;s also skilled, so I&#39;m personally very happy going forward.

I‚Äôm not sure why you had to wait a year for a consult with him. I called back in November and got scheduled with him for a consult in March. A friend of mine had a consult with him in September and has surgery next month. Everything you‚Äôve explained though is great news and I‚Äôm happy to have my consult with him. Just don‚Äôt know why you were given such a long wait period. I hope you‚Äôre able to get in for surgery sooner than 8 months. That timing just seems a little off.

The difference in delay for consult was because he was backed up because of COVID when I originally scheduled and then they added the new surgeon, Dr. Peters, which has freed Berli up to do more FFS. I&#39;m glad to hear the wait has improved; when I first scheduled (before Dr. Peters was hired) the wait time was closer to 17 months. The surgery time, based on what I heard from the receptionist, varies a
<em>
lot
</em>
. Because it&#39;s considered elective, they take a back seat in scheduling. She said that lately they&#39;ve had waits as short as two months, but it really depends on when the surgery schedulers fit them in. I assume they prefer to tell patients the longer period so we&#39;re less annoyed if it does end up being on the long end.
</p>
<p>
I hope your consult goes just as well!

Ahh okay that makes sense. I forgot that Dr Peters is new. I was wondering why everything has moved so quickly for me. Hopefully you‚Äôre able to have the surgery sooner rather than later. ü§ûüèº

I&#39;ve been on a wait-list for over a year and still have more than 1 year left before even getting my consultation. Are you sure about this?

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m so excited for you, but it is crushing that they are operating like this. Making some people wait over 2 years for a consultation, and some only a few months. I&#39;ve had mostly negative experiences with OHSU, so I guess this shouldn&#39;t be surprising to me.

It‚Äôs not just with OHSU some people are having the same issue with bottom surgery consultations with surgeons. It depends on your letters I‚Äôm assuming, and if you have them all. I have all my letters that I need for bottom, FFS, BA, had all my hair removal. I‚Äôve made sure to be on top of everything before scheduling anything. I got pushed way ahead for my bottom surgery, while others are still waiting. I‚Äôm always calling and trying to communicate and I just know how to get things handled, I‚Äôm not saying you or others don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve just been able to be on top of everything as much as possible, but it also can just be how things are being handled with these hospitals/facilities unfortunately.

Most people have to wait way more than one year. Some patients with some insurance companies seem to skip the line somewhat.

I am speaking English @EmmaLake.  I‚Äôve been on the wait list for 3 years to have my consult appointment with Dr. Berli.  You‚Äôll see that several comments here talk about a short wait list but it‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been for me.
