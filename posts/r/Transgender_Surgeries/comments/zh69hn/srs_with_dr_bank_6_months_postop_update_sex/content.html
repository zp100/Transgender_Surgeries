<p>
Hey all! My last post was written right before things really started to feel settled for me (around the 5 month postop mark), so I thought I&#39;d make an update, since things are going a lot better now. I wouldn&#39;t say a ton has changed physically, but my mindset really has.
</p>
<p>
As always, feel free to ask any questions in the comments!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Aesthetics
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not much to say here, not much has changed. I still plan on getting a revision for the same things I discussed in my last post. My scars have continued to fade, which is nice.
</p>
<p>
That said, I think my attitude towards the aesthetic result has changed a bit? Before surgery, I spent an ungodly amount of time researching every little difference between neo and natal vaginas, and which surgeon would give me the absolute closest-to-natal result. I think this was useful in choosing a surgeon (incredibly grateful I saw Dr. Bank), but it outgrew its usefulness in the early months of recovery, when overanalyzing my result could no longer provide an actual benefit (the decision was already made, and it was too early to inquire about revisions). I felt like my surgery was an &#34;unfinished&#34; project, I guess. Now, while I&#39;m still planning on a revision, I&#39;m still able to be really happy with where things are now. If for whatever reason, I couldn&#39;t get a revision, I think I could live the rest of my life happily and not really think about it. It&#39;s more of a want vs. a need now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Dilation
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I reduced to one dilation a day around the 6-month mark, and so far it&#39;s been more or less fine, and I think a less drastic change in difficulty than moving from 3 to 2 dilations a day at the 3-month mark. I think dilating daily will always feel like a burden, but this most recent change has contributed to the overall feeling of having my life back, and being able to move on from this surgery and recovery process. I still have 7.5 inches of depth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Sex (PiV)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
So since my last post, I&#39;ve gone out and done some hoeing, which I think has also contributed to feeling like I&#39;m &#34;getting past&#34; the bulk of the recovery phase. Sex was the main area of my life where dysphoria was a hindrance before surgery (I was a virgin), and is probably where I&#39;ve seen the biggest improvement from surgery.
</p>
<p>
Mechanically, things work really well. Sex is less painful than dilation, surprisingly, even if the guy is bigger than my largest dilator. I&#39;ve never used lube for sex (maybe it would be better if I did), but things work. I&#39;m always still a little surprised when a guy manages to fit in me, but everyone has so far. Again, super happy with Dr. Bank&#39;s work on the vaginal canal, genuinely no complaints there.
</p>
<p>
From the guys I&#39;ve slept with and disclosed to, I&#39;ve heard that it feels similar/indistinguishable to a natal vagina. One guy told me that I shouldn&#39;t have disclosed to him, because knowing &#34;made him uncomfortable, and he wouldn&#39;t have been able to tell&#34; (not the best way of wording it lol, but also made it sound unlikely that he was just telling me what I wanted to hear). I&#39;m still kind of surprised whenever I get that feedback since the differences are pretty obvious to me, but I guess they aren&#39;t to men.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Stealth Sex
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I thought I&#39;d make a separate category on this, since I feel like it isn&#39;t super talked about. This isn&#39;t really about the morality of whether someone
<em>
should
</em>
disclose. Obviously, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s morally required, but it&#39;s fine if you do. I could be wrong, I&#39;m not a moral authority, just a 19-year-old girl in university lol. This is more educational, and whether or not it&#39;s possible to have sex with a neovagina without getting clocked from it. Also, this is with men, women might be different.
</p>
<p>
So, in my experience, yes it is possible (surprisingly). I&#39;ve done it twice now (both one-time things). I hadn&#39;t intended to have stealth sex until at least 6 months out, but it just happened at 5 months. Finding out it was an option was really cool though, and it was really nice to feel like I could go out, have fun, and do what any cis girl can do. I think men are a lot less perceptive than we think, especially in a dark room and if you pass overall. As a caveat, whenever I&#39;ve had stealth sex I&#39;ve always done something to make the scars less obvious, like growing out my pubic hair or using a little concealer if I&#39;m clean-shaven. Don&#39;t know if that was necessary, but for me, it&#39;s not worth the risk of finding out. I&#39;m also sure the scars will continue to get less visible with time.
</p>
<p>
A few more caveats: I think having my labia in the &#34;right spot&#34; (labia minora going around the vaginal entrance) probably helps, since it makes it pretty obvious for guys where they should stick their dick. I imagine anything that would take a guy out of the moment to closely look at your vulva could risk you getting clocked. I also haven&#39;t happened to have a guy go down on me during a stealth hookup, and I plan on avoiding that for the time being.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Semi-unrelated, but some &#34;big sister&#34; advice, especially for other young trans girls
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I see a lot of young girls on here (or even tiktok/social media influencers) rushing into SRS with the first surgeon available. I almost did this too, because when you&#39;re 17 or 18, it feels urgent. That said, I&#39;m so, so incredibly grateful that I slowed down, did excessive amounts of research, and didn&#39;t go with the surgeon who would see me the quickest or for free (I&#39;m Canadian, and that was an option). When I first brought up wanting SRS to the doctors that oversaw my transition, they basically did all the legwork, got funding approved, and sent me over to a clinic without ever getting me to put in a critical thought about if or with whom I wanted to get surgery. By the time I started really researching different options, I was maybe a few months away from being on the operating table with that clinic, when I would&#39;ve been freshly turned 18.
</p>
<p>
Transitioning is a marathon and not a sprint, but even at 17 when I was 3-4 years into my transition already, I felt this need to rush into surgery with the first option. Looking back, that would&#39;ve been a serious mistake, and looking at some prominent trans influencers, a somewhat common mistake (both because I ended up choosing a different surgeon, but more generally, because it&#39;s super important to know the details of this surgery, especially if you&#39;re young).
</p>
<p>
A lot of people say that this surgery is worth it even if it&#39;s &#34;botched&#34;, if they can&#39;t have sex with it, if the aesthetic result is poor, or even if they can&#39;t orgasm. That wasn&#39;t true for me, and if you&#39;re young, you probably shouldn&#39;t assume it&#39;s true for you either (I don&#39;t think we have enough life experience to say stuff like that). You&#39;re going to live with this for so, so many years. I know that I wouldn&#39;t be happy with my decision to have surgery if it wasn&#39;t functional or didn&#39;t resemble a natal vulva.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I give this advice in comments, I try to be nice, but I&#39;m not going try as hard here, because it&#39;s really important and not directed at any one person. Also, SRS recovery isn&#39;t nice. This is targeted at young people (including myself from the past, I got surgery when I was 18, and this is based on my own experiences).
<strong>
Don&#39;t get SRS if you haven&#39;t considered other surgeons. Don&#39;t get SRS because it&#39;s available or free. Don&#39;t get SRS if you haven&#39;t spent considerable time online, on this subreddit or wiki, looking at ALL of your options. Don&#39;t lie to yourself that you&#39;d be happy with results you wouldn&#39;t be happy with. Don&#39;t get SRS if you won&#39;t be able to maintain the aftercare. Don&#39;t get SRS if you don&#39;t know the details of the surgical technique (looking at intraoperative photos might be hard, but so is SRS). Don&#39;t get SRS if you&#39;re not researching because &#34;it&#39;ll make you more anxious&#34; (If this is the case, you might not be going to the right surgeon. Knowing the exact details of the surgery actually alleviated my anxiety when I was researching a surgeon I was confident in).  Don&#39;t get SRS because you&#39;re already on a waitlist, and switching surgeons will prolong the wait. Don&#39;t get SRS if you think that your result will be indistinguishable from a natal vulva and vagina.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
As young people, we need to be extra careful that our sense of urgency or ignorance isn&#39;t influencing our decision to have surgery, or who to have it with. As someone who&#39;s now 19 and somewhat recently postop, having had to live an extra year of my life preop really wasn&#39;t a big deal. Unlike other surgeries, SRS really only impacts your sex life (besides certain clothing choices), so of all the surgeries to delay, it&#39;ll probably have one of the lesser impacts. Also,
<em>
because
</em>
SRS mainly only impacts your sex life, it would probably be even more devastating if it wasn&#39;t sexually functional. Slow down, research carefully, and make the best decision possible.

I’ve had stealth sex and I’m also banksy  (9 months post-op) though I would never let a guy inspect it, i have no scar and no asymmetry and have one of the cleanest results according to bank with zero complication, but my anterior is different than of the cis women and not to mention the whole urethra positioning and chon organs is totally give away, I know most of guys don’t know shit about it. But guys who have a passion for pussies would most probably notice the difference ( I know these types of guys). Revision would make it much better but it will never look 100 percent cis. That’s for sure.

Yeah, no SRS surgeon can give you a fully indistinguishable result sadly. That said, I&#39;m pretty happy with what I have given the limitations of the surgery.
</p>
<p>
And definitely, it&#39;s important to be careful with stealth sex.

Thank you so much for the write up! And very wise words about the process. I&#39;m having my surgery with Banks in 2 months from now, and I&#39;m very excited.  If you don&#39;t mind me asking, how do you feel about the size of your labia majoras? I feel like he has a tendency to go a little large on these - and do you have the impression that he&#39;s open to discussing it, and or potential concerns, or should I just let him do his thing? Also I have noticed a huge variance in whether or not the vagina &#39;gapes&#39; a bit for different people. Do you have experience with that? I imagine that it can be addressed in revision anyhow.

Thank you!
</p>
<p>
So I personally didn’t ask for anything specific, and I don’t know if I’d change anything besides what I want to get revised. I think my majora are pretty okay in terms of size (I don’t have a bulge or anything), but I’m also pretty skinny.
</p>
<p>
My policy for primary was basically “let Bank do his thing, and I can get anything revised later”. That said, Bank seems more open to requests for primary than Suporn was.
</p>
<p>
Edit: I forgot to mention gaping. I think this both depends on the amount of donor material you have and if you get the commissures revised (which I plan on doing).

“Men are less perceptive than we think” YES YES YES

Men would stick their dick in a warm fruit in the dark and ask why you’re so wet. Perception: 2%

Ladies, go stealth. These dudes have no idea what’s going on. Relax and have fun! The only one worried about details is you. Don’t let it ruin your life with anxiety.

On the other side when I was young and preop bitd (late 1990s-early 2000s) I used to go to clubs with other cis girls.  I always told the guys before, and never got turned down.  I think only the hardcore far right types care much anymore.   You just have to have good observation skills.

Yeah, it&#39;s weird sometimes. I think very few people have the black and white &#34;&#34;preferences&#34;&#34; that people talk about online or debate about. To be completely honest, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve been with a guy who didn&#39;t seem at least a little uncomfortable with me being trans, at least at first. A lot of people have a lot of predetermined notions, sadly.
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of people don&#39;t recommend this, but I&#39;ve always had more success letting them get to know me as a person before coming out.

Edit to your reply: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not a viable option, I heavily considered them, it just wasn&#39;t the option I chose.
</p>
<p>
Second edit: I also don&#39;t mean to imply that everyone should go to Dr. Bank! Just that everyone should carefully browse the wiki and make an informed choice, whatever it is. Realistic expectations are important no matter who you go to.
</p>
<p>
I go into it a bit in some of my previous updates, but my honest answer:
</p>
<p>
(This doesn&#39;t mean I think they do bad work or that people can&#39;t be happy with their results from them, just my personal reasons. Part of what I was getting at with the last segment is that I think young people should put more emphasis on making a &#34;perfect&#34; choice rather than a &#34;good&#34; choice, since we don&#39;t know how we&#39;ll feel in the future, and might put more emphasis on factors like wait times and money than we should. Basically, the surgical result is the most &#34;permanent&#34; outcome of surgery, as compared to wait times and money.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Their construction of the vulva, especially ending the labia minora above the introitus wasn&#39;t something I would&#39;ve been happy with. Also, getting noticeable labia minora at all can be a bit hit or miss from them. I thought Dr. Bank would give me a more passable result.
<ul>
<li>
The revisions the Suporn Clinic offers are also a part of this, I&#39;ve basically always considered this to be a 2 stage surgery. To my knowledge, GRS Montreal will do some reconstructive, shorter revisions (similar to what I had when I was in Thailand for primary), but not 2-hour revisions that construct features like the commissures. IMO, most neovulvas could benefit from an anterior commissure revision, and in older 2-stage surgeries, this was standard.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
They leave a bit more scarring (on par with most surgeons though), especially since the tension put on the vulva from penile inversion leads to dehiscence pretty frequently.
</li>
<li>
I was put on puberty blockers somewhat young, and the Suporn Clinic is generally one of the best clinics for limited donor material for both aesthetics and depth.
</li>
<li>
I liked the chonburi organ.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something, it was a super complex decision. That said, I think I made the right choice for myself, and I don&#39;t regret anything.

Loooove love love your bolded parts. Yes those are all real and valid.
</p>
<p>
Some people get srs in the wrong state of mind and go to any surgeon………then end up like shape shifter, who is a loud detransitioner because of her botched srs.
</p>
<p>
She didnt get the results wanted became disabled because of it and it broke her mind.
</p>
<p>
Now shes a……raging detransitioner who is building a following. So much she helped florida change laws making it impossible for trans kids and you g adults access gender affirming care or treatment…..
</p>
<p>
This is that cunts reality now…..and she is hell bent on spreading her control to other states! Murica

According to the clinic, the scrotal skin lining is estrogen sensitive and that’s how they explain the lubrication. I don’t know the mechanics, but I do know a good amount of Suporn Clinic patients who anecdotally report being able to lubricate.
</p>
<p>
My vagina is never dry, but I also get noticeably wetter when I’m turned on. I also doubt this is “precum”, since I didn’t produce any before.

No, it&#39;s just a feature of the tissue (according to the clinic). I&#39;ve never had another type of vagina (penile inversion or peritoneal pull-through), so I can&#39;t compare. I&#39;d considered getting PPT before surgery, but I don&#39;t regret my choice, I think my vaginal lining functions decently enough.
