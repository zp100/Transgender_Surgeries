I&#39;m in Alberta, Canada and have applied for PI vaginoplasty through GRS Montreal. I&#39;m 330 lbs and 5&#39;11.
</p>
<p>
A few questions and concerns I have as a plus size trans woman:
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m at a 46 BMI. I know they want me below 40 for sure and prefer even under 30. Has anyone above those values had vaginoplasty? Would they postpone me until I&#39;m under that BMI?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also concerned about having limited donor material, and haven&#39;t read about anyone using grafting with vaginoplasty at GRS Montreal.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also very curious because I have a very large FUPA. Would they remove that? I know that even with weight loss, it&#39;s a very difficult area to lose body fat from. Could they use some of that material?
</p>
<p>
Would it be better to save up for a BBL and Liposuction to lose a majority of the weight surgically and do the rest of it with diet and exercise?
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t seen many plus size trans women with vaginoplasty on here and I&#39;m kind of concerned about that.
</p>
<p>
Also is PI the best route for me or should I look into another method?
</p>
<p>
Thanks in advance!

I can‚Äôt comment at all about the BMI aspect of it but please reconsider GRS Montreal, I‚Äôm looking into surgery too and I originally looked into GRS Montreal because Brassard can work with Michigan insurance but I have heard a lot of bad things about GRS Montreal, they make all patients sign an NDA which is a giant red flag. You can‚Äôt even find result pictures on their website if I remember correctly. Brassard also advertises his surgery as a one step surgery which I guess technically it is but that because he only creates the vaginal cavity, clitoris etc, he doesn‚Äôt do anything as far as the external aesthetics go so you have to go back for a revision at some point when you are healed enough down the line. Also again a surgery that usually takes most surgeons 4-6 hours he claims to do in 1-2, you can‚Äôt in my opinion cut the surgery time down that much without taking some shortcuts

The thing is that I&#39;m a Canadian, specifically Albertan, so that&#39;s the only surgical site that will be covered under my provincial health care. There&#39;s no fee besides my flight and a few other costs. But I can&#39;t afford vaginoplasty otherwise. It&#39;s just not in my budget or borrowing capability.

Yeah I understand that, it‚Äôs a tough world for people like us who just want to feel at home in their body, well I wish you the best of luck! I‚Äôve know a couple girls that had it done with Brassard and they are happy with their results, so I will hope for you that it goes smoothly and you get similar satisfaction with the outcome!

YOU should want to loose that weight before going into surgery. Having a higher BMI puts you at risk for a lot of complications and potentially having a much longer recovery. Wound dehenisence is a big one as the weight pulls at the sutures. Personally, it‚Äôs not a risk I would take.
</p>
<p>
As you suggested, BBL might be the way to go as you can loose the weight and have it redistributed at the same time. Even still, with BBL, they recommend you hit your target weight and then get it.
</p>
<p>
My honest recommendation, focus on bringing your BMI down before any surgery. It‚Äôll be worth it in the long run.

Oh I&#39;m definitely focused on losing the weight. I&#39;m down 20 lbs already from 350. Gotta keep on going!

I had GRS with Brassard two months ago, at a 37ish BMI. Between 35 and 40, they basically want you to do a sleep apnea screening (depending on a few other risk factors ‚Äî this turned out to be good for me, because I didn‚Äôt know I had it!) and then will do a tiny bit of extra monitoring during early recovery (just someone coming and checking your vitals a couple times a day, not sure how often they did that for other people). No negative experiences with them about weight at all, nobody yelled at me or anything about it (other than my sleep apnea doc was a little shitty but she‚Äôs unrelated to them). They also didn‚Äôt do a ‚Äúweigh-in‚Äù or anything, they had a weight on the referral form from my doctor and then just asked ‚Äúso are you about the same weight?‚Äù day of. (My recovery is going well ‚Äî I think it‚Äôs a very slight elevation in risk, it‚Äôs a totally arbitrary threshold to say ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs an okay risk for THESE people and not for THOSE ones.)
</p>
<p>
They do say in the documents that they won‚Äôt operate above 40. I wasn‚Äôt / am not, so don‚Äôt know how that works there.
</p>
<p>
In terms of ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù: nobody looked at what I was ‚Äúworking with‚Äù until the meeting with Brassard the morning of, when he said he thought it‚Äôd be enough but asked whether I wanted him to do a skin graft if it wasn‚Äôt. We talked briefly about consequences of that, I said yes, but then it was enough so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I&#39;m 6&#39;3&#34; 280 lbs , 300 lbs at my consult.  Mine was for mayo in Minnesota but they ideally wanted my bmi of 38 to be between 25-30 but said insurance would let me proceed if I was under 35. I know for myself personally they said they had enough material to work with but if they didn&#39;t the more weight I could lose would give them more to work with in the form of skin grafts.  Due to the atrophy of my hrt for 8+ years they are proceeding with a PIV hybrid procedure.

GRS Montreal has some strict rules in place. A BMI 35-40 will need additional testing (looking at things such as obstructive sleep apnea). Over 40 and they won&#39;t do surgery.
</p>
<p>
PI (and zero depth) is the only method currently used at GRS Montreal. If it helps, I&#39;ve known people with very &#34;limited material&#34; get good depth.

I was right on the dot at 35 BMI when I went into surgery.  6&#39;2&#34; 260lbs.   I posted my results a few days back if you look at my post history.
</p>
<p>
I also had a PI.
</p>
<p>
I was about 400lbs 2 years ago,and lost about 140 so I could qualify for surgery.
</p>
<p>
I honestly am extremely happy with my results. üòÅ   and FUPAs are awesome. I wouldn&#39;t worry a about that
