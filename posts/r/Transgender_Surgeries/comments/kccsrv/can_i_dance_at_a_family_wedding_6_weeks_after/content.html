Title mostly covers it, but I have bottom surgery (peritoneal pull through) scheduled for late next year, and it&#39;s 6 weeks before my sister&#39;s wedding. I&#39;m hoping I will be able to dance with everyone there, but I&#39;m worried that it&#39;s too soon into recovery and that I&#39;m going to have to take it easy.
</p>
<p>
What have your experiences been with recovery for bottom surgery, and in particular peritoneal pull through if that&#39;s what you got? My surgeon is Wittenberg if that makes any difference.

Are you speaking from experience? Did you have the same kind of bottom surgery?

I had surgery, don&#39;t think it was exactly the same, butvi could easily have dancing by week 3 or 4. I have also have a nephrectomy and ureter reconstruction, both of these were worse than srs and i could dance by week 6.

Given the what I know from people I know who&#39;ve had PPT, I would not plan on it. For me I just had penile inversion and I was just happy to be able to stand up and walk down the aisle at my relative&#39;s  wedding, and sit for the rest. Felt like poo the next day, and I didn&#39;t have incisions in my belly.
</p>
<p>
Do what your doctors tell you to do, don&#39;t do what your doctors tell you not to do. Not all doctors are the same.
</p>
<p>
I was not cleared to do whatever I felt comfortable doing until 5 months, fwiw. I&#39;ve taken my sweet time getting back to &#34;normal&#34; and it&#39;s gone very well for me thus far.

You might be able to a little. But I wouldn&#39;t plan on doing a lot of anything for the first 6-8 weeks. You won&#39;t be in pain but you&#39;ll run out of energy quickly. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll go regardless, but I&#39;d say take it easy and limit the alcohol to like one drink.
</p>
<p>
I was doing housework in stages for like the first 2 months. I was able to walk about a mile at a time but that was it.

Had an easier surgery (zero depth) and I would say fuck no at 6 weeks. I&#39;m at 8 weeks now and still pretty grumpy at the end of the day. Any kind of wedding would have been way too much for me.
</p>
<p>
Everyone&#39;s different though so maybe you&#39;ll be ok, you should prepare for not being ok though.

I wouldn’t count on it tbh. I was still in n a 10lb push/pull/lift restriction at that point. Walking was hard enough, sitting was uncomfortable at best. I certainly wasn’t shaking my hips at 6 wks, after PPT SRS.

I&#39;m 5 weeks out from PPT and I would not go to a wedding because of all the sitting. I could probably dance for 10 minutes, but it would be absolutely exhausting.  I still avoid sitting in a chair... Basically been laying in bed dilating since surgery

I had PI so different procedure but that said. I was in the gym at four weeks. I had the ok to go back to work at full duty as a field arborist at six weeks. Sitting my or may not be an issue, I was mostly ok at four weeks with that.

In my case, I&#39;m at 6.5 weeks of recovery from peritoneal pull through with Wittenberg and there&#39;s no way I could dance.  The abdominal incisions have been surprisingly non-painful but everything else is sore and I run out of energy in 10-20 mins just from slowly walking around.  I feel a lot of my pain is caused by the &#34;3 week&#34; dissolving sutures still being barely dissolved.  If you&#39;ve had previous surgery where the sutures dissolved on time, your chances of being
<em>
able
</em>
to dance at 6 weeks are improved, but having the energy to do it for long is unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Wittenberg&#39;s official policy is no strenuous activity for 12 weeks.  So any strenuous or extended dancing may prolong your total recovery time, cause painful wound separation that takes weeks to heal, trigger swelling that may reduce the definition of labia minora, etc.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://mygenderconfirmation.wordpress.com/blog-2/" rel="nofollow">https://mygenderconfirmation.wordpress.com/blog-2/
</a>
talks about their healing being faster than average.  They mention being able to walk a few blocks, vacuum, drive a little, and go to the grocery store at six weeks but also say they run out of energy quickly.
</p>
<p>
If you want details of my recovery, see

Thanks for the tip and linking to for write-up! I&#39;ve actually already rescheduled the surgery for after the wedding.

Yeah I will second what others have said here. I had ppt almost 6 months ago at this point. It really wasn&#39;t until around month 3 that I was able to start being more mobile and sitting was finally starting to get more comfortable. I don&#39;t think I would have felt good enough for dancing until months 4-5. Where I am now though I definitely could. Early on the abdominal incisions were particularly painful. And if there are any issues that come up that would delay recovery as well. Having said all that you could probably still attend, you just want to have your donut cushion with you and listen to your body, and be able to duck out early if you need to.
