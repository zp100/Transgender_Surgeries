If you ask me, a big loss. I know there have been critical voices about him here as well. But he gave me a new attitude towards life. I had my FFS with him in September 2019. I wish his family, loved ones and the whole clinic heartfelt condolences.

He had a polarizing reputation, but the girls that loved his work seemed to LOVE it. I was considering a consult with him and it’s weird that just… won’t happen now.

I just looked at some of your pics and, holy cow... I‘m beyond envious right now 😅 (I know that’s a backhanded compliment, sorry. What I mean to say is you’re incredibly gorgeous!) And all the more sad he passed away as I can see he did amazing work.

A loss to the community and to his family.
</p>
<p>
I will politely suggest that his typical &#34;haters&#34; don&#39;t flood this thread with nastiness.  Save it for another time, eh?
</p>
<p>
We don&#39;t have many allies in the medical world, but Dr Bart was definitely one.

I respect your comment. But too much to say bart van de ven was an &#34;ally&#34; to the trans community. If I&#39;ve studied well of him , he &#34;deliberately&#34; botched the non-Europeans +including UK patients), and &#34;careful &#34; abd pleasing to mainland Europeans. .y comment may round awful, but ve careful and vigilant to the statistics - it can&#39;t be more true my reckoning.
</p>
<p>
So, please NO to RIP.

I want to. Ake clear, and can&#39;t talk for everyone, but reiterating myself: I&#39;m or no-one is rejoicing death if bart van de ven. I&#39;m not just not been botched and made partially blind by him, but I faced acute racism by him and his team just moment I opened eyes post my surgery. So, people who&#39;s not in a position of having to go through these, i urge to STOP bring judgemental on those who&#39;ve faced brunt and ruined life- permanently by him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still not sorry&#39; about anything. Karma never leaves anyone- noone !!

Anybody celebrating the death of somebody else is a vile human being.  If you know a few of them, it&#39;s perhaps time to pick some better friends.

There is a service called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ucqeo/virtual_ffs_experiences/e93gg97/" rel="nofollow">virtualFFS
</a>
and consulting them in case may be a good idea. They also know surgeons. It may be necessary to discuss with them the kind of approach though. A standard may be a moderate approach. Be aware that with a more aggressive approach results can look more mask like, and less individual.
</p>
<p>
They could make a few suggestions including a minimal one. More details are

Well I didn&#39;t see any proof of him dead. He kinda just disappeared and his clinic is still running like nothing happened. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he faked his death and changed his name and went into hiding managing his clinic from his room. 🤷‍♀️
