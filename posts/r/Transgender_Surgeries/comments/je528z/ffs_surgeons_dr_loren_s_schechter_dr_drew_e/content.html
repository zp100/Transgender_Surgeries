My insurance covers these surgeons, but I can&#39;t find a lot of information about them online. Does anyone know anything about them? Dr. Gabriel Del Corral&#39;s website is pretty transphobic, so I&#39;m probably going to avoid him

Ah yeah, idk I was skeptical of Del Corral because he just does everything and doesn’t seem to specialize in any one thing. For the language, which is transphobic, I think it’s likely due to maybe a language barrier as I think his native language is Spanish. Still though, not professional and since he does lots of gender affirming surgeries, it should be updated to not insult his clients

I reached out to him a week ago so he shouldn&#39;t have been surprised to hear from you; as of yesterday it was still up, but it looks like it has finally been fixed.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re happy with your results, can you say any more about the process? What you had done?

He won&#39;t show ffs pictures until you pay for a ct scan. Sounds totally normal and not scammy at all.

Look in the wiki here, and also in the SRS section.

I&#39;m not looking at them for SRS. The only one mentioned in the wiki is Schechter, and it&#39;s someone who had a bad consult for him for phalloplasty

I think it’s helpful to look t the bigger picture when choosing a surgeon. There’s plenty on Schecter.

I told him about it and he said he would get it fixed, so it may not be there anymore
