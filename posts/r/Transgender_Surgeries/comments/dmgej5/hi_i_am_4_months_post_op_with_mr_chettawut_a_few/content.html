No photos because no thanks.
</p>
<p>
I posted here a lot a few months back, before and during the first two months post OP, but haven&#39;t posted anything in quite a while. So I figured I would update people here. You can check my submitted threads in my profile to know my journey so far.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The good
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
Healing has been super smooth. Yeah, I felt a lot of pain and discomfort but right now I only feel soreness when I cross my legs or when I am biking. I can walk fine, sit fine, jog, squat, jump around, etc. It is awesome. Looks-wise, I feel like it looks okay but a cis woman could see the difference IF she knows SRS is a thing, otherwise they would just think of the different look as something natural. However, from what I read there are still changes in how it looks up to over a year so who knows, maybe I will like it better eventually. Right now I am trying to get back with the love of my life and she knows I am trans, so if that works out (wish me luck, please) how my vulva looks won&#39;t be a concern.
</p>
<p>
It is fun not having to take anti androgens every day, and I don&#39;t take high levels of estradiol because it is not necessary. It is also easier on my funds.
</p>
<p>
But I think the best thing is the weight it took off my shoulders. I have grown so much as a person since my trip to Thailand back in June. I am a bolder, more talkative, happier. I can&#39;t stand staying home even though one year ago I didn&#39;t want to leave my room, let alone the house. I am free. I am not scared of someone touching me and finding a dick. I am not scared of going into women&#39;s places. Etc. It is fucking awesome. My birthday was 4 days ago and honestly this next year will be fucking awesome. I will come back to tell you how awesome it was in October 2020 :)
</p>
<p>
Another good thing is how much my body hair thinned. I was pretty much an ape but now I only have hair in my legs, naturally, arms (but very thin and they grow slowly).
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The bad:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
By now I have lost significant depth because I am SO busy and can&#39;t deal with the dilation schedule. If you check my post history you will see that dilation takes far too long for me and that has never changed. Honestly, I am truly considering stopping it altogether but I HATE giving up. I had 6 inches originally and now I have something between 4.5 and 5. It is okay because I am a lesbian and I truly believe I am getting back with my boo so whatever, but I wish I could dilate better. Sometimes penetrating myself with the dilator feels... Good. Like, the clitoral area heats up, which is such a new thing to me. Does anyone else feel that? I will miss that if I lose all of my depth :(
</p>
<p>
There IS some hair in the vaginal canal entrance which is annoying. Thankfully, there is nothing inside so I can deal with the hair later on, but still.
</p>
<p>
Also, FUCK IT TAKES SO LONG TO LOSE WEIGHT NOW. I could fast two days and lose like 2kg but now I lose like nothing.
</p>
<p>
Ask me anything! :) Cheers, luvs.

Nice!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been wondering about timelines on how long it takes to get back to peak activity. Like, how long did it take you to be able to handle an 8-hour or 12-hour workday on your feet, etc?
</p>
<p>
At this point im pretty sure ill be out of commission for 3 months but id rather be sure before I communicate that to my work. What has your experience been like?
</p>
<p>
Oh and you said you biked, how long did it take before you were willing to try that?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a pretty active person myself, and being tied down for ages is my biggest worry surrounding surgery.

To be fair, I don&#39;t work on my feet. But I do working sitting and it took me nearly 3 months to be able to sit. It was uncomfortable at first, for like 2~3 minutes, then the discomfort would go away for the most part. Now I can sit just fine. I still feel some pressure on my clitoral area sometimes but it is not even pain.
</p>
<p>
I think if you make sure to walk around your room for like 10~15 minutes a day one week after surgery or so, it will help you build strength to go back to work after 3 months. I just laid down on bed for months so it took me a while getting used to walking a lot, standing up, etc.
</p>
<p>
I tried biking... three weeks ago. I made sure to wait until 3 months at least to try such activities. Chett&#39;s staff told me to not work out until 4 months so keep that in mind. I am going to start gym activities next week, so I might send another update here if interested.
</p>
<p>
I can imagine. I was not very active before but now my life is crazy enough that I can&#39;t even dilate every day. And I am loving it.

Gotcha, it sounds like I might be SOL for longer then I had initially planned. I think I&#39;ll try to save an extra month or 2&#39;s worth of bill money just in case I need to take that time off.
</p>
<p>
I do have options if I need to take an inactive status at work, but I can&#39;t say the thought of moving in with my parents for a while is appetizing. In any case, I&#39;m getting this surgery eventually, just gotta work out the kinks in planning!

Thanks for your update. I’m 5 weeks post op with Dr Chettawut so still sore but feel I’m recovering quickly. It’s comforting to read what to expect in the next few months (of course my mileage may vary). Ditto inserting the dilator sometimes, unexpected... good as you stated. And ditto with the confidence too. For me it’s finally shaking that “imposter syndrome” feeling for good; it was almost an immediate change. Congrats on your recovery, looking forward if you post more updates in the coming months and years.

Yeah, pretty much. Imposter syndrome has become a thing of the past for me :) I will try to update whenever I can. Do let me know if you need anything or have any questions, I don&#39;t visit here everyday but I am not going to disappear :)

Chet said that the urethra ends up lower because he removes all the erectile tissue, sounded like it&#39;s sort of a trade-off.

That sounds like bs. Other surgeons remove &#34;all&#34; the erectile tissue and dont have this problem.

Well that&#39;s what he said when asked about it and it makes sense. What other surgeons do the same technique as Chet and remove all the erectile tissue? Peeing isn&#39;t an universal problem of his patients.

My pee flows just fine, but it depends on a few things. In the morning sometimes it spreads a little over the place but most of the time it flows just fine, really. I haven&#39;t tried to locate my urethra yet but tbh I don&#39;t want to worry about this stuff now. Also, my cis cousin says pee spreading all over the place happens to her as well.

Normally the urethra is close to the vaginal canal and not it the clit so cos women do tend to &#39;pee everywhere.&#39;

Hm, honestly, if you REALLY value your depth you might want to not travel during the first six months, at least. Like I said, I am on my fourth month and dilation has been super difficult because I can&#39;t dilate more than once a day, sometimes once every two days. It is a pain but I can&#39;t stop my life because of dilation.

After one year you can dilate once or twice a week, I think. It still is a pain but you would have to carry one or two dilators with you at most, and some lube.

Did you get electro?
</p>
<p>
I am trying to decide if I want to see Chett this summer, or if I want to get a year of electro and see him next Spring instead. It&#39;s such a tough decision!

I did not. I do have some hair in the vaginal entrance (not in the canal, way before it) which can be dealt with later (though it is a pain to shave it, and plucking hurts a fair bit). I didn&#39;t get it because it was too expensive and I didn&#39;t want to wait regardless. I got lucky, though.

I understand the anxiety but if you can afford electro, perhaps it is better to play it safe.

Thanks for the info. It seems like generally the reports of internal hair are in the entrance or just inside, which is manageable.

I don&#39;t want to have to wait the extra year to get electro done and I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s not that big of a problem.

Problems may arise, yeah, but I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about it. You can keep it safe and still have problems, or be somewhat reckless like me and have none (my problems are more related to the appearance of my vulva than anything related to complications).

It does seem very YMMV, like all things that we go through. :)

Ultimately I&#39;d much rather have a pussy w a few hairs in it than a dick!!
