Presumably this company.

New company, incorporated in 2018, surgeons not named in their site as far as I can tell. No reviews of there SRS. Incredibly risky.
</p>
<p>
I did find one review mentioning them, about a fat transfer
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So, I originally posted this on badge clinic as that&#39;s another clinic Dr Burak Ersoy works with and couldn&#39;t find reviews on Asproatlantic.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery on the 6th November 2019 with Dr Burak Ersoy through asproatlantic. I am disappointed in both the clinic and Doctor, but since asproatlantic threatened me I&#39;ll keep this to a review of Burak.
</p>
<p>
I should have been a simple case as was already slim just with some stubborn areas of fat, no loose skin. I&#39;ve ended up with uneven lipo on my sides. Doctors I&#39;ve consulted since have said he has taken too much fat from the middle of my waist then left fat at the bottom and top of my waist. This has left me with fibrosis, painful internal scar tissue and a waist that looks lumpy/uneven.
</p>
<p>
I am seeking a revision with a different Doctor who wants my post op report. I&#39;ve asked Dr Burak for it countless times and he still hasn&#39;t sent me it. He has now blocked me on WhatsApp and is ignoring my messages on Instagram. This is very disappointing and unprofessional behaviour.
</p>
<p>
I still massage every day but it hasn&#39;t improved things.
</p>
<p>
I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend Dr Burak Ersoy for liposuction particularly if you&#39;re slim.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: after receiving, shall we say, unwelcome messages on WhatsApp from the 2 owners of Asproatlantic (who then swiftly deleted them once they&#39;d seen I&#39;d read them) I thought I&#39;d clarify a couple of things. Dr Burak Ersoy doesn&#39;t work with asproatlantic anymore, but he did when I had my surgery on 6th November 2019. I used asproatlantic for surgery with Dr Burak, so where else am I meant to leave a review. Everyone is entitled to share their experience, be it good or bad. Otherwise what is even the point of having review sites...
