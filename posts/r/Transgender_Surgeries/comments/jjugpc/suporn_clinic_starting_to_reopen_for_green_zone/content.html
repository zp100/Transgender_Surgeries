I found a partial list of green zone countries in a random Thai news article. It includes: Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand and Australia.

This
<em>
is
</em>
fantastic news! As the shutdown has dragged on, I&#39;ve been increasingly worried that the Suporn Clinic wouldn&#39;t have the resources to reopen once the travel bans were lifted. I&#39;m so happy to see them opening their doors again!
</p>
<p>
I know it could easily still be six months or more before US citizens are allowed into Thailand (and for good reason), but I&#39;ll still be right there in line to book a date when the calendar goes back up.

There’s no way they would shut down for good. Surgeons are very well off there and what else would they do once travel restarts? Suporn might since he’s retiring anyway, but no way Bank would stop.

My fear was more that Dr. Suporn would retire, the Clinic would close its doors, and Dr. Bank would move on to either open a new practice or join an established one somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
Of course, it&#39;s entirely possible that it&#39;ll be the Chayamote Clinic anyway by the time I get there! Not that I&#39;d mind, as long as they continue providing the same level of care as they have in the past.

It doesn’t matter if they closed, Bank has some very valuable skills and a personal interest in SRS. He’s not going to stop. Suporn is said to be quite wealthy too,  so I can’t see them shutting it down. He spent his life on it.

<h1>
Reopening after Covid-19 Coronavirus Crisis – Update 27 October 2020
</h1>
<p>
Dear Clients
</p>
<p>
We are excited to announce that we are now in able to start opening up our doors again, and accept clients for surgery. Initially, though, we are limiting the clients that we can accept to those who already had reserved an operation with us when we had to close because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Thailand is opening up for visitors from countries that it considers to be “safe” from Covid-19 ( “Green Zone” ), but is not allowing visitors from countries that still have unacceptably high incidences of Covid-19 ( “Red Zone” ).
</p>
<p>
We are sending out individual email invitations to clients using the same priority on our suspended calendar (our “Priority List”), but can only directly invite clients in Thailand’s “Green Zone”. Those letters will explain the additional procedures that the Thai Government expects you to have completed before and during your visit
</p>
<p>
When we have received responses from those clients, we will then re-assess the schedule, and send further invitations individually as necessary.
</p>
<p>
If you are on the Priority List, but in the ”Red Zone” we will also email you explaining the situation, but as soon as your country moves into the “Green Zone” you will move up the priority list and receive an explicit invitation to come for surgery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
If you already have an operation reserved or provisionally reserved
</strong>
, you need
<strong>
take no action
</strong>
. We will contact you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
If you do not already have an operation booked
</strong>
, please wait until we publish the calendar with free dates before asking for a date. We cannot offer you a date at the moment irrespective of where you live, and will not do so until the calendar is made public again. We don’t know exactly when that will be, but are hopeful we will be able to republish available dates early in the first quarter of 2021.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cosmetic Improvement
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately we are not yet able to accept booking for cosmetic improvement (CI) because the stringent safety regulations do not allow us to perform any surgery in the Clinic itself. However, as previously notified, we have extended your warranty to compensate for the time we have been closed. We anticipate that we may be able to resume early in 2021.
</p>
<p>
Our approach is always to be “Cautious and Safe”, which we understand is frustrating for some – but it is essential. Please bear with us, and remain patient a little longer.
</p>
<p>
Watch this space for further news and meanwhile  ……………….
<strong>
STAY SAFE!
</strong>

While this is great news I’m quite curious how it’s going to work in the near future. Thailand just let a couple tourists from China into the country about a week ago but from what it looks like those tourists are long stay tourists (because they want to control the virus and their borders but still receive tourism revenue)
<br>
Maybe patients will have to stay longer in the country during this time.
