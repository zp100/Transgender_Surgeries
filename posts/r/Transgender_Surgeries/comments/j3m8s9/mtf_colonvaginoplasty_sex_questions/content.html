MTF Post OP sex questions
</p>
<p>
Preface note: I( 21 F/ mtf)had a colon-vaginoplasty in November of 2016 at age 17 in USA, with a great doctor. I’m posting this on my throwaway because I simply live my life on a “ needs to know basis” and don’t want the whole internet to know my business. Thanks for understanding now onto the post...
</p>
<p>
As stated above, I (21 F/mtf) had colon-vaginoplasty in mid November 2016 at 17 in USA, and the initial surgery went well considering how insanely invasive/intense it was. I also had another operation in March of 2018  ( to fix a ring of scar tissue build up around the opening which caused both immense pain during sex/ inability to have PIV sex at all) I fully followed the dilation schedule and was able to have penetrative sex. This should go without saying, but the sex I was able to have definitely took lots of work between myself and then LDR bf(Cis 20 M) who had a slightly under average/ average penis size and by the time we had broken up ( just before technically ) I could fit him all the way in and he could easily finish in me. Cut to now 2020 I have had my now current BF(Cis 23M) and sex for us has also been work and isn’t just super easy as I feel sex is often shown to be /talked about in media /porn. Furthermore, I definitely have noticed this one persistant problem, my SO can’t fit all the way in my vagina, and while he is definitely the biggest in terms of penis size (if I had to guess it would be about 6-7 in with considerable girth- also he’s 6’1 and pretty muscular aka kinda a big guy) I didn’t think it would be so hard as the colon is very long and I have a lot of depth. Additionally, it’s super disheartening and causes me a lot of dysphoria when I feel like I’m somehow lesser than or not a real woman bc my BF can’t fit all the ways in and finish in me. I would like to clarify that while I’m acutely aware of the these negative feelings being my problem/ responsibility to resolve via therapy (which I currently am doing), it still totally sucks as it can ruin the moment. Additionally, I would like to note some sexual and physical medical history before I ask my final question: - I’m also 5’8 and very skinny like my weight range is about 115-120( never really above ) and while I have some curves( thanks to hormones) I think I may have narrow hips which could be a potentially complicating factor in this issue
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I had build up of the colon mucus surgically removed both in may 2017 and recently in August 2020 both minor operations went well
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I have since been advised to use a catheter to douche/ clean my vagina deeply once a month to avoid having to have the minor surgery to remove the mucus build up so much.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
my boyfriend is sometimes able to get considerably far maybe half way ( it feels like more on my end but we both are totally sure since we aren’t fully attentive to this detail while we have sex) , and he has been able to finish in me just once, but then never again sadly.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Therefore, I guess my question(s) are the following: 1. Have any of you who have had the colon-vaginoplasty experienced the inability to have penetrative sex due to colon mucus build up, if so any solutions ?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Have any of you who have had SRS/ colon-vaginoplasty ever experienced difficulty having your Cis male partner/Husband/ boyfriend fit all the way in your vagina?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My BF also claims that while he can sometimes get pretty far depth wise he states that it starts to get tight/raw ( on sides of his dick) when he goes faster in terms of thrust pace , and so it stops him from being able to finish. He also sometimes says he feels like he hits a wall at a certain point ( again very strange since the colon was used to make the vaginal canal and it’s very very long in nature- think like 7-8inches +). Therefore, has anyone had their Cis male sexual partner or SO complain of this, if so how did you both fix this issue?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In closing, if you read all of that, I would like to thank you in advance for sharing your experiences and thoughts on this matter, as when I had searched the web for answers I had found virtually nothing on the topic of post operative sex issues for mtf, and especially not for mtf post op colon-vaginoplasty patients.

I have long wondered about this question.  I have at times dated or hooked up woth guys who were 7-9+ inches.  It seems 5-6 inches of depth is the standard, so the numbers don’t match up.

Ya I mean it depends on each person Individually I guess but either way I think that lots of guys tend to be a bit bigger than average in my experience at least so maybe the numbers are off

The wiki has information on surgery and sex, but I don’t think I’ve heard of this issue before.

I’m not quite sure I understand what you are saying either. It sounds almost like you’re too tight inside. Do you dilate, and if so what depth do you get? Is the dilator larger length/diameter than your partner?

Ya I guess I’m not sure of the problem either and to clarify I do dilate and have gotten to the biggest one ( color orange - soul source dilators ) and he’s bigger in length and slightly in girth than the biggest dilator which I can fully fit in me no problems. Hopes this brings any clarification.

If he&#39;s bigger than your largest dilator it might explain why. That&#39;s  really large dilator though, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there&#39;s plenty of cis women who&#39;d have a problem too.
</p>
<p>
You can get larger dilators than that, but they are expensive

Ya I mean maybe that’s true but from what he’s said about his past sexual experiences ( all with cis women) none of them had problems fitting him in far enough while he went at a fast pace so I’m not so sure. Also I’ve had sex with a good amount of guys and while the issue sometimes comes up I was usually able to simply work around it or make it work somehow depending on positions, whether or not I was intoxicated, or which muscles I relaxed.

Is he bigger than the orange dilator?? Find that hard to believe.. and if not why can’t he fit all the way in but you can dilate with that? Have you tried dilating right before sex to open things up?

Did you get a z-plasty to fix the ring scar contraction? Was that from not dilating enough during early phase?   Are you saying mucus build up is causing you not to be able to fit the dick in fully?    I will check with my friend who had colon srs and ask..

I did have a revision surgery to fix to the initial surgery issues and ring of scar tissue and yes it was thought that the mucus build up most definitely caused a blockage in the vaginal canal. However, both of these issues have since been resolved and no further improvement really. I would definitely appreciate it if you could ask your friend who’s had this surgery.

I did contact one friend. Apparently she does mention as it gets deeper the width is tighter. She claims improvement with a larger glass dilator stretching width. But she is not sure about if her man is getting all the way in..
</p>
<p>
There is a Thai trans facebook group There it seems like half the girls get colon srs...

Ok great thanks so much I’ll definitely look into that! It would make total sense if that was the case, as thats is what my SO is claiming is the issue.

Also I’d like to add that yes the revision surgery may have had to happen as a result of not dilating to the exact frequency as needed( seeing as I was a senior in hs and couldn’t remain on home-bound tutoring all year or else I wouldn’t have been able to graduate). However, when I told the surgeon this he seemed not insanely concerned. Also the second time around I fully understood the importance and took a semester off college to fully recover properly. Hope this helps

Idk I mean my bf is an amazing guy who totally accepts and supports me in this regard and wouldn’t go out of his way to lie necessarily I think the issue is more that we both don’t know what is the issue and so we both try and analyze things from our respective POV. I also do agree though that a penis shouldn’t necessarily have to enter fully in order to finish from penetrative sex alone.

This.  Also there are various different angles and positions that naturally limit how deep a penis can go.  Have you tried these?  It may be something as simple as switching up positions to find what suits you both best.

Ya I totally recognize that fact as well, and trust me we have tried a lot of different ones. This may be TMI, but I do think it may be helpful info.... -Positions that work well for me- On my stomach/ laying down doggy Standing doggy Being on top( cowgirl) And sometimes spooning
</p>
<p>
-Positions that work well for my bf- Spooning Standing doggy Laying down doggy  Cowgirl/ me on top
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, I’ve personally felt that as of lately, he can get the farthest when I’m on top, but he claims that he actually feels like spooning is still the best in terms of feel and how far he can get.

Sounds like you two are good at communicating and trying different methods. Which is key. I don&#39;t really have anything more to add, but wish you two the best of luck in finding what works.
