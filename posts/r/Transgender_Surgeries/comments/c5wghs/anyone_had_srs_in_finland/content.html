I am finnish and I am thinking about my future srs options. Now if I do it in finland it would only cost me a couple hundred as my insurance covers most if it. But I don&#39;t know what the results are like because I can&#39;t find any information about them.

I have not had SRS in Finland myself, but I have examined one result and I also had a consultation for SRS in Finland.
</p>
<p>
From what I saw, there was too much erectile tissue left, which made it look like a micropenis when legs were spread. The urethral opening was at the tip of said ”micropenis”. It seemed like there had been no attempt to form any kind of labia, even though they will say to you in the consultation that labioplasty is part of the surgery. Everything was covered in hair, which is expected, since no hair removal is done during the surgery and no hair removal is recommended before the surgery by the surgeons. The whole genital area was kind of ”sunk” inside the body. The vaginal canal was a bit higher than it should be,
</p>
<p>
As a whole, the surgery result did not look like cis female genitalia.
</p>
<p>
They will tell you at the consultation that even gynecologists won’t be able to tell that the vagina is surgically made, but that’s just not true, unless the gynecologist is blind.
</p>
<p>
I ended up going to Chettawut even though I had the free option available.
</p>
<p>
Edit: The result I saw is considered a good result by finnish standards from what I heard.

It seems next to impossible to find anything about Finland - if you do please let me know and I&#39;ll add it to the wiki.

I&#39;m in Denmark, so fairly close by. From what I gather local surgeons, whether here or elsewhere in Europe aren&#39;t very good, compared to the big names, and it&#39;s not a surprise, given that they probably don&#39;t get to do that many surgeries or work too much on their technique. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if SRS is just one, seldomly used thing among other surgeries they do. There are a few names floating around - there was a guy in germany that supposedly uses a version of the Thai method, and there was a serbian clinic, that I am not sure even exists still.

I&#39;m in Denmark, and a bit unsure about the results here too. Going in for a consult next year, so I guess I can follow up then. Unsure about finland, but you might have more luck posting on
