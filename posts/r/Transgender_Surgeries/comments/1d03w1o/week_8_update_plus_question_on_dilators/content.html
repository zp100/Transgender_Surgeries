Your dilator uses a condom? That’s so kind it doesn’t want you to get pregnant!  😉😊
</p>
<p>
Seriously though, if these numbered dilators are similar to the dilators given by Dr Chettawut, then yes, indeed number 3 was a challenge.
</p>
<p>
Recommendations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
tons of lube, first on your body, then your dilator
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
over the counter painkiller 20 minutes before dilating
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
at the end of using number two, while it is fully inserted, try to move it slowly like a joystick and put pressure against the entrance walls.  Move joystick in a star-like pattern
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
after using number 2, with a glove, lube two fingers , start with 1 inside you, and then start with the second.  Once you have two fingers inside, gently start to spread them slowly, once again applying outward directed pressure against the entrance opening, try to rotate them gently and spread your fingers at different angles (as if around a clock, 12 and 6, 3 and 9, 2 and 8, 5 and 11 for instance)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
lube lube lube
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
then try number 3
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(For a week or two at first, I’d have a slow sip of some whisky to help relax, lol)
</p>
<p>
Don’t need these techniques anymore but they worked for me.  Now number 3 is my ‘starter’ dilator!!!
</p>
<p>
Best of luck. And of course, be careful and gentle  with your body as you’re gently coaxing it to do this new thing! 😊🌺
</p>
<p>
(FYI - the dilators from Dr Chettawut at WIH International Hospital are straight, white resin type hard smooth material that you don’t use condoms with.  You could probably order a set from them.)

If you choose to use oral medications, keep in mind it takes about 30 to 45 minutes to digest.

Already taken into account, the difference is  made up in the time used for the smaller dilators during the dilation session.

Thank you! The PAI dilators were straight, and far more comfortable, but I was told to always use condoms until 3 months to reduce the risk of infection if I bleed.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been scared to use fingers, but I think I’ll try that tonight. Thank you!!

You can put on a glove and then use the fingers if you feel more safe…

I use soul source and on the large orange one. A tip that helps is to have the dilator indent on the front of your mound going across horizontally otherwise the curve is digging into you sideways internally which goes against your natural curve.
</p>
<p>
Take your time with lube. Also doing frog legs whilst on your back helps alot, so does inserting slowly on out breaths.

I&#39;m struggling moving up to the #3 that the PAI use, and am glad I bought the complete set, and I&#39;m currently on the one in between the #2 and #3.   I&#39;ve not had as much difficulty as I&#39;m having now with going up the size, I just feel way too stretched.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s looking way better than mine is.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve just checked the sizes of the soul source - so you&#39;re on the same size I am now 32mm.
</p>
<p>
Have you tried starting with the #2 and then go to the #3?  A friend of mine suggested doing this, and it made the #3 PAI easier to get in, but I just find it&#39;s a smidge too tight, so doing another couple of weeks on the intermediate size.

Hi, interesting.. not my thread but I also have been with PAI.  I was going much slower with sizing up. I think I was a bit scared and hypergranulation in canal entrance does not help 😕 Right now.. I&#39;m using both 28mm and 30?(2nd white). I&#39;ve got 32 prepared for later when I&#39;ll be in better shape I guess 😃

I was told March size 1, April size 2, may size 3.  But the step between 2 and 3 feels so much harder.

It&#39;s interesting to me that a lot of surgeons seem to start small and go bigger since GRS Montreal just has you go straight to #3 &amp; #4. When my stent first came out both of those went in pretty easily and if anything I&#39;ve found they got a little harder as healing happened and things tightened, it feels like it&#39;d be rough trying to increase size at the same time as healing tightens the skin.

Huh, going by that I should wait until June for size 3. I’ll keep that in mind and not be so aggressive with sizing up lol

Girl I&#39;m happy for you! I&#39;m pretty much at the beginning of my dilation journey but I did get the purple dilator all the way in just now! I&#39;m officially 11 days post op so I&#39;m definitely ahead of schedule a bit.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you the most chill and pain free dilation sessions sis!

I haven’t seen anyone else mention it, but elevating and changing the angle of your pelvis makes a world of difference. When I went to my appointment with my pelvic physical therapist the day after I got out of hospital, it was the first thing she told me. Even 2 1/2 years post-op, I still use it on my once weekly dilation session.
</p>
<p>
As to insertion, I hope you’re starting with the dilator almost vertical until you reach your pelvic muscle. That’s when you change the angle downward and it sort of “fishhooks” deeper into your vagina.
</p>
<p>
I hope this is helpful.

Moving up in size roughly one dilator every month seems to be a good benchmark, so by now I would hope to see you are on green by now. If you are still on the first three, small purple, small orange, and big purple, I suggest doing longer sessions with extra credit in between.
</p>
<p>
For example, due to an infection, I didn&#39;t dilate for 2 days, at 3 months out from surgery I worked up to the largest orange dilator comfortably. But because things are difficult for me at the moment, I&#39;m dilating with 5 dilators, all 20 minutes each. Everything from small orange to big orange, and I might do extra credit where I dilate with each one for 5 minutes each in the middle of the day.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, be sure to take ibuprofen and ascetomenophen (Tylenol) at least 30 mins before you start, turn on some relaxing music, have a warm relaxing beverage, maybe add caffeine in the morning dilating session. Pretty much everything you can to relax
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, message your care providers and let them know you are struggling, especially if you have a lot of inflammation.
</p>
<p>
If you are like me, I would recommend starting a 1% OTC topical hydrocortisone lotion from CVS. Specifically the CVS brand and specifically the lotion and not the cream. That does way more for reducing inflammation, but even though it is OTC, you really need to be mindful to not use it for more than 30 days. If you still run into problems weaning off of it, you can try Manoka honey as opposed to Medi-Honey. They are both nearly identical products, the only difference is Medi-Honey costs 10X as much and has a couple of anti fungal additives to fight off yeast infections (I read the patent).
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps you.

Okay. My colors may be different than yours, size one for me is the big purple, then blue, green, and “big orange”. The size I’m struggling with is the one right under the largest

You weren&#39;t given the complete set then, you have the larger 4. When I started dilating, it was with the smallest purple, small orange, and then big purple, 10 mins on the first two, 20 minutes on the last. I had to work my way up to the blue, then green, then big orange.

Yeah, the size 1 of the large set was the same size I started at PAI so it worked out.
