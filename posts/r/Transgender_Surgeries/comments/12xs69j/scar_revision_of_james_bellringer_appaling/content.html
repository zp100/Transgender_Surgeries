I have been using silicone scar sheets, the thick cica care ones and not cheap crap that I used the first time.
</p>
<p>
Moisturising a lot with gentle scar massage as recommended by Ms Rashid. They do seem a lot softer than they were before and there do not seem to be any hard lumps underneath so that&#39;s a positive :)
</p>
<p>
I have not looked at vbeam or anything as I&#39;m following my surgeons limited advice so they cannot blame the results on me doing anything other than what I have been told to do. I guarantee the minute I go &#39;off script&#39; they will use it against me.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I think it&#39;s looking a lot better than it was ?

Everyone does VBeam in the UK : p Or failing that, just pulsed  dye laser, same thing. It&#39;ll change everything, I speak from previous scar treatment.

Following up on the scar thing. Seen a plastic surgeon at great expense and he said they are healing quite well considering my skin colour. I&#39;m a natural red head.
</p>
<p>
He recommended kelo cote rather than the generic silicone gel so I&#39;m going to start inning that. Said I&#39;m doing well with scar massage, no serious lumps and it should fade over the next year.... or two.  Painful to hear but mostly positive :)

I think we have spoken about this before. I am very sorry you are suffering. My experience is that you get this print out about caring for yourself post op and its discussed at your pre surgery appointment with the nurse about douching. Did you discuss in person with Rashid about the internal stuff?  Have you contacted your gender clinic for support?  My experience of Bellringer is his personality is like marmite and my labia little bigger than I prefer but I am very happy with my results and I know many the same but complications do happen and looks like your body over develops scarring. Looks much better after this revision so wish you the best but it may be worth calling  parkside direct. Bellringer does appointments on a Friday. I was told to book into his clinic of had issues and needed be seen. Rashid might have similar.  I&#39;m not an expert but there is options likely to resolve the internal issues like bowel lined canal if can&#39;t fix the issues and possible chronic pain support you can get also.

Glad you are happy with your result, looks really good! Can i ask you some honest questions?
</p>
<p>
How do you find dilating now ?
</p>
<p>
Are you able to use normal sized toys ?

Sure. Dilating ok i guess. I can sometimes get sore but passes after a moment. My main issue is I&#39;ve never sized up past blue so I&#39;m bit lazy but maintained my depth but will start sizing up. I can get normal sized toy in. I got a rabbit which bigger than my dilator and lot more comfortable and enjoyable.  Went to gyno recently and needed small speculum to get sufficient open but whilst its bit tight I&#39;m generally happy with the state of things.

Sorry I read your original message again.....
</p>
<p>
I have enquired about a colon revision but Ms Rashid said lots of things / complications etc and doesn&#39;t want to do it.
</p>
<p>
If I&#39;m completely honest I want (and was expecting it)  to feel more like anal sex rather than what it is. Hard to explain but I always thought it would be like anal minus the poop and cleaning out before etc. Anal is not the same now as there is extra skin in the way of my prostate and I&#39;m scared of doing it too much as the vagina prolapsed slightly last time I was having bum fun. Not nice at all :/

Ms Rashid has done a good job of excising the atrocious scars left by the original surgery carried out by James Bellringer.
</p>
<p>
The image is about 4 months post op scar revision and already looks much better than it did before.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the original surgery left me with serious internal issues that still haven&#39;t been resolved. The canal has completely closed up now to the point I can no longer dilate. The large bulges are still present and I still have pain in them and the groin crease. Parkside Hospital are not replying to me and have offered no support.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t know where to go from here.

Replying to my emails would be a good start.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not being excessive in my requests either. One or two a month. It took them over a month to send me the letter from my surgeon after my last checkup. In fact I heard about it via a phone call from the gender service 5 days before I received the letter.

What do you actually want them to physically do though?
</p>
<p>
You don’t want to see Bellringer again and you’ve had your revision from Rashid. Patients don’t have ongoing checkups at Parkside for SRS.

Ongoing checkups, why the hell not?  Its a mess that has not healed up. My GP has been amazing looking after the aftermath of a private company shirking their responsibilities to patients.
</p>
<p>
They ommited the requirement to douche on my consent forms and sent me a new Nuffield Health one that was not signed by me. It was Aspen when I had it done and it didn&#39;t mention anything about douching after every dilation. Honestly if they could have found one they would have sent it, they can&#39;t  find it because I never signed it.
</p>
<p>
What I did sign up for was the risk of complications. I expected maybe ONE out of the list and was more worried like any sane person about the anal fistula. Thankfully that didn&#39;t happen but I had several other complications, chronic pain being the worst.  Unsatisfactory aesthetics which they seem to have resolved. Little or no clitoral sensation, can&#39;t fix that and will probably never climax again. Vaginal stenosis, they are not replying to me. I also didn&#39;t expect to be left in serious pain while in hospital to the point that I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I lost my job because I couldn&#39;t drive on the painkillers and honesty I would rather be dead right now.

What purpose would ongoing checkups serve? Once it’s healed, it’s healed. That’s why it’s normal to only have one or maybe two follow-ups. There isn’t much that can be gained from looking at it. The only other option is more revisions.
</p>
<p>
Do you want a third revision from Rashid for the internals? What has she said about the internal stuff?
</p>
<p>
Re mental health, support- there’s nothing Parkside can offer. This would be something provided by the gender service or your GP surgery or mental health team.
</p>
<p>
The risks are made abundantly clear by Parkside and clearly, anything can ultimately happen. They don’t have any liability here. I was told 1 in 20 need revisions, 1 in 100 have serious complications. I was shown a few horrific photos beforehand, where I’ll be honest, the outcomes were far worse than in your case.

<p>
The cause is obvious, I just want a pathway out of it. I passed 4 mental assessments pre op, they caused by inaction and negligence what I&#39;m now suffering with.

<p>
LTC mandate several checkups over a year. One checkup is mandatory under NHS rules and that&#39;s what Parkside provides. Not great though is it ?

<p>
They did not tell me that I would have to douche for life. They cannot provide any evidence that they did.
</p>
<p>
I will add though that I&#39;m glad you are happy with your surgery. I just wish I was as well. Thank you for taking the time to reply.
