Great informative post, thanks for sharing. Congratulations on your surgery, glad to hear that your recovery is gong well. Are you using Manuka for the dehiscence? I found it really good.

I found it excellent.  I used it at night for the dehiscence. After cleaning and drying well at bed time, I put a good size blob on the open wound section (using sterile gloves), then a piece of sterile non-stick dressing big enough to cover the open section, then the panty pad.  The dehiscence healed beautifully, went from open and bleeding to closed in three weeks, and I&#39;m a slow healer.

Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been doing- exactly that-  but it seems to be healing more slowly, although at no point was it ever bleeding except on the day it occurred.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask what your discharge experience was like from the labias. Iâ€™m wondering if my discharge has been washing away the honey overnight, reducing its effectiveness. Iâ€™m at the point where Iâ€™m considering putting a bit of sterile gauze between my labias just above the dehiscence overnight and see if that improves things. Canâ€™t fault the scientific method can we ðŸ˜…

It does seem to take a while to heal, especially in the beginning.  Are you rinsing and using a hairdryer after every toilet? I also  lay with the hardryer blowing on the area for 10-15 mins a couple of times a day, and lie with nothing on and legs open for a couple of hours a day. Fresh air is very beneficial, and keeping the area as dry as possible really helps.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t really have a problem with discharge, the pads seemed to be quite effective at wicking it away.   Most mornings, when I removed the pad,the piece of sterile  dressing was still in place on the dehiscence, although the honey was almost completely gone  - the pad did absorb a fair bit.   You could try putting more Manuka on at night - I know the info booklet they give you says a &#39;pea size&#39;, but I put more like about three peas-worth on. The honey works by being a great antibacterial, and by pulling moisture away from the wound to promote healing, so more is better than less.
</p>
<p>
Which are you using, Activon or Medihoney? I used a combination of the two.

Iâ€™m using Activton honey, and I had bought some medihoney gauze in case it opened up and got worse but I donâ€™t use it.  And yeah I use about three pea size drops. I do the 10 mins with the hair dryer each time after douching. The trouble is, because of my swelling my labial discharge drips down as much as outwards and it quickly wets where I have dried, so unfortunately drying after every pee would be a bit fruitless.
</p>
<p>
I will start doing 1 hour a day of open air though after one of my dilations + drying, hopefully that will encourage it along nicely.
</p>
<p>
Thankyou so much for your help!

Honestly the more I see of Tinas results the happier I am with my decision! She&#39;s easily the best the UK has to offer!
</p>
<p>
Please keep the updates coming! And congrats on such a great looking vajayjay!
