I had surgery with Mozaic care, and wondering if pain tended to decrease to a much smaller amount after bolster removal?

The bolster was absolutely horrible for me, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. The relief from the sutures finally being cut was crazy, the pain immediately decreased from 9/10 to maybe 3/10. Painkillers basically did nothing. I&#39;m not sure if they understood how
<strong>
physical
</strong>
the pain was, it wasn&#39;t a mental thing. Literally the moment the worst suture was cut was instant relief. Having to spread my legs wide for them to cut the sutures was 10/10 pain for a minute.
</p>
<p>
The best advice I can give is to make sure you really, really take it easy with your range of motion with your legs while the bolster is on. They encourage you a lot to take short walks, which is fine, but make sure you only take little steps, not normal steps. Otherwise, depending on where the bolster sutures are, you might be perpetually tearing your skin, making the pain get worse and worse.
</p>
<p>
Going to the bathroom was also horrible because sitting down in that position would make the sutures tear at my skin particularly badly. I ended up kind of balancing myself over the toilet holding myself up with my arms because that was the least painful thing to do. In retrospect I would have gladly spent money on a toilet seat riser or even a bedside commode so I could s(h)it higher up for the first week.

The bolster was held in place with 6-7 sutures on each side, placed on the inner thighs about an inch away from the crease where the thighs meet the groin. The bottom few sutures were a little off the thighs and onto the buttocks. Those ones were hurting the most by the end of the week.
</p>
<p>
After the bolster was removed it was obvious why the pain had been so incredible. The sutures had obviously been pulling very hard, with some of them leaving long, razor thin cuts. I&#39;d say the bolster alone was 90% of the difficulty of the initial recovery period. The pain afterward was low enough that taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed was plenty good enough.

Pain from the sutures and the relief felt after they were cut indicate poor surgical talent, although they won&#39;t admit that. That whole area you are speaking of should be microstitched, all except for stitches near the Posterior commissure.

If you are describing the tube and bag they remove urine with, it is technically known as a Catheter. It is held in place by an inflatable balloon on the in bladder end. Never try to remove this yourself, you will cause great injury.
</p>
<p>
The toilet riser seat is an excellent idea.

The Catheter is NEVER held in place by stitches, see my earlier comment.

How bad has the pain been? I’m getting PPT with Mozaic Care in 2 weeks and I’m afraid of how bad the bolster is gonna be. :-/
</p>
<p>
I hope things start to get easier for you…it doesn’t sound pleasant.

The bolster fucking sucks, like for the first week i had no pain on my actual vulva, all of it was from the stitches on my thighs. She is doing a wound vac though so you might get lucky snd have that instead
