Are there any doctors in the United States that perform informed consent orchis?

Lost my testi&#39;s after a year through meeting a guy through the-EM.com, he asked me if i was serious about an orchi and then set it up for me. I wanted a skilled cutter to do it and thats what he got me. Bare in mind this is not through official channels, not someone with a surgical background and not something you should do alone or unprepared.
</p>
<p>
Getting an orchi is strict here, i wasnt gonne wait 3+ years while Cyproteronacetaat slowly ravages my body &amp; mind. I&#39;m glad i made the decision to find other ways. I was lucky and it was really skillfully done, dare i say better then a dutch surgeon lol.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s also private clinics that do it without needing a letter from a psychologist. I found one in antalya turky but that shit costed 2400euro. My underground skilled cutter did it and asked a fee somewere between 200-400eu so i gave him 250 because im a poor bitch ðŸ¤­ðŸŒ¹

Itâ€™s usually about insurance requirements not the doctorâ€™s. Mine was cancelled due to covid, but I didnâ€™t need any letters/etc. to schedule. I can tell you where I live/what insurance if you PM me, but Iâ€™d rather not post.

I&#39;d venture no..
</p>
<p>
Because HRT can be reversed somewhat and a disgruntled patient will largely be fine, given time..
</p>
<p>
Surgery is a hugely different beast as removal of an organ is permanent, and I suspect there are more strict guidelines to maintain their license, etc.
</p>
<p>
The closest surgeon for me requires PCP and 2 mental health provider letters just to start the consult and insurance pre-authorization. As a &#34;cover their ass&#34; system

Not pure informed consent, but M Michael Hayyeri in Phoenix, AZ.
</p>
<p>
They require 1 letter and afaik they don&#39;t have strict rules about it.  I think it can be from an HRT doc or a therapist or maybe even your PCP or any doc tbh. It seems like they just put a copy in your patient file and don&#39;t verify it or anything.  No waiting list either.  You can get a surgery date that&#39;s a week or two after your initial call to them.  Price is only $200 for the consult and $1500 for the surgery, if you opt for local anesthetic.  General anesthetic is way more expensive but I opted for local.

I&#39;d also start looking for a psych who will just sign it off without too much trouble.

You will never get it paid for by insurance.  Almost all urologists are men, and it must be a horrible thought for men to remove the balls of other people they consider to be men.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there can be all kinds of medical problems that would cause a health insurance pay for such a surgery.  The most common kind would be possible testicular cancer.  But chronic inflammation could be a reason, too.  Pain can not be measured, and doctors have to rely on the patient input and judgement for pain.

Yes! Iâ€™m sure there are doctors who do informed consent orchiectomy surgeries. It depends on where you live in the USA? An orchiectomy is a simple, cheap, outpatient, very low risk procedure. As a trans woman there are informed consent hrt places like planned parenthood. Granted an orchi is permanent. But if you are on hrt as a trans woman &amp; find a good urologist who will agree to do it why not? The rules for an orchi only apply if youâ€™re going through insurance I.e (one year on hrt, diagnosis of gender dysphoria, two referral letters) it actually could cost way less paying out of pocket at an outpatient urologist center under local anesthetic. Especially if you donâ€™t ever plan on full GRS/SRS. Just do some research- call or email a local urologist &amp; ask. Good luckðŸ˜Š

You might have to narrow down the location.
<a href="/r/asktransgender" rel="nofollow">r/asktransgender
</a>
has an informed consent map pinned. If you go to an informed consent doc, they can probably direct you to the local informed consent surgeons.
