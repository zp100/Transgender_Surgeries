I would start maybe only with forehead and orbital/temple ridge. Maybe chin. I wouldn&#39;t do your nose, it&#39;s beautiful. You are beautiful and have distinctive features and I would recommend being conservative with surgery and doing one or two things at a time so that you can decide to stop when you feel comfortable and not lose your look. That&#39;s my plan personally.

I‚Äôd second this.

<p>
To the OP you‚Äôre channeling serious Gal Gadot vibes for me and she‚Äôs stunning and has some masc features many trans people would say need ‚Äúfixes ‚Äú which is BS to the beauty standards. I‚Äôd say go conservative and you will still be you.

Shows how messed up the thinking that we all need vertical foreheads is then don‚Äôt you think? And that we shouldn‚Äôt advise or project these opinions on anyone. Let the individual work it out.

I mean...I&#39;m 6&#39;3...so I&#39;m probably always going to get some flack about being transgender even if I passed to most people. I do think Gal is beautiful, and transvestigators will always exist, even Nelly Furtado and Amber Heard get transvestigated...so if I&#39;m probably going to get transvestigated anyway...I may as well go for a look I like.

I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say but your last sentence basically confirms what we both know. That the ‚ÄúBeauty standards‚Äù set by those people and by society is pretty fkd up if a cis woman is told she isn‚Äôt one. Which goes back to what are we striving for as trans people? And why.

Around here I see cis women get ‚Äúclocked‚Äù all the time - regardless of facial features. Mainly more of the butch crowd, and it‚Äôs for everything from having a buzz cut to wallet pocket chain üòÇü§£
</p>
<p>
The irony is there will be a trans girl standing right next to them - in the ‚Äúproper‚Äù female gendered outfit - and nobody will even notice them.
</p>
<p>
I think cis people have shorted out and don‚Äôt know whether to scratch their watch or wind their butts now.

Thankyou. Yes i&#39;m pretty happy with Anna&#39;s nose approach, and feel she totally gets that for my nose. I do actually need nose work thought because my septum is bent AF and I have breathing difficulties. But yeah I&#39;m definitely glad to be having these procedure broken up into phases.

Oh that makes sense!! Anyways I think you are beautiful and you clearly have a female face. I think you should also do what you feel will help relieve your dysphoria. Good luck!

Hey everyone,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d like some clarity, and perhaps some brutal honesty.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for FFS in mid March with Dr Anna Sluzky. I&#39;m happy with what she can do.
</p>
<p>
Scheduled to have: Forehead type 3, orbital and temple ridge reduction, brow lift, nose, septo, and chin. In Phase 1.
</p>
<p>
In Phase 2, after some healing, we&#39;ll consider either dissolving cheek filler, and getting custom implants, or fat transfer to cheeks, under eye and temple regions, lip lift, jaw work and Femlar VFS. Again this is subject to how I heal, and how I feel after phase 1.
</p>
<p>
Phase 3 would be hair transplants. We&#39;ve opted to forego surgical lowering, as we both believe a nice result can be achieved for me without one.
</p>
<p>
FFS being round the corner has my head spinning like it did when I first discovered FFS procedures a few years ago.
</p>
<p>
My issue is, now my face confuses me. I&#39;m just under 2 years on HRT. With E, and the help of Masseter botox, cheek and lip filler i&#39;ve managed to tweak some aspects of my face in a way that makes me more comfortable with them.
</p>
<p>
I desire for my face to pass, ( other areas too, but this is about face) but I don&#39;t want it to lose its character. I think you&#39;ll see what I mean in the images. I feel like in some ways I pass already in the face. Definitely not in the makeup-free photos, I look like crap there imo, but in the ones with light makeup, and the one of me walking runway, my look may be strong or harsh, but I still feel it passes, at least in that one. I think my issue is my forehead size, brow ridge and really my main issue is my profile, everything else is to do with proportions to those main issues.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a 3D model of my Phase 1 FFS pre-surgical planning for reference. I feel it gets my features into passing territory.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the infodump. Basically, am I deluded? Does my face pass? Yes? No? If yes, when? Be honest, don&#39;t be mean. I need help re-centering myself with some outside perspectives, because i&#39;ve been staring at my face for far too long.
</p>
<p>
Thanks

You are very attractive but you do not pass for some of the reasons you mentioned. However, there is a good chance you lose your facial character in surgery. The reality is that it is very unlikely for you to be able to have both, so as much as you can aim for that I would still try to think about which is more important to you over the other-- passing or retaining your features. I can imagine since your career involves your appearance this is a very difficult decision and I owuld encourage you not to rush it.

Hey thanks for your input. I do feel this is true tbh. There is a difference between being &#34;attractive&#34; and passing, beauty may assist with passing, but it does not equate to it, imo.  I&#39;m weighing up which is more important to me, so I appreciate your input even if it may not be nice to hear. I&#39;d rather hear it here, and take that into consideration for my life moving forward, than be called a man and mocked, or worse in the street.

Hey I really appreciate the input you&#39;ve given on here, but please let people express contrary opinions. I need to hear there&#39;s as much as yours. I&#39;m paying thousands for life changing surgery, and I need to be very real with myself to help ensure it achieves the result I&#39;m after. If everyone said I passed, and I chose too subtle an approach and didn&#39;t end up passing, I&#39;d feel as if surgery had failed, the same goes for if everyone said I don&#39;t pass. That may lead me to pursue a more aggressive approach, and then I may mourn the loss of my overall facial character. I&#39;m trying to weigh up the value my current facial features have to me vs the value I perceive in passing, and trying to strike a balance and hearing a range of opinions really helps me. Ultimately, I&#39;ll do whatever I want to do regardless, but as i&#39;ve come to a point where I&#39;m feeling lost in my facial features (despite having felt that I knew exactly what I wanted previously AKA everything) a range of opinions really helps me recenter.  I&#39;m actually not even hurt by being told I don&#39;t pass, as not passing does not insinuate that I&#39;m in any way ugly.

Indeed it‚Äôs not. Been through it recently and the pain of people judging me for it. It‚Äôs a huge decision best dealt with with compassion and care from professionals and people you know a trust. I‚Äôm not stirring the morality pot, I just don‚Äôt think anyone and in particular a stranger has any place judging another‚Äôs appearance even if asked.

You&#39;re right as well, but I did ask for strangers to judge me. In my reality Cis people who are strangers, judge me every time I leave the house and they are very vocal about it and far less forgiving with their malformed judgements. I personally prefer to hear it here. I&#39;m sorry people have judged you for your decisions for your own body. That&#39;s not fair.

Am I the only one who thinks you&#39;re being a bit too hard on yourself? I feel like you not only pass but you&#39;re absolutely stunning as well. You have a unique look that I feel many cis women actually try to attain. You are beautiful

Aw thankyou, I&#39;ve always been my worst critic. I think overall its probably my height, voice and lack of breasts (currently) that betray my passability. I&#39;ve always tended to zoom in on my face due to other issues such as acne I&#39;ve suffered from in the past. I do feel that there&#39;s is room for improvement on the face still though.

I think you are very beautiful, your mouth specially.
</p>
<p>
I agree with your ideas. on the profile pic we can see better the nose for example. If I were on your situation, I would do the rhinoplasty and lower the hair line, wouldnt do much more. Also remember that breast augmentation helps a lot with passing, if its your concern. Even if you think your face is not passing, having good size breasts, help wonders. I say that due to my own experience.

Hey the comment was deleted before I could read it...do you happen to remember what it said, and would you mind repeating it to me? I&#39;m guessing it was harsh due to being deleted, but i&#39;d still like to hear it. I may have already thought of it myself anyway.
