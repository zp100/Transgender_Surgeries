I&#39;ve scheduled a consult with
<a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jess-ting">Dr. Jess Ting
</a>
at Mt. Sinai, and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with him? I&#39;ve found a few people talking positively about vaginoplasties with him, but nothing for FFS. He&#39;s the only one I could find that will take my insurance (Healthfirst). Has anyone here gone to him for any surgery? What were you results like? Would you recommend him? This will be my first surgery ever, so I&#39;m fairly nervous.
</p>
<p>
Update 12/24/24: 6 weeks post-op and I&#39;m super happy with my results! I&#39;d share pics, but given the current political climate, I&#39;d rather not post pictures of my face outing me as trans :(. Dr. Ting was great though. If anyone searches for this thread later, DM me if you have any questions. I&#39;d recommend Ting for FFS in a heartbeat.

This Dr was actually a pioneer is ffs and srs for a decade now, if not more. He trained my surgeon, Avanessian and many other surgeons. I personally have not been to him but considering my surgeon did a good job I’d say he’s good.

That&#39;s good to hear. I&#39;ll look into Avanessian and the rest of the people at Mt. Sinai to weigh my options, but I feel much better about going with Ting now. Thank you

The way Dr Ting trains them is more reconstructive so your ffs results will be still your face just not a lot of masculine features. With Avanessian that’s what she did but she also said it’s better to stage my ffs so I have to do a second round to really get the true fem look I want. They took such good care of me.

If you&#39;re working with Mount Sinai, definitely check out Dr. Horesh. He specializes in (and is very well known for) top surgery and vaginoplasty, but I&#39;ve seen his FFS work personally and was very impressed! He&#39;s also just a wonderful person and a super talented surgeon! He did my SRS and I couldn&#39;t be happier! I asked about FFS and he showed me some of his results and they were dead on with what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Ting is who taught all the surgeons within the CTMS - he&#39;s highly skilled and is known for doing very technical work where other surgeons have failed. Having met him, I&#39;d personally have no qualms going through him, but I&#39;m also partial to Horesh lol. Considering he was a well renowned plastic surgeon before going into gender related surgeries, I think you&#39;ll be fine!
</p>
<p>
For added fun, check out &#34;Born to Be&#34; - it&#39;s a documentary about him and his involvement with the CTMS.

Wow, thank you! I feel a lot better now. I&#39;ll look into Horesh and the rest of the Mt. Sinai team as well. My anxiety level has dropped significantly because of your comment. I&#39;ll be sure to check out that documentary as well &lt;3

I had my vaginoplasty done by Dr Horesh and can confirm he&#39;s incredible. Obviously can&#39;t comment on FFS, but he did an amazing job with my 😺. And yes, he&#39;s so warm and kind!

The man is almost too nice, like how can a surgeon be that comforting? He almost cried from excitement for me and gave me a hug at my consult lol, I wasn&#39;t expecting it.
</p>
<p>
The results I got are flat out amazing and the healing has been so damn easy overall because of his techniques. No wound separation, no dehiscence, no granulation, and the aesthetics have remained as amazing as the day he took the initial post-op pic!

That’s neat! I’m getting FFS with Dr. Chen who used to work at CTMS, I should ask him about Dr. Ting if I get a chance.

All I have from him in terms of FFS was a lip lift, I was super nervous about the lip lift scar to the point where I skipped it when I initially had ffs, later on I had a BA with Dr. Jess Ting and I just threw the lip lift on top of that. He ended up doing a perfect job and the scar is genuinely invisible to the naked eye, like we would have to touch noses for it to be seen by another person

Do you like your BA results with him? What was with his method? I haven’t seen much people talking about getting that procedure done by him.

Hi, me going with him was more of a convenience than anything else,  honestly I feel like he did just ok on that, on the right side it’s perfect, no notes, on the left I feel like the size I choose is just a bit to big even though it’s fine on the right, the left is taking a bit longer to drop which I think is just something that can happen, the one thing I don’t like is that my nipple on the left is noticeably lower than the right, I did have a fat transfer there prior to this so that could have been a factor but I think I will eventually get a revision for that side to size down a bit and to try and fix the nipple. Sorry if this was long winded

Just for the data-  us in the transmasculine lower surgery community realllllly don’t trust Ting. A number of years ago he attempted to pioneer a new technique of phallo called “Ting Phallo”.  This was pure experimentation on our bodies. His claims of it’s success were only in theory, as he had never done it before.  And when he finally did operate, he was totally winging it, and failing.  So many people were harmed and had to have total redos.
</p>
<p>
He was ordered by the NY Board of Medicine to cease this surgery technique immediately because of the harm he caused.
</p>
<p>
Im a phallo post op caregiver (post phallo myself) and I cared for one of his patients throughout their redo.  What that surgeon put this man through was honestly horrifying.
</p>
<p>
It’s clear he’s been successful in transfem surgeries though and the transfem community, overall, has had a very positive experience.   Just wanna share all the sides so people can make informed decisions.

Thank you for this perspective. I&#39;m feeling good about him now for my transfem surgeries after reading the rest of the comments, but this is absolutely worth looking into. I&#39;ll be sure to ask about what specific techniques he&#39;ll be using, how many times he&#39;s done them, and what the end results of those surgeries were. If it turns out he wants to try something &#34;new,&#34; I&#39;ll be more cautious.
</p>
<p>
Also I wouldn&#39;t want a transmasc individual to come across my post and think Ting is amazing if he has a mixed record with transmasculine surgeries, so thank you again for this comment.

Seems sketchy.... Does bottom surgery and also FFS? Would stay away from that. Someone who &#34;specializes in everything gender related&#34; likely is not skilled enough to master all of it.

Dr. Ting is a well renowned plastic surgeon, the director of the CTMS program, and has pioneered numerous techniques used by other surgeons in the US. He&#39;s also known as one of the only surgeons in the US that can fix Kathy Rumer&#39;s work. He&#39;s highly skilled and has taught those skills to all the other surgeons at Mount Sinai.
</p>
<p>
Hell, the dude even has a documentary about him lol. Look up &#34;Born to Be&#34; - it&#39;s a great documentary about Dr. Ting and the CTMS program that he leads.

He specializes in it, like can tell you what period of years someone has surgery based on what he sees. I had a friend who needed a pretty heavy revision because she had it done so long ago by Rumer, and she got fantastic results.
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s a wonderful surgeon, just a tad arrogant but for good reasons lol.

Thank you. That&#39;s a very good point, though a difficult one to hear since he&#39;s the only I can find to take my insurance. I&#39;ll still go to the consult, and decide from there

To provide you with a metaphor, would you bring your Bugatti to a mechanic who &#34;fixes everything&#34;, or would you take it to a specific mechanic who knows exactly how to fix the issue? Think of you face the same, and that might help. Ultimately it&#39;ll cost more to have revision surgery if your result is shit despite the use of insurance.

In this case, Ting has pioneered quite a few procedures and taught them to a ton of surgeons across the US, for both SRS and FFS. For any other surgeon who didn&#39;t do reconstructive surgeries like he had, I&#39;d normally agree, but he&#39;s in a league of his own.
</p>
<p>
This would be like bringing your Bugatti to the engineer at the factory who helped design part of the car based on test drives, then having him work on it personally.
