Honestly it&#39;s really tough to see much of anything in this picture. Any chance you could take a better picture with different lighting? Maybe zoomed out more for context?
</p>
<p>
Is it just the staining that you&#39;re unhappy with, or the overall result?
</p>
<p>
Once quarantine is over any laser place should be able to recommend exactly what laser method will help. Apparently with time and laser, a significant cosmetic improvement can be expected. If you&#39;re uncomfortable with that, I&#39;m sure a dermatologist could weigh in. Either way, both time and laser can really improve this type of thing.

I&#39;m unhappy with all the complications. This is only one of many. And the result is also very poor. I have inward curves in my chin where it meets the jaw. My face look overcorrected and disproportionate to my neck and body. He cut too much bones. I chew on my lip when I eat cause it is rolled in and stretched against my teeth. It has bumps on it. My smile has changed and it is weird. I have open incisions in my mouth. He did not stitch me up properly. I&#39;m still numb and have a bump under my chin which may be bone, suture or foreign object. I told him about all of it. He does not care and is dismissive. He does not know what the bump is and avoided commenting on the discoloration. I also have intense burning and cold sensation to my chin that I sometimes take pain killers for. That&#39;s 10 weeks since surgery.

Ok, this paints more of a picture. I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re dealing with all of this. I know this is all very difficult, but time can help with some of the things you&#39;re dealing with. The healing, maybe grabbing some extra stitches if things aren&#39;t going well, The bumps, the discoloration, the hot and cold sensation. 10 weeks is really really difficult with respect to jaw surgery, it takes months and months for that to heal.
</p>
<p>
I know it&#39;s so difficult, my FFS results the first couple months made me question my decision-making process daily. You&#39;ve just got to put some of it out of your head until you&#39;re a little more healed. I know that&#39;s super duper sucks, but remember you can&#39;t get procedures stacked on top of each other too close together, if you&#39;re going to get a revision, it will be down the road and we can worry about it then. Right now you just got to focus on healing and maybe when you&#39;re all healed the results won&#39;t be as bad as you think they are, you might even like them. The thing is we will have no idea until the swelling goes away and the stitches dissolve and the wounds heal.
</p>
<p>
Surgery it hard, facial surgery is really hard. Maybe nothing I said helped at all. Either way, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through something hard, and I hope things aren&#39;t as bad as they seem

The thing is I had other surgeries done before by board certified surgeons. In my experience normal recovery does not give you anything else other than temporary swelling, pain, bruising and numbness. Scars that are supposed to be there are obvious. Anything else is a complication. If you see you don&#39;t look right 6 weeks after surgery then it is likely you don&#39;t look right. Staining after lipo is a complication. I went into the surgery with normal lips and skin and I should come out with the same lip and skin. I could be bruised but again it should be temporary. No bruises last more than 3 weeks. At 2 weeks all my normal bruises were gone.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s common sense and I am not a fool to deny what is wrong to benefit the quack who did this to me. Thank you though for showing concern. You&#39;re kind.

Oh I totally understand that ideally everything would look a lot better and you wouldn&#39;t be experiencing some of these things at 2 months.
</p>
<p>
But to some extent complications are normal, and many of them resolve over time. I don&#39;t know a ton about the staining, I just know that time and laser can really improve it.
</p>
<p>
As far as the swelling and the numbness goes, for face stuff it takes a lot longer to heal than other surgeries I&#39;ve had. So I know after my FFS I was still swollen well into the fourth month. That&#39;s completely normal.
</p>
<p>
I will also tell you that I lost a ton of sensation, I pretty much assume with any FFS that loss of sensation is going to occur, it used to really bother me. The thing about loss of sensation is that eventually your body starts to compensate, and it stops being a big deal. I&#39;m not saying that everything is 100% okay or whatever, I just know that I did get some of the sensation back enough to know when something&#39;s touching me and you know move the parts that are supposed to move, it just feels a little bit numb when other skin doesn&#39;t feel that way. It&#39;s been two and a half years and honestly it doesn&#39;t bother me at all anymore.
</p>
<p>
Some complications will resolve on their own or with minimal intervention. I understand that you have some larger concerns about the aesthetics that seem super valid. I guess I just want you to know that lots of the things you mention won&#39;t be a problem in 6 months, And at that point you can move on with next steps only having to address a few specific concerns.

The thing is I did not have surgery to have more surgery to fix the initial surgery and spend more money on treatments to fix the complications from the initial surgery. If there are complications then the surgery was botched and the surgeon is at fault. But of course infection and hematoma are not always the surgeon&#39;s fault but in my case it was simply poor surgical planning and execution. I was just given the standard plan rather than being given a customised plan because Bart was simply lazy. On that day my surgery was performed there were I believe 3 girls he worked on in total. That&#39;s a lot especially that most of the girls that go there have everything done. I felt like he rushed me. A surgeon who is not just collecting fees will never rush a surgery as they know they are dealing with people&#39;s lives not just bodies. Unfortunately, Bart does not care. He will still eat, sleep and wake up the same unlike his disfigured patients.

Additionally, I don&#39;t know why he is also performing plastic surgery when he did not train in plastic surgery. OMFS and ENTs only perform plastic surgery after they receive additional training. Bart himself said in his posts regarding the MONA scandal that he is not registered to the board of plastic surgeons because HE IS NOT a plastic surgeon. So why does he do facelift, lipo filling, liposuction, nose job, forehead work, ears etc. OMFS in the US and UK only perform jaw and chin work and nothing else. So why does he do plastic surgery without years of fellowship in plastic surgery?
</p>
<p>
According to wikipedia he only trained for 8 months in plastic surgery. That&#39;s nothing. So what happened? He failed or thought after 8 months he saw himself as a self glorified ps? No wonder his soft tissues revisions are bad.

I know. Of course none of us want revisions, but sometimes we need them. Revisions are all too common, and sometimes a second surgery can get the results to where they need to be

I cannot really afford to have surgery anytime soon and like you said I need to wait since I know that repeated surgery in the mouth is bad. Again, I did not go into surgery to get more surgery. The logic is get it done right and have it done only once. And no I don&#39;t wanna be in the group of women having revisions all the time. Only unhappy patients and botched cases get revisions and I don&#39;t think it is common.

Downvotes when I&#39;m trying to help aren&#39;t the best look. &#34;The logic&#34; doesn&#39;t work out in real life. Bodies are weird. Sometimes people need revisions. This is plastic surgery, shit happens. Even the most skilled and careful surgeons are going to have cases where revisions are required.
</p>
<p>
Lots of people get revisions and it&#39;s super normal for all kinds of reconstructive surgery.
</p>
<p>
Obviously you&#39;ve got more going on than these results, I hope you have someone you can talk to. Good luck.

I&#39;m sorry, I missclicked. I wasn&#39;t down voting on purpose. Top surgeons do make mistakes but they are usually very very rare. Bart is not a top surgeon and has the highest number of complications. I thought, they were just isolated cases but I was very wrong.

I&#39;m fine with several sessions of picosure. I just don&#39;t want anything invasive. Honestly, I shouldn&#39;t be paying for it. Bart decided to give me lipo cause he said he now performs it on most of his patients. Then I spoke to someone from here and was told he said to her that she will not need lipo. So what the hell, he seems to be changing his mind all the time. In my proposal he said it is only when necessary. I had no sagging skin and had perfectly healthy skin. I&#39;m thin and no family history of sagging skin. I&#39;m assuming he started to give upperneck lipo cause patients complain of sagging, then I complained of my issue so he decided nope don&#39;t give em lipo. It seems he is doing trial and error on patients.

The thing is upperneck lipo is such a straight forward procedure and should not post any issues if done right by an EXPERIENCED PLASTIC surgeon. Upperneck lipo is not a new procedure and has been performed many times. I guess it is apparent here why I ended up with a botched lipo. I don&#39;t even need to spell it out.

Looking at this photo now I get an understanding what you were talking about. I dont want to get your hopes up but I had similar coloring on my neck area and jaw from fat transfer. And had the exact same on my thighs from lipo. All of it faded away by about 6 months (thighs took the longest). Hopefully with time it&#39;ll get a little better. Also, I know its annoying to hear but please give yourself at least 2 more months as 80-85% of swelling wont be gone until month 4 and 6. I currently look nothing like I did at 4 months. Although it wont fix all the bone work if what you suspect is true, you will likely look better than you do currently. Also, saw your recent post. I had a little issue with my bottom lip incision at about 2 months I got really concerned about it, but it ended up healing just fine. Just make sure to always swish salt water after eating to clean it out and help it heal. Wish you all the best

You&#39;re so kind. You sound like my sister who has been trying to keep me calm and helping me deal with my anxiety and depression since my face was destroyed by Bart in Belgium. I hope that the surgeon I plan to see after lockdown is lifted could tell me what is going on and what could be done to fix some of the issues I have. Thank you for the positivity.

It&#39;s been over 2 months and it hasn&#39;t improved. This is one of the many complications I got from my surgery with him. Clinics I&#39;ve inquired said to wait 3 or 6 months but it is hard to see this everyday. Does anyone have any advice or experience on what type of laser I should get? Thanks.
