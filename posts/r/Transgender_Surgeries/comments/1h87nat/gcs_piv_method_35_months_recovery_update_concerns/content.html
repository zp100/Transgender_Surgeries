I would definitely update us at 6 months and definitely be communicating with your surgery team. It could be the swelling will bring it to a more natural looking &#34;angle&#34; (idk the right word here) for where the canal opening is compared where the clit lies as well as the distance to the perineum and anus. All of that could improve with swelling or maybe not as my knowledge starts and stops with just what I&#39;ve observed and read about SRS.

I hear you! I really am starting to think I‚Äôm just healing really slow and my swelling is just pretty bad. I‚Äôm pretty surprised, as I was NOT really ‚Äúwell endowed‚Äù prior to surgery, but I do suffer from severe anemia and it‚Äôs been pretty exasperated since the procedure for some odd reason, I think that could be contributing to my increased swelling possibly. I‚Äôll keep you guys updated and stay in touch w my surgeon team as well! Luckily they have been very kind and cooperative so I have no worries about that. üíñ

I think part of the reason the vaginal opening is so high is definitely the swelling. But I also agree with others this probably needs a revision too (canal, minora, hood?)
</p>
<p>
That said I think that‚Äôs all workable and if you have good function that‚Äôs a significant plus.

I‚Äôll wait it out and see how it heals out before I make assumptions, but seeing these comments it‚Äôs starting to make me feel insecure and sad‚Ä¶I may probably call off the dating and what not if my vagina I‚Äôd basically ugly‚Ä¶ :(

I hope it heals for you. I am sorry I can not be of any help and do not know about your predicament, but it probably just needs more time to heal! also, you went to Ervin i saw? I dm&#39;d you more about that, if that is okay? ^w^

I think you‚Äôll be needing a revision by a different surgeon.

In what specific parts? Not trying to be annoying, just trying to take as much notes as possible :) I‚Äôm also not sure if it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶healing is weird? Cause it literally looks different everyday? I also don‚Äôt have issues with urinating or dilating so I feel kinda confused about everything

There would still be lots of swelling so thing will continue to change in the coming months. Perhaps it‚Äôs just bad photos, but what is the distance from anus to vagina? It looks to long.

I agree about the distance that throws me off‚Ä¶cause in natal vaginas I know it‚Äôs not that far apart üò≠ I also did JUST get done dilating before I took this which could skew the image but yeah. Idk tbh üò≠ I feel like the swelling is too prolonged, idk how others swellings go down so fast? I eat really strictly healthy and high protein diet and lots of fruit and vitamins, so idk what‚Äôs going on to be honest.

ehh, one often sees them close together, but tbh there is some variance and they can be further apart too

Oh also I wanted to add, I‚Äôve been adding a special feminine oil and also rash cream by the weleda brand after every shower to the site, which has been drastically improving the appearance of the site in my experience as well as the symptoms of chaffing or irritation due to dryness/eczema/etc.

I hope you get better. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t help since I&#39;m not familiar with your situation, but it most likely just requires more time to heal. I saw you go to Ervin, too. Would you mind if I dm&#39;d you more about that? Thanks!! ~ üéÄüíûüéÄüíìüíñüíñ
