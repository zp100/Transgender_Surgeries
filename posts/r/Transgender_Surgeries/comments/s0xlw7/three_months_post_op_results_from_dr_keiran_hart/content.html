Right now I get to about the third dot or just higher on the soulsource dialators which is roughly about 4.5-5 inches of depth. I had ppv with him.
</p>
<p>
Overall Hart&#39;s beside manner is fairly well however I feel like there is a lot of improvements he can make in a lot of areas especially when it comes to aftercare.
</p>
<p>
I had surgery on a Monday I had my packing in for seven days and I felt like that was far too long as he left me over the weekend to suffer in my own stink which really impacted my mental health.
</p>
<p>
I had a peritoneal skin graft failure at the base of the canal which I attribute to the extended time with packing left in so the skin didn&#39;t get a chance to air a heal properly
</p>
<p>
Its healed over time but has taken a really long time and only really improved when I saw my own gp for health care instead of waiting on belayed enail relpys from dr hart

Same here, actually 8 days for me. I think the packing also helps with the initial healing.

hahaha good to know thank you! I will definitely pack that. Were you allowed any visitors? My partner is coming over with me but I&#39;m worried she won&#39;t be able to come see me due to covid stuff

At the time it was no visitors in the hospital due to covid restrictions. Id best check on the current conditions/restrictions. I didn&#39;t have any visitors in anycase as I came over alone from interstate wa. Snapchat was a life saver at times when i felt really alone

Its not rude, the neo clitoris is underneath a hood of skin in a pocket with the ureathra. The glans tissue used to create the clitoris is separated from it but it&#39;s not prominent due to my high BMI (fat ass lol) if you look on my previous posts you make be able to see it but it&#39;s very hidden essentially.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not entirely pleased with that part but will probably look for revision in the near future to see what can be done
