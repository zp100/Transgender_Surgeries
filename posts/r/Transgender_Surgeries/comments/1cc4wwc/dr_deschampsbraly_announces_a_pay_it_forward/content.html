I just got this note from Dr. Deschamps-Braly.
</p>
<p>
I am a patient AND I have no affilation with D-B.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Patients and Friends,
</p>
<p>
We‚Äôre thrilled to announce the launch of Deschamps-Braly Clinic‚Äôs Pay It Forward program, offering complimentary gender-affirming facial surgery to a deserving volunteer nominated by the transgender community or themselves. Led by Dr. Jordan Deschamps-Braly, a world-renowned expert in gender-affirming surgery, this initiative aims to recognize outstanding volunteerism within the trans and gender diverse community.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Deschamps-Braly said, ‚ÄúEach week I meet so many amazing people from this community. Patients often tell me about the unsung heroes who generously give their time and expertise to help others. I wanted to pay it forward by honoring one of these hard-working volunteers with my own time and expertise. We hope that this spirit continues - locally, regionally and nationally - and we are excited to pay it forward ourselves.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The program was created to honor those who selflessly dedicate their time and expertise to support the community. Nominations are now open, and we encourage everyone to nominate individuals (or themselves) who are making a positive impact.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Deschamps-Braly added, ‚ÄúI look forward to learning about the nominees who are changing lives through their selfless work, and I look forward to using this new Award to change their lives.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs come together to celebrate and uplift those who tirelessly work to make a difference. Nominations for this year‚Äôs program close on October 11, 2024. Together, let‚Äôs continue to foster a supportive and inclusive environment for all.
</p>
<p>
To nominate friends, family or yourself please follow the instructions below.
</p>
<p>
If you want to NOMINATE someone for this special award, please email
<a href="mailto:Payitforward@Deschamps-Braly.com">Payitforward@Deschamps-Braly.com
</a>
and provide your nominees name, email, your reasons for nominating them, and any links to their work. You may also forward the application link below.
</p>
<p>

<p>
UPDATE: I am really sadden by the conversation has moved from who might be a good nominee to &#34;D-B is bad because he doesn&#39;t want to deal with insurance company bullshit&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Maybe just maybe we could get some good nominees in to his office

While this is a wonderful idea and I applaud them, a great way to pay it forward would be for surgeons to take health insurance.

For most states yes, the majority of healthcare plans don&#39;t cover FFS, regardless of whether or not surgeons would take it.

DB did not take my insurance. After fighting with them for over a year to get any sort of payment. I don&#39;t blame him.

Blame the insurance company not the surgeon

<blockquote>

I don‚Äôt think you understand how insurance works based on this comment.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh really ????? oh wise knowing sage /s
</p>
<p>
I assume you
<em>
must
</em>
be in the medical billing field. Let me give you a partial list of some of the screw-ups that happened.
</p>
<p>
The insurance company is Blue Cross / Blue Shield of Illinois PPO.
</p>
<p>
Per network requirements, the procedure list is submitted to Blue cross of california.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
month before (O-1 month): preapproval received from BC/BS of Illinois.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
3 months afterwards(O+3months): DBs office informs me that they have given up trying to get BC/BS of California to stop asking for more information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
(O+3months to O+4month): I contact BC/BS of Illinois, they inform me that they have no idea about the procedure. They have no record of the operation. Blue Cross of California has NEVER transmitted the information to BC/BS of Illinios.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
(O + 4months): 2 sheets of procedures finally transmitted by the BC of california to BC/BS of Illinios. Only there is a computer fuckup and only the second page of procedures with only 2 minor procedures is actually processed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
(O + 4months - O +6months): Multiple fuck ups. .....
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is where shit gets juicy.
</p>
<p>
I contact the California Insurance Commissioner (I am a california resident). They inform me that because it is BC/BS of Illinois that there is nothing to be done. But they will happily forward my complaint to Illinois commissioner. Nothing happens of course.
</p>
<p>
I contact my Assembly person in california. They contact insurance executives. I get contacted by an amazing person WITH IN the BC/BS of California insurance company. She has authorization to try to fix things that have risen to the level of assembly critters being contacted.
</p>
<p>
It gets messier AND I AM LEAVING OUT LOTS OF DETAILS
</p>
<p>
She spends MONTHS arguing with the BC/BS  of Illinois on my behalf. They hang up on her REPEATEDLY. They tell her she doesn&#39;t know what she is talking about.
</p>
<p>
She was a real advocate without her I would have gotten nothing.
</p>
<p>
I think my case aged her.
</p>
<p>
15 MONTHS after the surgery I got 10 cents on the dollar.
</p>
<p>
So Oh Wise OH knowing Sage.
</p>
<p>
After all of this I KNOW I KNOW more than you do about how insurance companies do (not) work.

I don‚Äôt think you understand how insurance works based on
<em>
your
</em>
comment. Insurance companies make you continuously jump through hoops, essentially hoping it‚Äôs too much of a hassle for you to keep pushing until you give up. Their end game is to say no.

This is so problematic for so many reasons even beyond that this is 1-2 people max being operated on per year. His pricing has nearly doubled over the past couple years, and he has moved from 3 cases per week to 5 cases (created a churn mill and the results are starting to show it). On top of that by all accounts DB and his office are less willing to deal with insurance, when I had my primary surgery with him in 2021 it was nearly all covered, even though I was out of network. I tried to lead a friend thru the exact same process last year and DBs clinic flat out refused to help.
</p>
<p>
The savior complex is also very strange, that he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúchange someone‚Äôs life‚Äù by offering free surgery. Not all trans people even want this procedure, let alone the full version of FFS that DB performs. This is clearly more of an advertisement than actual community help. If he gave a shit about us he would offer more flexible payment plans, help with insurance when available, and generally come off his high horse back down to earth. He‚Äôs a talented surgeon but this is a horrible precedent and a really demeaning program that infantilizes the transition experience into some sort of scholarship unless you have wealth. He should focus more on the patients I know who go into great amounts of debt just to afford him and other docs.

He needs to pick a lane then, you can‚Äôt pretend to be the savior of trans women while running a boutique high end cash only plastic surgery practice. He wants it both ways and thats just not how it works.

Like seriously - you have comment so much here about how horrible D-B is for offering a free FFS. What is your problem?
</p>
<p>
This is POSITIVE news for some trans person yet to be determined and you are busy turning this into a negative.

What is your beef?

so they want to help one of us for free community points and rip off the rest so DB can drive a Ferrari on weekends and get ferried around in his Rolls with a personal driver off the backs of desperate trans women, isn‚Äôt he so charitable! ü§Æ

I really can&#39;t figure which of the many contradictory reason why you hate D-B offering a free FFS based on merit.
</p>
<p>
I wish you would pick a lane.
</p>
<p>
I know lots of people who drive expensive cars. There is no reason why a professional who makes money can&#39;t enjoy it. I guess you think that someone who worked hard to get good needs to drive a 20 yo Ford Festiva as &#34;proof&#34; that they are not ripping someone off.
</p>
<p>
But no, wait - D-B is a horrible surgeon and no one should go to him.
</p>
<p>
But wait a minute, I forgot that he is a horrible surgeon because he sees too many patients.
</p>
<p>
Oh no, he is horrible because he charges a high price and and doesn&#39;t see enough trans patients.
</p>
<p>
Damn I forgot that he makes money off the backs of &#34;desperate&#34; trans women. I guess he is the only FFS surgeon around ?
</p>
<p>
I think that there is a few more twists and turns.
</p>
<p>
How about you just settle on a consistent reason to hate D-B?

He upped pricing at the same time as he limited his ability to customize results per patient and started running his clinic the same way an insurance mill would run, albeit with trans women now paying 90k out of pocket for the pleasure. The results have had a lot of issues since, particularly with chin ptosis and other soft tissue problems. I‚Äôve seen multiple cases where the girl is less attractive now after his cookie cutter surgery, where clearly surgical planning has taken a serious step back. This is taking financial advantage of a community, without doubt. Now anyone who cancels 3 months prior to surgery will eat the entire cost of surgery, and his non-refundable deposit just to schedule is $10,000, its lunacy. All of this happened within months.

Look I‚Äôve been you, he really helped me back in 2021, but the guy has some serious personality faults (including dating former patients after his divorce) and his clinic is heading downhill in a bad way. I am not a current patient and haven‚Äôt had a surgery there since 2022, this is based off reports from current and prospective patients, I had to stop recommending DB because I was getting bad feedback. Cherry picking what I‚Äôm saying out of context doesn‚Äôt change the situation.

I&#39;ll second that the guy has personality faults. He&#39;s pretty arrogant and dismissive. I think the &#39;best surgeon in the world&#39; stuff went to his head.

Why should I care about someone&#39;s personality flaws so long as they deliver results?
</p>
<p>
Wrt to who he dates: I am glad he is skoliosexual. Like seriously, why should I care? I don&#39;t care if my plumber dates his clients.

With regards to the ethics:

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
9.1.1 Romantic or Sexual Relationships with Patients  Romantic or sexual interactions between physicians and patients that occur concurrently with the patient physician relationship are unethical. Such interactions detract from the goals of the patient-physician relationship and may exploit the vulnerability of the patient, compromise the physician‚Äôs ability to make objective judgments about the patient‚Äôs health care, and ultimately be detrimental to the patient‚Äôs wellbeing.
<em>
A physician must terminate the patient-physician relationship before initiating a dating, romantic, or sexual relationship with a patient.
</em>
Likewise, sexual or romantic relationships between a physician and a former patient may be unduly influenced by the previous physician-patient relationship. Sexual or romantic relationships with former patients are unethical if the physician uses or exploits trust, knowledge, emotions, or influence derived from the previous professional relationship, or if a romantic relationship would otherwise foreseeably harm the individual. In keeping with a physician‚Äôs ethical obligations to avoid inappropriate behavior, a physician who has reason to believe that nonsexual, nonclinical contact with a patient may be perceived as or may lead to romantic or sexual contact should avoid such contact.

If the patient is a FORMER patient then there is nothing wrong with Dr. D-B dating a FORMER patient.

He offered to take me out for drinks multiple times when I was a current patient. The person he dated he met as a patient of his and invited them out during an office visit and it went from there. There is a longer history here, and it‚Äôs not best explained by quoting the bare ethical minimum for doctors.

Find out your allowed amounts for each procedure code .. this is how, not matter the out of network max deductible, they‚Äôll get you. If you work in big tech 5 or similar- well then we salute you - it‚Äôs on the house.

prior auth is easy and they are willing to do that because you have already dropped a $10,000 completely non-refundable deposit just to schedule (also a change in policy), they were unwilling to even submit the additional information the insurer asked specifically to cover my friend, I could fill out your prior auth form (and have for myself in the past to help smaller providers out), its lip service, they used to actually help patients get reimbursed

I don‚Äôt think anyone would care if he had maintained the same level of service, even with the price increases. Surgical results have started to deteriorate since the change, along with a more cookie cutter approach to patients, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for him to be as good of a surgeon with this many long cases every week. It‚Äôs a strange place at the moment, never thought after having such great results that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them. But the way they‚Äôve treated people I‚Äôve sent there recently is not ok, and this ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù sham is icing on the cake. Hopefully they figure it out, but this is showing such a lack of understanding for the community they serve.

feel like this will only be utilized to bully people for being clocky. even if used in the correct way its still bad optics. imagining being nominated out of nowhere would feel kinda bad personally.

maybe something that would help patients more would be allowing them to openly disclose their costs?

You know that whole &#34;no good deed goes unpunished&#34; thing? I try not to believe in it but reading the comments here, it seems disappointingly true. It&#39;s pretty disturbing when someone is helping others but instead of focusing on that generosity, too many people  shift the focus to themselves and their biases. Here is the reality. As a former and hopefully future patient of Dr. D&#39;s, I can honestly say he and his stuff are truly miracle workers. They are all kind, generous people who care about the trans community as much as anyone. Feel free to have a conversation about the medical system and the horrors of insurance companies. Just try to keep that conversation focused on a SYSTEM that is harmful and NOT shift to one that runs down good people doing wonderful things..

Why not just take insurance? It feels like this russian practice of choosing one small town a year to improve and fix and make a great celebration out of it while the rest of the country is falling in pieces. It leaves everyone dreaming of being the &#34;chosen one&#34; while not really moving the needle.

Has she said she wants FFS? I feel like nobody should ever assume that unless it&#39;s been outright stated. She may very well be happy with how she looks. Not trying to say you&#39;re being purposefully malicious or anything.

I hope the community can get out the word to the trans community. I am looking forward to hearing who the lucky person is and how they are a wonderful member of the trans community.

I have been trying to fond a private surgeon for o over 5 years now and my insurance approved my surgery and I got them to pay what they charge not what my insurance would pay it wasn&#39;t easy but I did but even still all of the FFS surgeon&#39;s that I contacted won&#39;t he consider sending it in to get my insurance to cover it and knowing that there will and pay them what the surgeon is charging but no luck. I am finally starting to give up. it&#39;s ashame to have to go through this I always my whole life always help people when I could my mom used to tell me that I should start thinking of myself but that&#39;s just the way I always was I took after dad even coming from a family of 13. my dad always still tried to help being even though we didn&#39;t have much. that&#39;s a good quality that I Learned from my dad. there should be more people in the world like that it would be such a better world. love thy neighbor.

Personally, I think this program is an awesome thing to be doing. We all know people in the community who work to build us up whether it&#39;s through activism, non profit work, etc. Often they have to prioritize doing the work rather than building up the resources to access care. The ability to potentially help them get FFS paid for entirely by the clinic would be insanely cool.
</p>
<p>
I know from experience that all the hard working people who are employed at the clinic tirelessly work to help expand access to medical care.
</p>
<p>
This program is clearly a net good and one I&#39;m excited to nominate a few of my local sisters for. I had surgery with the clinic at the end of last year, and couldn&#39;t be happier with my experience there. That&#39;s true for both the results and the care I received from all the incredible people who work there.

It‚Äôs really cool that he‚Äôs doing this, but merely taking insurance would be a much bigger ally move that would help far more trans people than offering one free surgery.
</p>
<p>
I recognize this isn‚Äôt an equivalent ask, but it‚Äôs just crazy that many of the top surgeons are only accessible by the richest and most privileged amongst us.

He‚Äôs regarded as one of the best, if not the best FFS surgeon in the world.
