That looks awesome @ 4-months. How is the vaginal canal sensation?

The sensation is good. Most of the pleasurable stuff is at the clitoris, but the canal is sensate too, a bit of pleasure but mostly pressure and a bit of texture detail, I can pick up on lumps and bumps if they&#39;re in there, and the right ones are pleasant :-)
</p>
<p>
The sensation is mostly in the first few inches or so, there&#39;s only dull pressure sensation at the top, which is understandable given how that part is made with skin that isn&#39;t innervated.

I&#39;d say they&#39;re more varied.  I&#39;ve had a couple of really intense ones, but others where I couldn&#39;t sustain it right and they ebbed away at the wrong moment, especially early on.  I&#39;ve had a couple where I could keep going afterwards which I&#39;d not had before.  Didn&#39;t make it to multiple orgasms yet,  but knowing there is potential for that was nice!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say my orgasms got
<em>
potentially
</em>
stronger and more varied on HRT (my partner noticed my convulsions after HRT but not before it, I didn&#39;t know I was doing them!), this seems like another change further in that direction.

I&#39;m scrolling, and scrolling, and lots of cis vulvas from nsfw and other subreds, and I see yours, and I was going to keep scrolling, because I thought it&#39;s just another cis vulva. Great result üíãüíãüíã

Here are my pictures 4 months after my first op with Dr Schaff back in March. There&#39;s been some progress, a bit of a setback, and thoughts about what I want out of my second stage op at the end of September.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the progress.  Sensation continues to improve, and I&#39;ve been getting used to how everything works particularly at the clitoris, which was sore with a few stitches earlier on.  These have now finally fully dissolved and although there&#39;s a tight part, it&#39;s easier to work around than the stitches were!  Depth has improved a little, which was unexpected: it&#39;s now at 19-20cm, and on the last photo the dilator is fully inserted to the point it isn&#39;t visible.
</p>
<p>
Setback-wise, I started reducing my dilation to daily with no placeholders as mentioned last month, but things got unbearably tight after a few days. I contacted Dr Schaff and he told me to get back on the dilation more regularly again, so I went back up to 3x a day until I was comfortable, now I&#39;m usually doing 2x a day, with placeholder (see my previous months&#39; posts for detail on those), which I&#39;ve increased the size of a bit.  It all seems to be helping, but I&#39;m going to keep at that for little while longer yet.
</p>
<p>
In terms of second stage work, I think I would like the top of the labia majora to be reshaped so they&#39;re not so prominent, I&#39;d like to see if the clitoris can be made a little less bulky (the hood will be formed too, that&#39;s a given), and at the bottom, there&#39;s a method of making it a little less tight which should make penetration easier, as there&#39;s a lip there at the moment.
</p>
<p>
So, not perfect, but I&#39;m getting more pleasure a bit more often now, either by myself or with my partner!  The tightness has been noted there when playing inside, both by me and my partner.  For me it would be nice to be a little looser and that would make things a bit more comfortable but I hope this will come in time.
</p>

Yes, this was the combined method. I&#39;ve gone into it a bit more in other months&#39; updates if you&#39;re interested

Yeah updates would be nice üòä  There is another person who had the combined version by Dr. Schaff (don‚Äôt now if I am allowed to tell her name) and hers looks different.  That‚Äôs why I am little bit confused. üòÖ

Mine is after revision, but I wouldn&#39;t say she&#39;s much different. My result 4 months post-op was very similar. Dr Schaff method is quite recognizable, though hard to distinguish from cis ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A Revision is a second surgery that improves aesthetics and some function too. I also refer to it as &#34;Second stage&#34; above.

What&#39;s the combined method? I have been thinking a lot about how practical it might be to have penile inversion for the outer 1/3 and colon for the rest... is that what combined is?

I&#39;ve gone through it before a bit, but very basically it&#39;s penile, scrotal and urethral tissues.  The scrotal tissue is at the top of the canal, furthest away from the entrance, and the urethral skin lines the front, it&#39;s not detached, instead it&#39;s split and flattened at a certain point and goes around to line the front, pretty much to the top.

Your description is correct, but I think a bit misleading, because &#34;front&#34; can be understood as &#34;at the entrance&#34; and it&#39;s not. Urethral tissue covers whole depth of vaginal canal, and around one third of the width. The other two thirds of the width are covered with electro-cauterized scrotal skin and with penile skin at the entrance.
</p>
<p>
The way it&#39;s done is that urethra is detached from other penile tissues, and it&#39;s folded into vaginal canal, whereas above the u-turn there is urinary opening, just below clitoris. The part above opening and below clitoris is also made of the small fraction of urethral tissue.

Is that why it&#39;s so nice and shiny looking as well? I&#39;ve noted that cis vaginas have The Shiny (tm) but it&#39;d be hard to replicate. Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t notice!
