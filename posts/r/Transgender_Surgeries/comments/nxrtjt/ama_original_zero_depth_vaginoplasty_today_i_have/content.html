Hahaha, love my canal too! And please, stay strong with dilations, they will be hard at first but it is temporary, and the amount of satisfaction your canal will bring you for the rest of your life is worth that little pain!

I fully intend to. I even made sure I was cleared to do it at work - they even got me a loveseat for my office to do it in privately!  I made sure I was ok so that should someone see and think its a dilshouldn&#39;t! K that I&#39;m doing activities at work I shouldnt!  No one should see but at least I&#39;m good in that area should something happen!

First, congratulations! I so happy for you! :)  I have many questions! Mostly because I&#39;m strongly considering zero/min depth. But also because I&#39;m low key thinking about an orchie in the meantime to take the edge off. I just don&#39;t have the time in my life for dilation, and feel the vulva really might be enough (also a lesbian). That said, in a perfect world, I&#39;d have been born with this equipment, which would mean having a vagina/canal. So I
<em>
could
</em>
change my mind someday.
</p>
<p>
Obviously don&#39;t feel obligated answer anything you don&#39;t feel comfortable answering.
</p>
<p>
How was recovery for you on both the orchie and the zero depth?
<br>
How long ago was the orchie?
<br>
Did you use insurance? If so, did it cover all three procedures?
<br>
Was there any concern from your surgeon around adding the canal after creating the vulva in a separate op?
<br>
Did you discuss the possibility of coming back for a canal after the vulvaplasty ahead of time?
<br>
Was there resistance to that idea?
<br>
What was the canal made from?
<br>
Did they give any sense of how the recovery might be considering this latest op is a somewhat less invasive procedure than a full outie to innie procedure?
<br>
Anything that you think I should know as I try to decide both the immediate, and long-term fate of my bits?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for any and all advice. &lt;3 &lt;3

Omg thank you thank you for all of this. Absolutely no apologies necessary. This is so helpful.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure how to ever find my way to a decisive answer on this. Going for full depth is such a massive time commitment that would disrupt my life for a long time. Dilation would be so tough with my work schedule and the overall recovery for full depth would keep me away for a while - something that could take years to recover from (I&#39;m a freelancer). Min depth feels like a good sweet spot, with its easier recovery, and would absolutely eliminate the vast majority of my dysphoria . An orchie on the other hand would help a lot, but would almost definitely still leave me with a ton of dysphoria. Full depth just feels so impossible right now.
</p>
<p>
Decisions decisions. :P
</p>
<p>
But seriously, it&#39;s so nice to hear from someone who has had the trifecta, and can speak to each of them individually. &lt;3
