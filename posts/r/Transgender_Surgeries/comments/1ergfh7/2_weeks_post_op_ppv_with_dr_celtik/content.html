Are you satisfied with the surgery? How many dilations are you doing at the moment? How painful have these weeks been for you? Does it hurt when you urinate?

Very satisfied and happy with the outcome. I do 4 dilations a day, they started out really easy but have gottten a little more difficult as healing has progressed. Not too hard, just gotta have some patience. Mainly nerve pain, itâ€™s quite annoying sometimes. No pain when urinating, sometimes a tiny bit of discomfort but not usually.
