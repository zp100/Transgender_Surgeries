I met him before as well, he is really nice but I think in person consultation is important for those who are anxious about surgery and need reassurance..and its a shame he doesn&#39;t do that.

In 2012 I found it impossible to even get information via phone or e-mail. I asked for an information packet in that summer, with plans to book for May of 2013 due to combined work and university schedules, and kept being promised &#34;in a couple weeks&#34; but it never materialized. All I could get was information about booking and, once I sent the letters and deposit, the required medical forms. The only other information that ever arrived was the pre-surgery prep packet sent after my final payment.
</p>
<p>
For me a consultation or real information packet would have lead to deciding against having that surgery as some of the low-probability risks were &#34;I could not live with that result&#34; (some of which I did experience and continue to struggle with how to live through.)

I am sorry to hear your experience. Thanks for speaking up. I am sorry if this sounds intrusive, do you mind telling me what were some of the low probability risks you could not live with? You can message me if you want but if you don&#39;t feel comfortable it is okay.

I&#39;m comfortable answering it in the open. Poor sensation, worse orgasms after surgery, a vaginal constriction that developed just over 1 year after surgery, and have ongoing pain issues.
</p>
<p>
Poor sensation: I had complete numbness of my genitals for nearly a year. Sensation did recover somewhat but remains limited and there are numb spots. Clitoris is one place that fully regained sensation but became hyper-sensitive to the point of stimulation being painful I also never really mentally integrated my new genitals. Mentally my map of my body is of no genitals, basically.
</p>
<p>
Orgasms are probably self-explanatory.
</p>
<p>
When I began tapering off from daily to weekly dilation I got a constriction situation that made dilation excruciating. I spent most of a year trying to find a solution. I did contact Brassard&#39;s office during this stating the problem I was experiencing and asking for a consultation and was refused; informed that &#34;there is nothing that can be done surgically for you. The problem is either you&#39;re not using enough lube or you aren&#39;t getting relaxed.&#34; I tried months of pelvic physical therapy, muscle relaxers, plus a host of less severe solutions but none brought relief. I ended up abandoning dilation because it had come to be occupying as much time in my life as it had on the early dilation schedule.
</p>
<p>
You know the intense &#34;shock&#34; pains typically associated with nerves reconnecting that occur for a relatively short period after surgery? They happened for the first couple days after surgery for me and then stopped completely until sensation returned, but then have never stopped. They aren&#39;t as frequent today, down to an average of a few times per week, and they&#39;re also not as sharp but are more drawn out. Some are intense enough that I&#39;ve had to make sure I was seated and pull-over and park if riding my motorcycle because I was beginning to get tunnel vision during it.
</p>
<p>
I will note that I did have some serious red flags about risk of a bad outcome. I hadn&#39;t actually wanted that surgery in the first place and definitely wanted other surgeries more, plus I was in a marriage that was abusive. However, I had run out of options to keep HRT access; my third HRT Dr was telling me &#34;you&#39;ve had long enough; you need to either schedule surgery or detransition&#34; (it was the last vestiges of classic gatekeeping) and I couldn&#39;t find another in the area, while I was prohibited from going out of the area or DIY by my spouse. Further, Brassard was not one of my top choices but the best option for whom my therapist would agree to write a surgery letter (the only other one she would was in Belgrade.) Finally, I tried to cancel a month before but was faced with a threat of escalation of the abuse (I truly believe I would have been killed by that spouse for it) and the emotional abuse severely escalated immediately after surgery - the first argument came before the spinal block had even worn off! I ended up having a breakdown in the month of recovery right after as a result of the frequent fights. While I can&#39;t say for sure that either of those were part of why I had a bad outcome they certainly could not have helped at all.

I am so sorry. Nobody should have the surgery if they are not ready to or don&#39;t want to. The seemingly dismissive attitude from the Brassard office is really annoying. You deserve way better treatments from them.

I might have gotten better if I had the follow-up e-mail address rather than their main contact address that went to the front office. Unfortunately my then-spouse said she had thrown away the folder because she didn&#39;t see any reason to keep it once surgery was done (it would later turn up in discovery during divorce; she had filed it in a weird place.
</p>
<p>
I might have ultimately had it of my own volition, but I would have preferred to have other surgeries first, but my therapist and HRT Drs were opposed to either (they felt it made transition &#34;too easy.&#34;) There&#39;s no way to say because I&#39;d had pressure to have that surgery since coming out in 1994.

That&#39;s one way to put it! They actually fought against an informed consent training we put together years later, insisting it would lead to wide-spread regret (they didn&#39;t appreciate when I said, &#34;because you&#39;re restrictive approach did such a good job of prevented me from regretting. I told you I didn&#39;t want that surgery and you said my choice was have it or lose HRT.&#34;)
