As promised 21 days update. Healing continues to go well. Discharge from vagina mostly stopped although the dregs of the douche come out always at the wrong time! Some discharge from vulva area, and white fibrous material present. Bit raw still at the fourchette (bottom of &#39;V&#39;), and dropped the blue dilator a week ago as it was pulling things apart. Dilation with purple continues to go fine and can reach about last dot. Lost a half inch since first ever dilation I think. I will re-introduce Blue dilator if fourchette area continues to heal. I have a suture line across right labia which I hope will be less visible with time and I still have swelling, particularly left, but it is going down slowly with icing. Pretty happy with healing at 3 weeks. Doing daily walks and all household chores at this point and ability to sit is slowly improving. Need to get back to my cycling as put on 4KG since Op!

Absolutely amazing result at only 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for sharing, it&#39;s making me feel better that I have a revision with Tina in the next few months to fix the scars and some other issues that Bellringer left me with.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t be in a rush to start using blue again, all you have to do is maintain depth until the fourchette is healed. You can always add girth later if you want.
</p>
<p>
Are you massaging the scars to help prevent them healing stiff?
</p>
<p>
Congratulations again, really good result x

Couple days over 3 Weeks post op, and actually now back working part time (I am a programmer), just a couple hours a day to start with frequent breaks. Listening to the body, it tells me when its had enough! Energy levels back to normal, but have to wait for more healing before I can get back to running, and the mere sight of a bike saddle currently fills me with dread! Fully functional with regard to cleaning, cooking, shopping, driving etc though.
</p>
<p>
I think going into this &#39;marathon-fit&#39; has paid dividends in terms of recovery, and thus far very lucky not to have had complications &lt;touches wood&gt;.
</p>
<p>
If I could give anyone else any advise it would be to use whatever time they have remaining until surgery to get super-fit. By that I mean be able to run a marathon or cycle 100 miles etc.

Looks great, very impressive work. Swelling can take a long time to resolve. The more exercise the better as long as the surgeon okays. Post-op weight gain happened to me, too. I had to pay better attention to my diet. Walking up hill here in San Francisco helped. Congratulations!
