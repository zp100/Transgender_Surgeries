<p>
On March 24, I had type 3 forehead reconstruction and brow lift, jaw contouring, and a sliding genioplasty with Dr. Rolfes in Minnesota. I previously provided
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/tu73zl/ffs_with_dr_rolfes_one_week_summary/">an extensive post</a>
at my nine day post-op point with photos and a detailed accounting of the lead-up to the procedure and that first week of recovery.
</p>
<p>
I want to note up front that this post is not meant to be critical of Dr. Rolfes. I think he did the best that he could and I think other results posts on this subreddit show that he is qualified and capable and a great choice for a lot of people.
</p>
<h1>
Continued recovery
</h1>
<p>
I went back to work 18 days after the procedure. By this point, my energy levels had mostly returned, although I still had an ugly brownish scab forming over my hairline incision. There were two points where the scab sort of &#34;came loose&#34; and started bleeding gently, revealing a little bloody hole underneath. Those holes scabbed over and eventually healed as well. It wasn&#39;t until about a month after the procedure that the scab started to fall off and reveal the pinkish scar underneath. That scar has continued to heal and is covered pretty well by my hair and is pretty much unnoticeable as a result. The swelling in my chin and jaw had returned to &#34;normal-looking&#34; levels around a month in, although obviously they are still swollen. Around the one month mark was also when the stitches inside my mouth started to dissolve and disappear.
</p>
<p>
As for the injury to my lip caused during surgery, it has healed very slowly. For the first month or so, it kept scabbing over, then the scab would break and bleed a little, then scab over again. Eventually the scabbing fell off permanently and revealed a bright reddish scar. At my one month post-op appointment, Dr. Rolfes insisted it would continue to heal and likely become paler and paler until it eventually blends in with my skin, but at the three month mark this has yet to happen and it has not really changed in appearance at all.
</p>
<p>
When I returned to work, I got positive reactions from several coworkers who knew I had the procedure and what it was for. A common theme was &#34;you look like your own sister,&#34; that the results had been subtle but feminizing. I felt my confidence growing and when I looked in the mirror, I felt as though I was starting to see a woman instead of a man. In particular, the difference was stark when comparing my pre-surgery and current photos.
</p>
<p>
For a couple of weeks, I was riding high.
</p>
<h1>
Things take a turn
</h1>
<p>
A month after surgery, I started to feel a bit of post-op depression. I had read many posts on this subreddit and knew this was a very common and typically temporary side effect. Although I felt like my face was more feminine than it used to be, I could also see my face was still fairly long and had sharp angles to it. In particular, I became worried about my chin, which still appeared to be considerably longer than those of cis women. However, knowing that these effects are usually temporary and that most people start to feel better around the three month point, I pushed the thoughts aside and trudged forward, knowing I just had to be patient.
</p>
<p>
On May 3, about five weeks after surgery, I was sitting in my car outside a restaurant waiting for my order to be brought out to me. When the employee came out, she glanced at me through the window and said &#34;I&#39;m so sorry that took so long, sir.&#34; In an instant, I felt my whole world shatter. I went back to my office at work, my mind racing -- was it because she only got a glance at me? Cis women sometimes get misgendered at a glance too, right? Was it because I had a button-down shirt on? Maybe she couldn&#39;t see my face clearly through the windshield and took a guess?
</p>
<p>
After stewing on it for a few days, I decided I needed answers. I posted my photos to various online communities, including Reddit, that are known for honest and non-hugbox feedback. The response was mixed at best. A number of people have told me they thought I passed well and looked very feminine, while several others said they could still clock me easily because of my features. A number of respondants expressed surprise not only that I even had FFS, but that I had even been on HRT at all.
</p>
<p>
I started to think back. In hindsight, the clues had been there. My VirtualFFS simulation had been very underwhelming, and one of the other doctors I had consulted with, Dr. Kuperstock, had told me there was only so much that could be done for a long face and chin. In many communities I browsed, the notorious &#34;horse face&#34; came up constantly in discussion as the most damning thing a trans woman could be cursed with, a heavily masculinizing and conventionally unattractive feature almost impossible to fix with surgery. My initial one week post on this subreddit received only a handful of upvotes and comments despite what I felt was a lot of useful detail and information -- that should have been a clue too (posts on this sub usually receive upvotes proportional to the success of the person&#39;s surgery).
</p>
<p>
My thoughts started to become consumed. Every day I would closely examine my face in the mirror and compare it to images of cis women, trying to figure out what was missing. My face being so long certainly wasn&#39;t helping anything, and that was being contributed to in part by how long my chin still was. Should my hairline have been lowered further? My eyebrows raised a bit higher? Would a rhinoplasty have helped? I found myself thinking about features I hadn&#39;t considered before, like my droopy, mismatched eyes. Could a canthoplasty or blepharoplasty help make them more feminine? Every day when I go out in public I feel terrified that people are staring at me, that they can clock me just as easily as they could before surgery. I can see it in their eyes when they talk to me, the way they don&#39;t make eye contact or change their tone of voice, the nervousness and awkwardness that comes from speaking to a nonpassing trans woman.
</p>
<p>
I think what I began to find most frustrating was that not only do I not pass, but that I&#39;m also
<em>
ugly
</em>
. My features are not conventionally attractive for a woman. Before surgery I had hoped for one of two outcomes -- that I either pass well as a woman, or that if I don&#39;t, I at least look beautiful and conventionally attractive despite being clocky. Obviously, I&#39;d take passing
<em>
and
</em>
beauty, but I&#39;m willing to settle for one or the other. Instead, I&#39;m left with neither.
</p>
<h1>
Where I&#39;m at now
</h1>
<p>
It should probably not surprise you to know that these feelings have not gone away. Unlike many people whose post-op depression improves around the 3-4 month mark, mine has not. I spend a considerable amount of time in the mirror, trying to parse out what is still wrong with my face. I posted another round of recent photos to my usual online haunts, and once again got a mixed reception. Comments range from &#34;you pass perfectly&#34; to &#34;I could clock you from thirty feet away.&#34; I know what people will say -- there are bad actors in these communities who deliberately fuck with you by saying mean things. But a quick perusal of
<a href="/r/transpassing">/r/transpassing</a>
will show that people who do, genuinely, pass well and are pretty receive a large amount of responses and upvotes, the overwhelming majority of which are positive.
</p>
<p>
I should stress that none of this is meant to be an indictment of Dr. Rolfes. I believe he did the best he could with the very poor canvas he was given. There is obviously a change in my facial appearance before and after, considering how masculine my starting point was, and certainly I&#39;m glad I had the surgery vs not having it. I have my three month check-in with him in a couple weeks and we&#39;ll discuss further. The only thing that continues to bother me is the wound to my lip. He has insisted it should heal, but it seems fairly clear that it has permanently scarred and is very visible (it looks like I smeared ketchup on my lip). He has alluded to potentially doing something to try and fix it, like laser scar healing, so we&#39;ll see what he says at my checkup.
</p>
<p>
I had hoped to try and start dating at the three month point, once my healing was settling in, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to bother now. Nobody, especially not straight cis men, wants to be seen dating such a visibly trans person. I imagine chasers and &#34;T4T&#34; are in my future if I ever want to be loved.
</p>
<p>
I know what a lot of you are going to say -- that my healing isn&#39;t complete yet (I doubt my chin is going to magically shrink an entire inch in the next few months), that I&#39;m delusional or dysmorphic and need to talk to a therapist (I have one, thank you), or that &#34;FFS isn&#39;t supposed to make you pretty&#34; (no, but it is supposed to make you pass, or what is the point?).
</p>
<p>
The overall point of my story is this: FFS is not a miracle cure for all facial types. People with very long faces need to undergo a very rigorous consultation process and understand that there is only so much a credible surgeon can do to reduce your chin and jaw without causing serious nerve or muscle damage and loose skin. As has been noted many times, FFS (and estrogen in general) works best for people who were already blessed with softer, more feminine features like a rounded face.
</p>
<p>
As for me, I&#39;m going to continue trying to push through each day. But it&#39;s very difficult. Looking at my face in photos or the mirror makes me nauseous. I&#39;m extremely nervous interacting with new people. I&#39;m lonely all the time. I frequently cry myself to sleep. I regularly skip meals. Old thoughts of self-harm I thought were long gone now resurface regularly. I&#39;ll give it a few more months, but at some point I&#39;m going to have to make some difficult decisions about whether I want to continue living like this.
</p>
<p>
I apologize for writing such a depressing post. I know nobody wants to read something like this on this subreddit. But I needed to get my thoughts down and in writing. Thank you for reading.

A lot of hugboxing goes on , on reddit. They know someone might have an Arnold Schwarzenegger face and claim They look like Brittney spears or some bs. They ask for criticism and get mad when you Call out their clocky masculine aspects. Take everything with a grain of salt

I remember your original post and was excited because I&#39;m having surgery with Rolfes as well. It was a great writeup and a really solid contribution to this subreddit.  The difference between your before and after is pretty amazing. You have a very pretty face and if I saw you on the street I would assume you&#39;re cis.
</p>
<p>
I agree with a few of the other posters that being obsessed with cis feminine beauty ideals is kinda toxic. Most cis femmes don&#39;t fit into that ideal box and most of us trans women don&#39;t either. That in itself is a kind of beauty and something that bonds us to our cis sisters.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ve got so much life ahead of you. I hope you find peace with your new features.

It took me about 14 months to really appreciate changes from my FFS and a lot of that came from improvements in lower face and chin swelling.

<a href="/r/Transpassing">r/Transpassing</a>
is 1000% a load of bullshit.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Passing&#34; is when people who
<em>
don&#39;t know that you&#39;re trans
</em>
can&#39;t tell that you&#39;re trans. The existence of a reddit for this reduces a huge part of the equation AND it hyperfixates on flaws which real world strangers, and even transphobic bad actors, won&#39;t pick up on if you don&#39;t give them other reasons to think that you&#39;re trans. That subreddit is an unhealthy environment that creates dangerous insecurities
</p>
<p>
If I weren&#39;t trans, and didn&#39;t already know that you were trans, I honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to tell from your pictures (though i am trans and I know that you&#39;re trans, so it&#39;s impossible to know if that&#39;s really the case). Also, even with the long face, I do think you&#39;re still overall quite conventionally attractive and beautiful. I know nothing anyone here says will really make you less insecure about your chin/jaw, but don&#39;t let that insecurity knock down a really pretty face
</p>
<p>
Also you&#39;re 3 months post op, jaw can easily remain swollen until 6 months or so, things may continue to improve!

I&#39;m sure half of the posts on transpassing are cis people looking for compliments or just taking the piss.
</p>
<p>
You also get transphobic people in there just saying everyone looks their assumed AGAB.
</p>
<p>
Honestly I think you pass. Yes you have a longer chin than most cis girls but let&#39;s be honest here, we are comparing with the 1% beautiful and the 95% photoshopped media we expose ourselves to every day of our lives. Hell I see more unattractive cis girls than attractive ones every single day in real life and know I&#39;m probably always in the unattractive half :/
</p>
<p>
Thing is I know I&#39;m happy and so is my partner. I may not be able to make myself attractive (can&#39;t afford FFS) but I sure as hell can control the rest of the way I look and know for a fact that I look a lot better than at least 80% of women in my country when wearing a bikini.
</p>
<p>
You are attractive and your FFS is very very well done.

I felt similar to you after my FFS. I knew within the first month it wasn’t there yet. At the 3 month appt we planned a revision; Rolfes is very good about working with people on that, in my experience. I also agree about the bit where people tell you to wait because things will change; my opinion is you can pretty much know in the first month how it’s going to look
</p>
<p>
Edit: also want to add: I was much happier with the results after the first revision. Going back to Rolfes in a couple weeks for a second revision (though not as extreme)

I don&#39;t know if I want to bother with a revision. Not only would I have to go through all the difficulty of the chin/jaw surgery again, but also, if he could take off more why didn&#39;t he do it the first time? I specifically asked him to be as aggressive as possible and singled out my chin as a dysphoria point.

I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve been unreasonable in anything you&#39;ve expressed in this thread. Perhaps overly-critical, but even that&#39;s not unreasonable, given that you have to live with your results. As
<a href="/u/DRain64" rel="nofollow">u/DRain64</a>
said, revisions happen, probably pretty often. I think at this point you should rest and recover, do whatever you can to gather your strength, and lay out the steps for what initiating a revision would entail. You are already working on the step of determining what you&#39;d like to be different and seem to have done your research, so check that off.
</p>
<p>
You are worthy of love. You are worthy of self-love.

They can&#39;t take too much the first time. For example, I&#39;ve seen people with very big noses who had to do a revision. I hope you feel better and I suggest you to have a revision if you&#39;re not happy with your face.

This is all super toxic thinking…I think you should get a therapist or speak to your therapist about working on loving yourself. I think you’re beautiful and pass just fine. eventually, to survive, you’re going to have to learn to give a few less fucks. It’s hard, believe me I know. Trans women gotta let go of this cis-enforced standard of passing. I think from these pictures you pass and you’re pretty but who tf am I lol

I believe you could shorten the chin even more and lip lift would help too; otherwise, you appear female to me.
</p>
<p>
In addition, cheek augmentation will also do wonders for you.

I can&#39;t do a lip lift because too much of my upper teeth are already showing when I open my mouth. A lip lift would expose even more and give me the &#34;Napoleon Dynamite look.&#34;

Have you thought about fat injection in your cheeks ? It would maybe help you get a rounder face.

If you want to pursue additional surgeries and procedures such as implants and fillers and whatever else to beautify your face, that’s up to you. But objectively speaking your face is feminine and looks cis.

OMG girl you are beautiful and totally passable and the change in the profile is just - WOW.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that you will learn to love your face over time because it really is beautiful.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t hug box people. I sometimes &#34;clock&#34; cis people as an exercise in &#34;oh yeah women look like that too&#34;. I suggest you spend some time people watching because you are so solidly within the range of normal cis female facial appearance and you are attractive to boot!
</p>
<p>
That profile! Just WOW. I think I&#39;m envious...
</p>
<p>
Edit: One other suggestion - avoid looking at yourself obsessively. Put yourself out there on dating. You&#39;ll have the situation where people are swiping you because you&#39;re beautiful and haven&#39;t read your profile to find out you&#39;re trans (if you decide to disclose) and even that can be oddly validating. But be prepared for the occassional transphobe too...
</p>
<p>
Get involved with something, anything, that helps the time pass. Then when you get that time under your belt it will be easier to let go of what only you can see and see who you really are.
</p>
<p>
Your hair is also fabulous!

Are you local to the Twin Cities area? If so, hi neighbor! Rolfes is on my short list due to proximity.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m gonna be honest here. I read your post before looking at your pictures, and I was expecting you to look
<em>
rough.
</em>
You know what I thought when I actually looked at them? I thought you looked
<em>
fine.
</em>
I thought you looked
<em>
pretty.
</em>
I mean, yeah, I can see what you see as problem areas. It&#39;s true that your chin and jaw area are a little longer than is typical for a cis woman. But the truth is that every woman has a &#34;clocky&#34; feature in some way if you inspect her hard enough. Like, I can recognize you as trans, but that&#39;s because I know you are. If I just passed you on the street, it probably wouldn&#39;t cross my mind.
</p>
<p>
Again, I&#39;m telling you what I see straight up. Not hugboxing. There has been a VAST change from before to after.

I&#39;m familiar with the LeFort, but it&#39;s a dangerous, extremely invasive and very long procedure (months of special orthodontics, etc) for what appears to be a very minimal result. My much bigger problem is my lower third tbh.

This is only my opinion, but I honestly think you have a lot going for you if it helps at all. I feel like transitioning is also partly an art past your normal like guidelines and measurable features. I think there are lots of women with long face shapes like Kelly Rowland, liv tyler, toni Braxton and it’s more about how you accentuate your features and make yourself feel more confident. I know this isn’t a solution but just a thought ❤️ I’m early in my transition but this is how I’ve been going about it for now in that I’ve been really trying to find other womens shapes like mine and do things similar to them.

Reese Witherspoon has a much smaller face than I do. It&#39;s not uncommon for cis women to have large chins, but usually the rest of their face is a different size and shape that speaks femininity. Mine is not.

Some are gifted with any abundance of physically desirable traits. Some are blessed with close friends and family. What we all have is the power and right to pursue happiness. I see in you a completely charming woman with a very intelligent and kind character. You must allow your face to continue to recover and I hope you will see the beauty I can already see in you. I too have a longer face although it is definitely shorter since my surgery. Immediately after surgery I wanted to see a classically beautiful reflection looking back at me. I didn&#39;t get that but, what I got was a woman that had left her manface in the past. Now I use makeup to make the most of what I have. I smile more and I laugh more and I remember to give myself a little kindness too. A large part of my recovery is just staying optimistic that I will find comfort in who I am becoming.  Surely, you can see you are a feminine version of your pre surgical self? Please give yourself the time to find the beauty in yourself that so many respondents have seen and commented upon. Your generosity of character is clearly revealed in your assessment of Dr. Rolfes. For what it&#39;s worth I think you&#39;re right about him. Your experience has touched me .

I’ll be honest, you look pretty passing to me. Maybe I’m not seeing something that you’re seeing, but based on the photos you’ve posted here and on your profile, you pass. I don’t think I would have clocked you in public. It could be that you’re sending out masculine behavioral cues to those you interact with or something, but you look good to me! I am 100% not trying to minimize your dysphoria, cause girl I go there regularly.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think you can totally rely on Reddit upvotes as a measure of whether you pass or not. The ladies getting hundreds and thousands of upvotes are often the ones who look conventionally beautiful. That doesn’t mean other trans ladies don’t pass, it just means they may not have facial symmetry or whatever.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wanting to look like some celebrity or supermodel, I can’t help you with that; a lot of us have to come to terms with the fact that we will never be in the top 10% of hotness, to put it bluntly. But if you want to know whether you’re pretty, if you’re passing, then - no hugboxing - you pass to my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Please keep us updated on your progress and know you’ve got a lot of fans cheering you on. :) I’ve got FFS with Rolfes in March and I appreciate you being honest about your experience!

I&#39;ll be honest, I saw your picture and looked at it closely and the title of your post confused me. I just saw a pretty girl. Then I read your post, and in some ways I see where you are coming from, but I still don&#39;t understand. I still see a pretty girl. When I looked at your before and afters I was genuinely surprised and impressed with the change. Due to my more advanced age I don&#39;t expect I will ever really pass. I&#39;d be thrilled to the moon with your results, so that may color my opinion a bit, but again, I just see a pretty girl.  Keep working on these feelings with your therapist. I&#39;d never worked with one until I started HRT 6 months ago, but mine has helped me start to develop a clearer, more positive experience of myself (I still have a LONG way to go) and I couldn&#39;t imagine trying to process all of this stuff without her. Finally... You have a gorgeous head of hair! &lt;Hugs!&gt;

your hair&#39;s too long and the bangs are too sharply angled for a long face, it&#39;s why the pic that&#39;s in profile looks great (your hair is back and the length is out of frame) and the other ones look much longer, especially the ones where you&#39;ve used an angle that distorts the face even longer. 3 months is nowhere near enough for chin recovery too but you went over that. like, not that your face isn&#39;t long, it is, but the way you&#39;re framing your face matters a lot

I feel like I&#39;m always getting contradictory advice on my hair. I was previously told that a middle part made my face look longer. I don&#39;t know what else to do with it. I don&#39;t think my hair is the problem, it&#39;s my face.

if i cover your forehead it&#39;s honestly like if nicole kidman was a regular person idk, curly hair is such a pain to do any kind of bangs with but taking length off the forehead with more and rounder coverage would look really good if you can find the right shape. the center part does look worse but it&#39;s doing the weird al thing which is just what curly hair loves to do if you don&#39;t wet style it exactly right, lol. just as a reference(!) here&#39;s nicole kidman with her hair doing the weird al thing and looking pretty masculine even with professional makeup because her slightly long chin gets dragged down by the hair&#39;s long straight lines going right down either side of it

It&#39;s true about long faces. I&#39;ve seen it myself and with friends - long faces can only go so far and might never pass. But yoi can definitely come in range to where it&#39;s not shocking or repulsive on sight.

Can I suggest a haircut ? cut into a bob, not all one length though ! a very loose one, shaggy and messy.. around chin length or slightly above ? It will really help with your face shape. You do have a long face but many people do - the trick is to not have long hair too. If you cut it at your jaw it will widen your face and your overall look. So much of beauty is about proportions and balance .. this is a really good way to do something easy and natural that will make a huge difference .. discuss it with your hairdresser .. and as I said : not an all the same length bob - that would be too harsh .. let’s all the curls do their iob ! Please report back to us ! Sending love xx

Look, this all can be hard. Our mind plays tricks on us. That said, you look great and FFS made a huge difference. I’m 7 months out and still have moments where I clock myself in the mirror and then have days where all I can see is a woman.
</p>
<p>
I’ve found I struggle the most on days I don’t do a little makeup or let my eyebrows go.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, I think you pass just fine!

I’ve seen photos from your previous posts. The ones with styled hair definitely look more passing than the ones with messy hair.
</p>
<p>
I disagree that the length of your face is a problem.

You’ve definitely got a little Sarah Paulson thing going in the eyes, cheeks and jawline.

Which pictures would you say are styled and which are messy? My hair frizzes up a lot, it&#39;s unfortunately inevitable with fine, curly hair, but otherwise I put about the same amount of effort into my hair in every photo.

I was just looking at your posts in the order they appear on your profile. The more recent ones look more styled, the older ones less so. Although as a correction - I think the part makes a big difference. Centre part seems to look less styled, side part seems to be more flattering.
</p>
<p>
As someone who also frizzes (like a spool of cotton candy!) I feel you with the curly woes.
</p>
<p>
I saw someone else suggest a hair cut? I think a nice flattering style that frames your face would also play up those (as I said) Sarah Paulson features. And probably make it more manageable by getting rid of some of the weight and bulk to make it work for you. You’ve got amazing hair and great curls! They might just need tamed a bit.

You look extremely beautiful post-op. It might also be the general voice or attitude or body frame. I was called sir from 10 feet away even though I was wearing a dress, bucket hat, and mask. Can’t even see my face and I got clocked. Just enjoy your new beautiful face hun!

For what it&#39;s worth: I feel much better now almost nine months later. I was actually going to make a new post soon. I&#39;d say around the six month mark I started feeling better about it. His revisions are free with the exception of anaesthesia/OR fees, so don&#39;t stress about paying five digits again.

I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re feeling better, at 9 mos.  Your photos really do look female, and nice.  And I&#39;m quite critical.  I made a plan with Rolfes, but I&#39;m not totally clear what to do yet.  It&#39;s soooo sweet that you could go with you dad too - wow

I think looking feminine for a woman goes hand in hand with beauty (according to cis people standards). Even if you&#39;re a pretty but androgynous woman, most cis men will probably think you&#39;re &#34;ugly&#34;. You had a very masculine face so that&#39;s why you don&#39;t look as feminine as some Trans women. I think a revision would be a good thing because you can&#39;t expect to look completely feminine with only one round in your case. Like others suggested, I would highly recommend cheek implants or fillers. Otherwise you look fine. Don&#39;t lose hope, just wait a little more and see how it goes.

I just went to Rolfes. 2 days back to back…14 hours in the OR. I’ve heard from multiple folks who went to him say that it was 9 months to a year before they started liking the way they looked. Interested to hear whether you’ve turned a corner mentally. You looked great at three months.
