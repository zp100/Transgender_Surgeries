So im 7 weeks post op tomorrow, i had my check up today with mr fenton.
</p>
<p>
And i started dilation today!!! It didn&#39;t hurt at all!!! . I got 5 dilators and started with the 2nd it went in easy with no pain at all.  I have to dilate once a day for 5-10 min untill i get to the biggest one. Maybe go up in size every 2-3 weeks. Im so over the moon i picked that surgeon and his technique.  In the waiting room was also stephanie hirst, who had srs with him and a few other mtf girls and ftm boys, all having a chat and a laugh together, as mr fenton ran an hour late.
</p>
<p>
Im seeing him again in January / February for a little cosmetic touch up surgery. Ill only be in a day or max over night.
</p>
<p>
Either then that i absolutely loooooove my results. The scaring is not visible in the groin at all. Only further in the back towards the butt cheeks. But its only 7 weeks and they will fade alot over the years.

Ps. The girl that had surgery the week after me, i email her alot.her follow up appointment isnt till 9 weeks after surgery.  One of the girls there today told me she did loads of research on him. And the way he seperates the muscles and alignes the vagina it closes up alot lot slower

Mr fenton has s different technique. You dont start till you are healed more and have less swelling. And i get why now. As it really didnt hurt and i had no bleeding. And i read so many crazy scary story&#39;s about dilation from others. So glad i didn&#39;t start on day 5 ;/

That&#39;s very unusual. Is 7-weeks the first time you put anything in there? No stent?
</p>
<p>
Would you mind saying what depth you got?

I dont know how much depth it is yet, i spoke to two girls that had it done a while back, they started with smallest dilator wich is 7cm long and 1.5 cm that&#39;s all they could fit and then gradually moved up. The 5th one is 16cm long and 3.5 cm thick.  Mr fenton said depth will be between 5-6 inches when fully expanded again.
</p>
<p>
He also fixes the neo vagina to the back of the bladder somewhere. Wich is why he never had a prolapse in 28 years of doing this surgery.
<br>
But it should be no less then 5 inch depth.
</p>
<p>
The girl i spoke to had 6 inch or just under.
</p>
<p>
And no the way he alines the vagina and seperates the muscles it wont just close up like that he said. And after a year of dilation daily he said i wont need to dilate anymore he said its not necessary.

It&#39;s the first time I heard that someone could separate the muscles to make the closure of the neovagina slower, and to make the dilation less painful or even pain-free. Please definitely ask him more about it and post more :)

She had surgery with him when he still did private work. But she also had a cosmetic touch up as he is a perfectionist he dies that 4-7 months after the main op. That&#39;s why i like that hes a plastic surgeon and not a urologist. He has eye for detail. Function is fine. I had my first orgasm  2 days short of 6 weeks. Dilator went in really easy and pain free. So that&#39;s also brill. Yea i just spoke to stephanie again over instagram she said the results look even better closer to a year post op  when its fully healed. I dont know how much better it can get. But after my cosmetic touch up surgery in January ill post a picture on here as i think alot more girls need to know about him before he fully retires.  Today there were 7 girls waiting for him and 3 guys that had top surgery.  We were all having a chat while waiting fir his delayed arrival. They were all happy. Some with slight hick ups , one had more bleeding the other had an infection. But that&#39;s normal and can happen. Main thing they all seemed super happy. X
