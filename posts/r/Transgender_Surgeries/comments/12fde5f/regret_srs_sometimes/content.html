I do hope for you that you&#39;re able to orgasm again...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for my GCS, and when I asked about orgasms he told me that some are able to after just a few weeks, but for others it can be a year or longer. When I&#39;m cleared to he recommends I get myself a vibrator to stimulate my clitoris and get things working again...
</p>
<p>
Thank you for posting - I hope that this, and posts from others with problems or disappointments prepare me properly for my gender reassignment surgery and that I&#39;m going into it with my eyes wide open.

I feel your pain 😞
</p>
<p>
People say it gets better after a year and at 16 months I&#39;m feeling just meh.
</p>
<p>
People also say it can take well over a year to be able to climax. I&#39;m hoping this is true and we can both manage it in the future.
</p>
<p>
You are not alone, others feel similar things to you. All I can do is send you good vibes and wish you luck. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat x

I feel you. I had my SRS 5 months ago and my depth is ridiculous... barely reaching 7,5 cm when I try really hard. I haven&#39;t had orgasm yet although thanks to vibrators, my sensitivity is improving and it becomes enjoyable but still not an orgasm. I often feel like I will never get any better than that. And the fact that the aesthetical result is unacceptable, makes it evem harder.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I don&#39;t regret it. Even though it doesn&#39;t work well and doesn&#39;t look good, it calms my dysphoria quite a lot.
</p>
<p>
I keep my fingers crossed for you to get the big O soon!

I hate saying this but 5 months is really early.  I was still struggling to sit upright at that point for more than half hour.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetics will improve even though its hard to believe when you have to look at it every day. Maybe look back at pics every month or so, you will see how much better it gets. Don&#39;t forget to moisturise and massage ! Really can&#39;t say this enough.  I have had two goes and... just massage the Flippin thing,  try not to be scared and use lots of E45 etc.

I know it&#39;s early but I also know how a neovagina should look like even after 2-3 months. Another thing is that the surgeon is very unresponsive and seems not to care and if I only followed the post-op care he told me, I would have run into major problems. That said, I have no idea what you mean by mosturising, the Flippin thing, E45, and the etc.  For the protocol, I am in the Czech Republic.

Moisturise and massage of the scars will help them heal better.

Your experience and others like it shows the importance of choosing the right surgeon. Complications can be very difficult to deal with and it’s critical to reduce the chance of them happening, and to have good care in the event they do.

I feel you on the depth issue. Dilating is a chore for sure. My depth is questionable. Im just too tight for penetration. As for orgasm, my nerves started to wake up around the 9 month mark. Be patient with yourself. I can orgasm now and it’s great.

I’m sorry to hear about your struggles. I have depth and am functional, but I feel really ugly right now. It’s definitely not all happy.

Are you on antidepressants or Finasteride? They can both cause sexual dysfunction.

It can cause sexual dysfunction and can be long term. Some people 1/20mg is sufficient to use, and no one uses that.

honestly not be this person but PFS is a bs pseudoscientific thing.
</p>
<p>
Haircafe on Yt has some amazing vids on this
</p>
<p>
Finasteride actually raises Test and e levels. It pretty much just blocks DHT which isnt a necessary metabolite  and only blocks it locally like in the hair and skin.
</p>
<p>
Hormones are much more likely to cause sexual dysfunction cause no testosterone esp on a male body is going to take sensation down a ton.

I see you saying you miss a functional penis, but do you think maybe what you’d really rather is a functional vagina?  Totally understandable.

</p>
<p>
I understand your feelings, but please have some perspective. You&#39;re still healing.  Your nerves are reconnecting and literally rewiring how your brain understands your new body parts, and your new hormone levels.
</p>
<p>
This is major surgery that is both physical and psychological in nature. Your doctor should have gone through this all with you, it&#39;s not uncommon to feel this way for a year, sometimes longer as everything sorts itself out.  9 months is a long time - but not in terms of GRS recovery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
The first year is rough. There&#39;s no way to sugarcoat it. It&#39;s important to take time for yourself, reflect on this - but understand this is temporarily.
</p>
<p>
The years afterwards are MUCH better. I know it&#39;s difficult to hear - or to wait through, but you have to have patience.
</p>
<p>
You have decades in front of you.
</p>
<p>
This is a speed bump. It sucks for now but you will figure your way out and then look back at this as being a minor annoyance but worthwhile.

Maybe, maybe not. I had my grs 5 years ago. Since then I&#39;ve lost my depth, and orgasms are getting harder to achieve with time.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s still pretty simple for me, because a broken vagina and clitoris beats the hell out of what I was born with.
</p>
<p>
My point though is that time doesn&#39;t heal all wounds. Hopefully it will get better for her, but it might not.
</p>
<p>
Hope is good, but negative outcomes still do happen sometimes too

I wouldn&#39;t give up too quick.  Assuming you didn&#39;t suffer massive nerve damage and still have sensation, then you may need to experiment more.   Digital stimulation isn&#39;t enough for many women.  I haven&#39;t even had srs yet and need a vibe.

For what’s it’s worth, I have great depth but it doesn’t make much difference, I can’t orgasm through sex, only when I’m alone and able to concentrate. I’m four years in and it’s definitely an evolution.

I understand to some extent. Ppl should let you say how you feel. It took multiple surgeries to get a semi functional results and now I can only have sex with fingers or smaller penis. I’m looking into another one and it’s really tiring when you’re trying to get FFS and other surgeries and just live your life. I will say I am able to orgasm so for the most part I’m still sexually satisfied. Had I not been able to? I think I’d regret the surgery too.

It took me 8 months to have an organism. Then it took a while for it to get good. I know many girls that took a year.  I know it&#39;s hard, but be patient, it takes time to heal and learn about your new parts.

<p>
For depth, you can consider a revision at some point.

I feel you with loss of depth. At the 7 months mark I only had 3.5 cm of depth and was on the second smallest dilator. Had surgery last week to get it back up to 5 cm. I&#39;ve been crying a lot they week because of the lack of depth and width. It almost feels like dilation is just pointless at this point. Dilation still hurts like hell every day.

Wish you well gaining the aesthetic result functionality you desire. You’ve got me thinking that I really need to evaluate what the various outcomes of surgery could be and do some “what if” scenarios as part of the decision making process to proceed. I tend to idealise the surgical outcome as a sure thing where in reality it might well be different.

I understand you&#39;re feeling. I&#39;ve had my regrets. It&#39;s not really because I don&#39;t have depth. I have good results as far as to please a man.  I don&#39;t have very good results in terms of being able to orgasm. I just accepted it as a risk consequence.

this is one of my hesitations about GCS. I already have a hardish time orgasming on HRT (though not at all impossible) and I have 0 experience pleasing a pussy. I worry that it would be hard on my relationship if my bf wasn’t able to make me cum for 9-16 months or whatever. I do enjoy being able to have multiple orgasms in a row tho. that part of HRT is great. im almost debating having my surgeon leave more penis so my clit has a better chance of retaining nerves. I also like that my surgeon retains foreskin which helps a lot in stimulation (and keeping the glans healthy and sensitive)

Try PRP injections to the area, it may not work, but it might.

This is the first I&#39;ve heard of PRP for GRS. I had it dune for a torn bicep tendon. Usually, it&#39;s for an area with little blood flow. Do you have info on this?

I worked in a med spa, we had a couple patients come in for prp injections to aid with normal vaginal function. If I remember correctly they where having issues with sex, pain and dryness being the main issue. Prp injections helped them regain normal function

Very interesting. I don&#39;t quite understand how this works. I was told that PRP works for areas with limited blood supply, like tendons. The vaginal area is rich in blood supply.

Sure that’s one application. You can also use prp to microneedle, you can use it to help in the treatment of scars, you can use it to help speed up healing during a hair transplant I can go on.

This is a really crappy question to ask someone struggling with stuff, especially with no indication that they&#39;re open to answering it.

<p>
I&#39;m in a similar boat to the OP, and the truth is I can&#39;t have the sex I want, and it makes me self conscious and makes dating even harder than it already is. This question is basically rubbing salt in the wound

Piggybacking off of the androgen gel idea: I&#39;ve also heard of Dr. Powers&#39; &#34;scream cream&#34;. Might be worth checking for the ingredients at
<a href="/r/DrWillPowers" rel="nofollow">r/DrWillPowers</a>
and seeing if you can get something similar compounded.

I feel you and I am sorry about what happened to you. I read you did SRS with Dr. Kamol?
</p>
<p>
If so, wait at least 18-24 months for a complete healing and after that, I would definitely advice a complete revision with Dr. Burin. He is also specialized in revision surgery, depending on the case of course.

How do you lose you depth though? It&#39;s not just lost.  Its  lost because of failure to maintain dilation?  Or do i thought

I haven&#39;t managed to orgasm after mine either but I&#39;m only 3 months or so.

I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the fault of the PPT technique (I&#39;ve met many girls who have had this technique and are happy with their results), that would be the fault of the doctor who did your SRS
