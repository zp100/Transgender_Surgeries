Intro
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hey all. I posted back in April after my Facialteam consultation and armed with my VFFS pictures and asking for advice; I was nervous, excited, unsure what procedures I should investigate... and 100+ comments later, I still had no idea!
</p>
<p>
This is one part AMA, one part photo gallery, one part price breakdown of Facialteam&#39;s costs. I&#39;ll pre-empt a few of the questions I think people will ask. Feel free to DM me as well.

<strong>
Why FFS?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I started HRT beginning of October 2020: 3 pumps of gel + Decapeptyl GnRH. Within six months I started to research into FFS; I knew I could expect to see some facial changes with HRT a few years down the line, but I wouldn&#39;t see any adjustment to my bone structure. I decided to book in a Skype consultation with Facialteam, and fortunately they had space for me within a week, aiming to book in surgery in November 2021.
</p>
<p>
My brow, chin and jawline were major sources of dysphoria for me. I remember around the age of 20/21 starting to feel more aware of the effects of puberty, and as I approached my egg moment (May 2020 at age 26) I knew I had to act. I knew that if I decided to put off surgery for a few years to see how things went, I would still probably want FFS in the end anyway.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Why did you chose Facialteam?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Their consultation is free, that helped! They have a lot of blog posts and resources and demystified their process. FFS isn&#39;t exactly a simple procedure, and it&#39;s not obvious what the results will be.
</p>
<p>
I live in the UK and Marbella in Spain is a couple of hours flight for me and inexpensive to reach. It also felt like I could combine a mini holiday into the trip and bring my partner along for the ride.
</p>
<p>
It was actually quite hard to find many negative stories and usually they were small issues, and some complaints with technique (they don&#39;t like to perform hairline advancement for instance). The idea that they&#39;re &#39;conservative&#39; came up a lot too, but as you&#39;ll see, I think they were quite aggressive with my jawline and chin.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, with COVID restrictions as they were, travelling from the UK to Spain wasn&#39;t difficult, whereas if I wanted to visit the USA for Deschamps-Braly there was no chance ofs doing so.

<strong>
How was the surgery?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Really smooth. FT arrange a taxi to and from the hospital (10-15 minutes away). I get to meet the rhinoplasty surgeon, the anesthetist and ask both of them lots of increasingly
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/8wOtgQz">anxiety riddled questions.
</a>
</p>
<p>
The night before surgery I was nervous, scared, hopeful, excited. An inevitable sensation swept over me, I had to remind myself why I was doing this, despite not knowing entirely what the outcome could look like.
</p>
<p>
I slept well, surprisingly.
</p>
<p>
Arriving at the hospital at 7.15AM, I undressed and fumbled around with my gown. I was wheeled downstairs, jump onto a bed to have my IV put in (twice). I&#39;m wheeled into a room besides the main operating theatre--my heart pounding so loud I can hear it--and see all my pre-op photos printed out big on the wall (a bit like I&#39;m entering a stalkers lair). Suddenly---
</p>
<p>
---it&#39;s 8 hours later and I&#39;m awake again, being prodded over and over again in the head with, presumably, tweezers for the hair transplant. Now I&#39;m under local anaesthesia: I&#39;m really thirsty; my lips are dry and chapped; my lower back and arse aches from being motionless on a bed for so long.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I feel my heartrate elevate, I would hear that mirrored by the machine next to me. Because I was under local now, I would feel the IV rush more delightful pain-numbing drugs into my veins, and my vision would brighten and frost over. I didn&#39;t feel any pain at all, but it was all very unusual.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I&#39;m there for a couple hours before being wheeled back to my hospital room. The remnant hallucinations from GA dancing around whenever I closed my eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Is it painful?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes and no. Imagine stubbing your toe... it&#39;s sort of like that, but for 3 solid days. It&#39;s between a 1 out of 10 and a 5 out of 10 pain level depending on how recently painkillers were administered. They only give you strong IV paracetamol for the first few days, then you move onto ibuprofen and paracetamol. I wouldn&#39;t say it was hugely painful but more uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
The rhinoplasty means you can&#39;t breathe through your nose (at all) because your nose is full of blood and other gunk. Because of the jaw and chin surgery my entire mouth is numb, making my lips swollen and cracked. Breathing through my mouth makes my lips even more chapped, dry and irritated. It makes eating hard because I couldn&#39;t breathe, every mouthful cuts off my airflow.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 0-1: wasn&#39;t too bad, a little uncomfortable.
</li>
<li>
Day 1-5: was pretty tough, unable to breathe and unable to eat easily.
</li>
<li>
Day 6-7: energy is coming back, able to take longer walks, and breathe ever so slightly.
</li>
<li>
Day 7: I can breathe, suddenly, and it&#39;s AMAZING: being able to eat food easily (and smell it!), taking strain off my sore, dry chapped lips.
</li>
<li>
Day 7-14: walking gets easier, eating gets easier, I&#39;m able to do a little work
</li>
<li>
Day 14-21: maintaining the transplant and keeping everything clean is my job, I can work from home easily
</li>
<li>
Day 21-31: back to working out and about (probably too early for doctors orders, but I feel up to the task)
</li>
<li>
Day 31-today (12/12/21): able to eat pretty much anything I want again, hard and chewy foods pose little issue, still have a little restriction opening my jaw
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
How is facial dysphoria, has healing gone well?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had no idea how much emotional and physical stress my facial dysphoria caused me until it was gone. Looking at my face every day and being unable to comprehend the person I saw looking back; pre-op with the right lighting, the right hair position, the right mood I could possibly feel confident, but it was getting harder and harder to ignore.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 0 post-op: despite the bandages, the swelling, the discomfort: I felt free. I was suddenly able to look at my reflection without that wave of inertia.
</li>
<li>
Day 1-7 post-op: Swelling is pretty controlled considering how much I had done. My reflection is unusual, a bit surreal, and delightful all at once.
</li>
<li>
Day 8-21 post-op: Swelling is at its peak, and has made my face look like there&#39;s been nothing done to it. I&#39;m starting to hyper-focus on some of my facial features, I&#39;m wondering if it was all worth it. I look at my old photos of my face and feel a bit sad. With my new perspective, I look at my old photos and think: &#34;I&#39;d probably be attracted to that scared looking boy.&#34; If I had a time machine...
</li>
<li>
Day 21-32 post-op: Swelling starts to subside and I rejoice. A very strange thing: my mirror image doesn&#39;t look much different to me, but whenever I see myself in photos it&#39;s a surprise to see this femme person in them. It&#39;s like my mental map of my own face hasn&#39;t quite updated, and I need a bit more time for my brain to rewire itself. Overall I&#39;m super happy with my new profile and the results seem to revealing themselves every day.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any surprises?
</p>
<p>
The one thing I didn&#39;t feel like I needed to change about my face was my nose. When Facialteam offered me a rhinoplasty, I was on the fence. They told me my nose was neutral, but when my brow and jawline were reduced, my nose would not be in proportion to my face.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/mpnfbb/transfemme_just_had_my_facialteam_ffs_consult/">When I posted on /r/asktransgender about this
</a>
, a lot of people told me &#34;don&#39;t let them touch your nose&#34;. I was still undecided on my nose weeks before surgery. In the end, I decided: fuck it, let&#39;s just do it in one and hope for the best. I&#39;m glad I did.
</p>
<p>
The nose I&#39;ve got now, even early on in the healing process, is delightful. It&#39;s one of my favourite things about FFS. Another big bonus feature: they also sorted out my shitty airway and deviated septum.
</p>
<p>
I had no idea how poorly I was breathing every day until FFS Day 7. The first time I could breathe again was so clear, so fresh, so clean, so deep... it was almost painful.
</p>
<p>
Pre-op: I would often wake up during the night with a dry throat, by morning I would have a horribly itchy, fizzy nose that I needed to blow constantly. I would have allergies that would make me sneeze all the time.
</p>
<p>
Post-op: I sleep really well, my dust allergies seem to be almost entirely gone, I&#39;m able to breath really well. It&#39;s actually one of the biggest bonuses I hadn&#39;t anticipated of FFS.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Overall
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The next 12 months of healing are going to be super interesting and it gives me so much hope. My anxiety is at an all time low, and my facial dysphoria is massively reduced. Facialteam have been lovely, they all put a lot of effort into making sure you&#39;re comfortable, answering questions quickly and reassuring me throughout the entire process. It has been a really positive experience.
</p>
<p>
I know this was a super long post, so feel free to ask any questions and I&#39;ll do my best to answer them. If you want to reach out via DM that&#39;s okay too.
</p>
<p>
Thanks all! 🌈

Hey! Amazing write up and awesome results! :)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for surgery with facial team in 5 months time (forehead and chin) and it really eases my anxiety to read walkthroughs like this.
</p>
<p>
I was just wondering, do you have answers to some of the `anxiety riddled questions` you linked to? Specifically the questions about waking up mid surgery and speech problems after chinplasty.

Okay so, good news on the first one: hospitals have amazing drugs and you have an anesthesiologist dedicated to your intubation throughout the entire surgery.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll barely remember going under. Important to remember that you will wake up during the simultaneous hair transplant (if you&#39;re having) and that can be a bit odd, but the local anesthesia will be very dreamy and it won&#39;t hurt.
</p>
<p>
Speech problems: I have only noticed an issue with my high end pitch, I think this is due in part to intubation and swelling around my trachea (thyroid cartilage reduction). I&#39;ve seen improvements in the last couple weeks and will monitor this.
</p>
<p>
My lower lip has been numb and swollen for a month, but I haven&#39;t noticed any major speech issues. YMMV ofc

Ok amazing, thanks for answering :)
</p>
<p>
Last questions,
</p>
<p>
Were there any risks of skin slackness after chin and jaw work?
</p>
<p>
I assume you have to wear a chin strap? How long and often?
</p>
<p>
Did you do any of the group therapy stuff they organise at facial team? If so what was it like?

<p>
I had a pretty decent amount of bone taken off my chin and jaw, so I&#39;ve been graced with a lot of loose skin and swelling in that area, causing a double chin. It should hopefully clear up within 1-6 months.
</p>
<p>
It depends on your age, typically under 50s will see increased skin elasticity.
</p>
<p>
You should wear the chin strap 24/7 for at least 4 weeks, however it&#39;s recommended you wear it while sleeping during the night for at least 6 weeks, possibly more if you&#39;ve still got double chin issues.
</p>
<p>
I did try joining the group therapy sessions, but nobody was around for the sessions when I was free. I did talk to the psychologist, but I didn&#39;t really vibe with her, she felt pretty rushed and like she wasn&#39;t listening. I was fortunate to have my partner and a friend on Discord who had been through FT already that I could vent to.

Reading the post 3mo after, still one of the best posts to clarify a ton of things. I&#39;m in the US and I&#39;ve had the virtual consultation with FT about a month ago, they told me the situation with my jaw is a bit complicated so I should go there in person to do the scans and talk it in more detail, which is a possibility (I&#39;m from Europe originally after all) but a bit expensive.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask you a question meanwhile? Do they do the VFFS just out of the pictures or do they do the scans first?
</p>
<p>
Thanks again for the extra useful post and best of luck for everything

Hello, sorry for jumping in two weeks later. Just to confirm the VFFS is included in the consultations in Spain and also our Orientation events for specific countries (online).
</p>
<p>
The CT scans are not usually required for the VFFS and can be performed at our centers (included free of charge).
</p>
<p>
Thanks to everyone here for great advice and great questions. These threads are indeed very helpful for many people as there are so many details to consider.

You could potentially get the CT scans done locally if that&#39;s a possibility and send the DICOM file over to them, but a sunny holiday to the Spanish coast is always a delight.
</p>
<p>
They made the VFFS from the photos I emailed over. I sent around a dozen photos. I didn&#39;t expect a visualisation, so it was a surprise to see one!

How do you judge your VFFS based on your final post-op results ?

Happy for you, great results. I&#39;m also 27 and living in Europe, but I&#39;m thinking about FFS in Russia or Thailand, as Facialteam has prices that I would never be able to afford.

Thank you so much for the amazing write up! As for your deviated septum and breathing issues pre-op and how your surgeon was able to help with that. Was that something you discussed with their team before hand, did you specifically request it or did it come up in the interviews?
</p>
<p>
I have very similar issues and am looking at booking with facial team in (probably) a few years and I’d love to know if I could get my breathing issues dealt with at the same time without requiring another surgery. Thanks!

I was just chatting to the rhinoplasty surgeon and this came up, I had no idea and it wasn&#39;t something I even knew was a problem.
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s basic maintenance on their side, they&#39;ll be in there anyway, so might as well fix any major asymmetries and blockages!

Thank you. It&#39;s going well so far.

Submental incision just below the chin. There&#39;s a little bit of a lump where the skin has swollen, but it&#39;s not really visible and is well hidden.

It&#39;s understandable: it&#39;s a lot of time, money and energy.
</p>
<p>
Both surgeons will hopefully offer a great result, and both have
<em>
literally
</em>
written the book on FFS.
</p>
<p>
For me, I could have flipped a coin. Pricing is pretty similar between FT and DB, with DB edging out slightly more expensive in some ways. If you&#39;re geographically located closer to DB or FT.
</p>
<p>
I think if you want sliding genioplasty and hairline advancement, you&#39;re probably better with DB, but this will be entirely down to your facial anatomy and what your pre-operative CT&#39;s say

One of the main things driving my decision is how soon I can get in. DB won&#39;t have me in until Jan 2023 where FacialTeam can have me in by the end of March 2022.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in the US too.
</p>
<p>
But I don&#39;t think I can wait a year to start my life. I&#39;m honestly a mess and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll make it to next January.

I had consultations with both Deschamps and Facial Team.
</p>
<p>
They both made me feel a lot more comfortable but Deschamps team and office were the most impressive ever seen.
</p>
<p>
He is also the most.impressive person I&#39;ve ever met.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen before and after from both and Deschamps had better results for people with my gestures. I had a prominent jaw, etc.
</p>
<p>
Additionally Facial Team has a team of surgeons so their consistency is often quite varied depending on who is doing what and I haven&#39;t liked their results as of late.
</p>
<p>
The only real issue is Dr. Deschamps cost like 75k and FT is like 35k.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s... Kinda shitty having to spend that much. I&#39;m admittedly bitter about that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m 16 days post op from Deschamps and I haven&#39;t been misgendered since the surgery. And it&#39;s looking better every day.

Sure I can share photos.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d also like to shoot that if money isn&#39;t a concern then meeting in person is 100x better than any remote bullshit. I&#39;m loaded and even my lazy ass was moved for this.
</p>
<p>
As for noses... I got shared some literature by surgeons. It&#39;s mostly because noses are more subjective. Noit because surgeons mess up - but because no one is ever happy with results.
</p>
<p>
Even if the results are outlined before surgery.

I really love how natural, subtle yet very feminizing their work on your face is. It seems like the recovery was also uneventful. How&#39;s your sensation?

Thank you, I&#39;m pleased with the result so far, I need to keep an open mind on final results for at least another 12-18 months, but so far so good!
</p>
<p>
FT&#39;s little adjustments have hit the reset button on what puberty did over 10-15 years. Its given HRT a blank slate to do its magic over the next 3-5 years. I&#39;m only 1 year on HRT and have only started to get some facial changes anyway, right now I&#39;m a bit more androgynous teen aha.
</p>
<p>
Recovery was pretty uneventful. No bruising at all apart from my eyelids, swelling has been pretty controlled. I did ding my nose with a face mask and that caused some extra swelling and bruising that looks a bit like a dorsal hump. It&#39;ll go down eventually.
</p>
<p>
Sensation: lower lip has mostly come back. My chin is still numb but I get more and more feeling every day. You barely notice it.
</p>
<p>
The crown and around the top of my head is still quite numb. Most days my head feels like loads of buzzy warm electricity is pulsing through it with all the nerves reconnecting. It&#39;s quite nice really!

This is so interesting! Your eyes on the before/pre surgery pictures nearly exactly look like mine right now! Even the slightly higher right brow is the same 😅 Planning on getting FFS with facialteam in the end of this year. Now I know how it might look like. That&#39;s incredible :0

Hey :)
</p>
<p>
Would you mind doing a followup post? Nothing elaborate, just a recent neutral pic to compare to pre-op
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m scheduled for FT in Feb, but am worried they are conservative and yours seem not so conservative. I think in the last year they are reacting to all the &#39;conservative&#39; reputation they have been getting and have been more dramatic in the last year.

Thank you so much for this post ! Looking at your photos ,while it is possible to notice (befor and after)  a big difference in your chin and jaw , I don&#39;t see any difference in your Adam&#39;s apple befor and after. Did you do Adam&#39;s apple reduction? ..

Wow, thank you for this, it&#39;s really descriptive and helpful. I am having my ffs with facialteam in exactly three weeks now, excited, nervous, trying to start packing for the trip, coming from Canada. My daughter will be my companion.  I had a similar discussion about the nose; they had listed it as optional in my quote, but I asked, and all their surgeons (like three of them) told me on skype that my nose did not necessarily need feminizing. I decided to leave it out, and may get it later on.  I am getting practically everything else though, from the SHT, forehead reconstruction, brow, lip lift, chin, trachea.  You look amazing. Have you a more recent update, like a two year pic?  That would be nice.  Thanks again, take care.  Lilly Grace
