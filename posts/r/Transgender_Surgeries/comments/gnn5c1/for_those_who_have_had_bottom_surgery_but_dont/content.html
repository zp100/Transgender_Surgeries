How do you get up the courage to go through with the surgery if you don’t have a lot of bottom dysphoria ? I want to get the courage to go through with it but I have a hard time because I just want a  vagina but I don’t have much of a problem with my penis

I still had bottom surgery despite not having much dysphoria - I got it for very practical reasons (clothing, pain during sex because of erections). However, I was surprised at just
<em>
how much better
</em>
it made me feel about my body overall. Looking down and seeing what&#39;s
<em>
supposed
</em>
to be there is just this continuous source of joy.

I think genital dysphoria can be one of the hardest things to suss out because of how much of a drastic change it is. Like with FFS, you can get virtual FFS and have a pretty decent estimate of how you might look afterwards, and how you look afterwards usually still looks like &#34;you&#34;, just a more female-looking version of &#34;you&#34;. And your face still feels like a face, things still smell the same way after a rhinoplasty, etc.
</p>
<p>
But trying to really picture how it
<em>
feels
</em>
to have a vulva and vagina after being stuck with the other thing your entire life? I mean, maybe I&#39;m in the minority here, but it was pretty hard for me to do that. And if you&#39;re the kind of person who has a high pain tolerance, sometimes it can be hard to understand how much pain you were actually in until it&#39;s alleviated.

That&#39;s a really interesting outlook. I go back and forth between wanting SRS and not. I am really scared of the permanency of it. What if afterwards I realize that I liked my penis better? It&#39;s scary stuff.

It&#39;s definitely a terrifying prospect. There were a few things that helped me work through those fears, though:
</p>
<p>
1) looking for examples of trans women who had true &#34;I want my penis back&#34; regret - like, had a perfectly good outcome and still hated it - and seeing how they wound up on the path to getting surgery
</p>
<p>
2) Making a list of pros and cons for both getting the surgery, and not getting the surgery.
</p>
<p>
3) Doing a lot of introspection and a deep dive analysis into why you feel the way you do.
</p>
<p>
The first is (AFAICT) *extremely rare* - like, I&#39;ve even seen some people who said &#34;I think I liked having a penis better&#34; ultimately say that the benefits outweighed that feeling. The second I think really helps you get a better idea of what you want out of the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The last one I think probably helped most of all. Because I have pretty significant anxiety, and so I tend to overthink
<em>
everything
</em>
- like, I experience hesitation about any semi-permanent choice, even when it may not matter in the grand scheme of things. And part of my anxiety about this was the possibility that there was going to be some major improvement/advancement in the available techniques (like eliminating dilation), and I didn&#39;t want to commit in case something better came along.  I also remembered how much uncertainty I had when I first decided to transition, and how that disappeared almost immediately once I actually started.
</p>
<p>
And then I though back to pre-transition sex with my girlfriend of the time, and not only how absurdly dysphoric it made me feel, but also that intense, seething jealousy I felt the entire time I was doing it; I also realized that I had literally not made a single attempt at dating since transitioning and shot down any offer that came my way, because I really didn&#39;t like picturing sex involving it in any way. And I realized that there was something about a really, really good tuck that I liked beyond not having to worry about it falling out, and that half the time I was tucking in scenarios where there was no point (literally sitting alone by myself).
</p>
<p>
Like, there are a million signs that start tipping the scales pretty clearly in the direction of &#34;no, I&#39;m probably not deluding myself due to societal expectations&#34;. But I think most of all, it was the fact that although I was otherwise &#34;done&#34; with transition, I didn&#39;t *feel* like I was done. If that makes any sense.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a scientist, so that&#39;s what helped me: going through my life and feelings with a fine tooth comb, picking out the relevant bits and organizing everything into discrete concepts, and then analyzing that evidence. Basically, deconstructing my anxiety and filtering out the noise to find a signal. As I did that more and more, it became clearer and clearer that the preponderance of evidence was pointing to an obvious conclusion.
</p>
<p>
I can say that if you&#39;re not 100% certain about it, chances are there&#39;s nothing that will ever make you 100% certain about it. But if you really make a dedicated effort to introspect and analyze yourself as a person, I think it is possible to eliminate a decent amount of the uncertainty and give yourself confidence that you&#39;re making the right choice

Thank you for the long response my trans sister! You&#39;ve given me a lot to think on. I am also quite anxious and thought about transition everyday for a couple years before getting started, so I figure it will be the same thing for SRS if I do get it. I&#39;m still on the fence about FFS or even a boob job so we&#39;ll see how it goes haha

<p>
I mostly said f-it, it&#39;s a journey, it&#39;s going somewhere new and different, it&#39;s resolving ~50 years of unresolved issues, so off I went. It was a very surreal morning, about 6 am, hanging around this huge atrium intake area for surgery, waiting to be called, and not really believing it was finally about to happen. Very surreal.

I had spoken to (I think) five M2F post ops prior to surgery. Three had less than desirable outcomes, so that was a concern.

I was a little nervous but not too bad. Try to remember that at the end of the day, nearly everyone survives this surgery, it&#39;s really rare for someone in the care of a competent surgeon to have anything truly life-threatening happen. Women around the world have children every day and tbh that&#39;s probably
<em>
way more dangerous
</em>
than GRS. Make sure to have people who will support you around, and you&#39;ll get through it.

In the interest of fairness, not all of us find having a vagina troublesome. The first year, and especially the first few months, can be a bit trying. But by six months I was back to normal life (including PIV sex), aside from dilating. I&#39;m over a year post-op now and, aside from dilating once or twice a week, I rarely think about it. My body just feels normal to me now. But I had massive genital dysphoria too, so perhaps it&#39;s not an apt comparison.

I&#39;ve never once looked down and thought &#34;Fuck, that was a mistake.&#34; Like, not even a little bit. I&#39;ve never had a single shred of regret, or questioned whether it was the right thing to do.

That&#39;s exactly how I felt and my main reason for getting it!

And with that being said, I still don&#39;t know which path I would believe is better

Mine was Chettawut, and I believe he did a fantastic job, and people tell my I have great results. But it&#39;s just the nature of the neovagina that trouble me
</p>
<p>
In all fairness, I&#39;m only 4 months post op so perhaps in a year like other post-op people, I&#39;ll feel better about it. But the complications I&#39;ve had have been extremely trying mentally and physically

<p>
I definitely don&#39;t speak about my experience to discourage anyone at all

Never feeling safe is a good reason. Whatever it takes to make you happy, and living in fear is not a good thing.

Clearly you shouldn’t, but going by the voting pattern here it appears others don’t agree.
</p>
<p>
Personally I’d do it because I want to, and that’s arguably even less reason. Luckily I don’t care what anyone else thinks.

What are you, the vagina gatekeeper of christmas past? Why do you think you have the right or authority to tell multiple people on this thread their reasons for wanting SRS are invalid? Are you just trolling or are you a TERF?

Do you experience dysphoria about not having a vagina, rather than about having a penis?  Would you prefer to keep your penis but also have a vagina?  If so, I think it would be worth looking into penile-preservation vaginoplasty (also referred to as “nonbinary vaginoplasty”, although you don’t need to be nonbinary to choose this surgery), which basically removes your scrotum and replaces it with labia and a vagina without removing your penis.  The vaginal canal can be created using tissue from the scrotum, colon, etc., rather than from the penis.  There have been several posts about it in this sub.   Because you would be leaving more of the original tissue intact, it is a somewhat less invasive surgery and so, I believe, has fewer associated risks.

According to this sub’s wiki, Dr. Heidi Wittenberg, Dr. Thomas Satterwhite, Dr. Curtis Crane, and maybe Dr. Ivan Aguilar offer it.  You can see more about this in the wiki (scroll down to the “nonbinary srs” heading):

Obviously it’s much more nuanced than that, but I’ll just delete the comment if it bothered you.

I dunno, I guess I just wanted it and wasn&#39;t that afraid of doing it.

If it&#39;s something you want, and you&#39;re willing to do the work that it requires, then just decide that it&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do and do it.

I was one of those women who thought I didn&#39;t have much dysphoria with my P, but once I had bottom surgery, it became very apparent just how much dysphoria I had and how much energy I put in every day just to deal with it. I literally avoided dating because of my anxiety on that area. I distinctly remember seeing an pre-op photo of myself and it was instantly clear to me how wrong it looked.
</p>
<p>
For the first time I feel sexy, my body looks &#34;correct&#34;, overall I am much more confident and happier with my life. I&#39;m only three months out and it is already one of the best decisions I made.

I didnt have genital disphoria, but still had my bottom surgery. I think I for me it was super important to make my life easier. Locker rooms, swimming, sex, explaining myself.... That&#39;s all reasons that come from outside, rather than doing it just for myself.  I find it really hard to find out, if transitioning steps are for me or for everyone around me. Tbh I think I did bottom surgery to be more accepted and it worked. Kind of sad, but its true. My self confidence got so much better afterwards

Just make sure you 100 percent want it for yourself before you schedule. I have met too many trans girls who got grs because they felt pressured to as a trans girl who really wish they didnt after. Basically, just make sure it&#39;s your decision and not others or environment pressuring you.

Can you elaborate on what happened a little more?  Were they being pressured into doing it because it was just &#34;the next thing&#34; to do?  Did they not feel like they could take their time deciding?  What happened after?

So I&#39;m speaking for others here so I&#39;ll only give what I&#39;ve heard. It&#39;s good to note that for the most part they are cool with having a vagina. It&#39;s just that they really cant say if it was worth it. They felt like they needed it to be see as more valid by others which now looking back at is ridiculous. Basically the few peeps I&#39;ve talk to said they property wouldn&#39;t do it again if they went back in time because having it or not having it doesn&#39;t make a difference when it comes to being &#34;valid&#34;.  Note none of them had heavy genital dysphoria and were cool with having a dick. I just dont think anyone should do something that isn&#39;t for themselves. Grs is a hell of a recovery, so it&#39;s not something that&#39;s anyone should do until they are ready.

its interesting to hear some people regret it....i don&#39;t think i would regret it because having a penis is such a big burden, you always have to explain yourself and you have this secret

Yes, this is so important.  Would be awful to go through all that srs requires only to regret it afterwards.  Be sure it’s what you really want before going through with it!

A little, yes.  I m pretty much at home in operating rooms, as somebody who did a job in relation to surgeries, etc.  However, I still get that sinking feeling in my stomach when I am wheeled into such a room.  I think it is pretty normal and reflects the fear of not knowing what to expect, and being out of control. So, you are not alone with being scared, we all have this feeling!
