I&#39;m suffering. This is my first surgery and I am so uncomfortable. Tell me it gets easier? That things will be better when they take out my packing? I can&#39;t get a good position to sleep in and I cannot bear thinking theres another 3 days of this. I just don&#39;t want to be attached to things anymore. I hope I can pee and don&#39;t need a catheter when i get back to the hotel. I wanna be back home and just getting stronger and I pray to god that dilation will be okay. I wish I could just sleep it all off but I can&#39;t and eating is hard too. It&#39;s just so difficult to do or think about other things when this is there. I constantly feel like I need to pee but I can&#39;t and I need to drink more water as well.

It is like being sick. Noone notices the moment or even day when they go from being to not sick.  It just slowly dismisses until forgotten.
</p>
<p>
The first week for me sucked.  I approached it like a marathon, getting whatever rest I could, eating high protein diet, drinking plenty of water, and trying to keep my brain occupied to pass the minutes. It passes.
</p>
<p>
Then the first month of carefully moving around, keeping to the dilation schedule, and so on...another marathon.
</p>
<p>
It sucks.  But you suffer now so she doesn&#39;t have to later.  It is an investment into a future where your current misery is a distant memory.  You are just taking the long way around to get there.  You can do this.

Oh it eventually gets a lot easier.  The first few weeks tend to be a bit of trial by fire but once the pack is out and your able to move around a bit the difficulty tends to ease up a bit.
</p>
<p>
Just keep your eyes on the prize and be kind to yourself, you got this!!!!

Thank you for your affirmation. I am so done with the packing and just then they put a clip on my urine catheter, supposedly so I can try peeing myself. I&#39;m still not sure how that will work

You&#39;re doing awesome. Just focus on getting stronger üòÅ
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know know much about that clip option. I was content with the cather and frankly sometimes I&#39;m like &#34;dang that was just way to convenient, but I&#39;m weird like that üòÖ

Congrats on the op! There likely will be difficult moments, but it most definitely will improve. I found the biggest relief came when the catheter was removed. The catheter caused me more problems and discomfort than anything else in that first week!

Drinking water is really important in that first week. Maybe ask if they have any squash or something you could put in the water to encourage you to drink it? :) or a hot drink?

Sounds like I have something to look forward to. They just clipped up my cathether and I&#39;m not sure what that&#39;s for but I hope to get it out when I can.

I know it&#39;s hard, but things will get better in time. Try to rest and drink plenty of water too. The packing does suck,but it fill feel a lot better when it come out.
</p>
<p>
Everybody hate the catheter, and i was never so glad to get it out. With it, it felt like my bladder was full and i needed to pee all the time. When it comes to peeing, you just need to relax.

Girl be grateful that you only have it for 3 more days .  I had to keep in the catheter and the vacuum bag or whatever for 8 days. My back hurt, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, literally every night I only slept 2 hours . Having to do number 2 was uncomfortable , it was just annoying . After that, sleep was so much better !! It gets better girl just be patient!!! Why really helped me sleep was narcos because it knocked me out completely lol hopefully you have some with you, I‚Äôd take some before sleep to make things easier :) I‚Äôm about 3 months post op and I can say I‚Äôm back to everything 100% . People heal differently, but I hope your recovery goes smooth :)
