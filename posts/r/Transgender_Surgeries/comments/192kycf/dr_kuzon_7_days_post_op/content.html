Congrats! I&#39;ll be following since he would probably be who I go to since he&#39;s the closest. I have my letters and need to set up a consultation.  Still on the fence, mostly because of my age. I&#39;d love to hear more about your experience. It&#39;s really hard to find his results, but I think you look pretty good to me. Again, congrats!!!

Thank you! Honestly part of why I wanted to share was because I&#39;d had such a hard time finding his results myself lol. Ended up learning a lot through word of mouth from other trans folks in the area. If you ever have any questions you want answered, please feel free to ask.
