Day 2 - Awoke feeling extremely rested. Tried having another bowel movement and was able to very slightly, but not entirely. It still felt relieving enough though. Ordered some breakfast and got a good meal in me. Pretty soon after that Dr. Hyer and one of the resident nurses entered my room and asked if I was ready to remove my dressing. I was a bit nervous but I knew it was time. They both helped remove the dressing and there was blood, but Dr. Hyer said it was a normal amount and it looked fine. She seemed very content with the appearance of everything and informed me that it looked really good. She was still very optimistic about my recovery. She also removed my drain, and that... was quite the feeling. I&#39;m not even sure how to describe it haha. It felt very odd, but it didn&#39;t last long. She took a photo for me to look at and I was very happy with it. At this point I was able to see the flatness of the area down there for the first time! It was such a euphoric feeling!! They left after going over some details with me about being discharged and at-home care.
</p>
<p>
The nurse came in a little later and brought discharge papers and such. I signed them as I felt okay enough to be discharged. After signing them, I had to wait until my girlfriend arrived to be taken home. At this point I was told I need to try walking again. This felt... daunting, to say the least. The nurse brought me a walking cane and I walked around the front of my bed once. I immediately got severely light-headed and lied down again. It was very difficult to be honest because of how little I had used my legs, and feeling the blood rush to my head all at once. I rested for about an hour and drank plenty of fluids before trying again. At this point, my girlfriend had arrived as I was attempting to walk again. I did better this time, and got a little further, but the lightheaded-ness came back really fast so I lied down some more. When I felt ready again, my girlfriend and I got me dressed to be discharged. I opted in to be wheeled down as I couldn&#39;t handle walking that far without getting lightheaded. I was discharged around 1PM.
</p>
<p>
Getting into the car to ride home was a bit of a challenge, but thankfully the donut pillow I got helped tremendously. It definitely wasn&#39;t an enjoyable ride home but it had to be done; home was roughly an hour away from the hospital. Once we got home, I slowly walked inside the house and into my room and immediately lied down as I was exhausted from all this spent energy. It was the most I had moved since surgery and my energy levels were struggling to keep up. I ate a small meal and then slept for like 2hrs. For some reason, after that nap and some more pain meds, I had the biggest burst of energy I had since surgery. I finally put on some underwear filled with gauze fluff over the surgery site, and it helped soo much. I was able to walk around entirely without getting lightheaded and walked around quite a bit! Hence the photo I took in the mirror! That was the first time I looked at myself in the mirror and saw the flatness again. The euphoria was unreal. My girlfriend felt a little uneasy at how much energy I had, so she told me to not push it and lie back down to rest. Which I thought was a smart idea, so I did.
</p>
<p>
At this point I felt my energy levels dipping and chose to sleep for the night. Sleeping once again felt amazing, and I probably got like ~8hrs of sleep. I had to get up twice during the night to drain my catheter and take some more pain meds, but it was still a wonderful night of sleep back home in my own bed. Bleeding today was pretty spotty again, very normal amounts. Pain today never went over a 4/10.
</p>
<p>
Day 3 - Awoke feeling really rested again and feeling good. Checked my underwear for blood and it looked normal as usual. No concerns at all. Ate a small breakfast and began my meds again. Morning was pretty chill and my girlfriend and I were kind of hanging out for the most part. I tried having another bowel movement, and once again got a little out but not a full BM. I had taken some stool softeners too, but it seems my poop is being stubborn haha. After that, I stayed resting with occasional walking to prevent blood clotting. Walking today has been significantly easier and its been great to be able to move around more freely.
</p>
<p>
Finally showered since surgery today too. The shower ended up being quite an effort as by the end of it I was getting really lightheaded and almost passed out. Feeling the water rinse over the surgery site was such an intense sensation that my body didn&#39;t know what to do. It wasn&#39;t painful, but it was very overwhelming. I pretty much just cleaned the surgery site with some Hibiclens and water in my peri bottle, and then rinsed the site with runoff water. Also cleaned my armpits and back as those had gotten very sweaty over the past few days. Dried off and immediately went back to bed to rest for a bit. Pain around this time was pushing a 5/10 and I was really exhausted again. After resting a bit and some pain meds, pain was back down to a 2/10.
</p>
<p>
Final notes - That&#39;s about all I can write about currently. Overall, my hospital stay was very pleasant despite the struggles because of the attentive and caring nurses and staff. Seeing Dr. Hyer each day was a joy as she felt like a very caring presence to be around. It feels really good to be back home and knowing my recovery is going so well. I&#39;m very optimistic about the process and feeling good.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll be doing another update hopefully Mon/Tues after removing my packing and catheter and beginning dilation on Monday. So keep an eye out! Feel free to leave any questions on this post if I missed anything you want to hear about! &lt;3

Day 0 - Surgery was at 730AM and finished at ~1045AM. Awoke being wheeled to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), very out of it and not knowing what was happening. Fell asleep. Awoke again VERY thirsty and pretty much began hydrating myself as much as I could. Had a very kind nurse who was very attentive and helpful. Was in the PACU until ~430PM as there were no rooms available until then.
</p>
<p>
Upon arriving at my room, I was transferred from one bed to the other using a slide board. This wasn&#39;t super comfortable but it needed to be done. Upon being finally in my room, and seeing my girlfriend again for the first time since the beginning of the surgery, I immediately cried as she held me. It was a very emotional moment and I was very happy to see her again. I then relaxed for a bit until I was given my initial medications. Everything was going well until I was given oxycodone, and I had an awful nauseating reaction that pretty much made my evening/night hellish. I was constantly dizzy, similar to how motion sickness feels, and barely able to function outside of drinking water. I tried eating but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to eat much. It would come in waves and eventually, I ended up throwing up a lot and all the food/water I was able to get down. I felt very weak and out of it for most of that evening/night. Upon realizing the oxy meds were causing this, I told my nurses I no longer wanted any as it was too much of a detriment. My girlfriend was very concerned as well because I was just so out of it and constantly groaning.
</p>
<p>
That night was also very rough in terms of resting/sleeping. I probably got ~2hrs of sleep as I was still really out of it because of the oxy, constantly being woken up for meds and vitals, and just general discomfort. I also was having discomfort due to my bladder being so full from how much I was hydrating and urinating. I had to have the nurse come help me drain my catheter a lot as it was struggling to drain consistently. Eventually I found a routine that I would do for ~20min draining the tube into the bag. Pain was pretty low though, roughly 1/10, with just a lot of pressure on the surgery site. Awoke at one point during the night with a decent amount of bleeding, but nothing was oversaturated to the point of concern. Very normal amount of bleeding. Nurse changed my pad during the night.
</p>
<p>
Day 1 - Morning was very tiring as I got little to no sleep. Continued to have my nurse and CNA check on me for meds and vitals. They offered me a separate opioid called &#34;dilaudid&#34; that was much less nauseating than the oxycodone. I was very hesitant and denied it at first as I didn&#39;t want to experience the nausea I did the day prior again. It was too much. My girlfriend pretty much kept me entertained for most of the day and we took a few naps here and there. Things were very good and relaxing for most of the day, pain was still staying at a 2/10. Was eating regularly again, which felt good considering my body had pretty much only been surviving off of water and some saltine crackers. Tried having my first bowel movement but was unable to. Was finally passing gas though, which was relieving.
</p>
<p>
Around 5PM that evening, my pain began skyrocketing breaching an 8/10 and I was unsure what was happening. I figured the oxy&#39;s had fully worn off and I was beginning to regain sensation in the area. It was very difficult to manage the pain and ended up opting in for the dilaudid opioid. It was MUCH more helpful than the oxycodone by a longshot. It helped bring my pain back down to a 4/10 and was able to finally relax and also not get nauseated. Had a really filling dinner that night and was able to finally get some sleep too. Probably got ~6hrs of sleep that night and it was one of the best sleeps I ever had. I got awoken a few times to check my IV fluids bag and for vitals, but I was able to immediately fall back asleep.
</p>
<p>
Pain ended up returning to a 2/10 again and the night flew by. Didn&#39;t even wake up at all to empty my catheter I was so tired. This day was a much better day and I felt optimistic. Bleeding was still very minimal and not concerning, still nothing close to excessive saturation around my dressing. Good day and night overall.

This is a reposting from back in November of 2022. I&#39;m primarily doing this as I wanted to separate my other account from surgery related things. Thanks!
