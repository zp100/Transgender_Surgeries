I had surgery a little over 2 weeks at BMC with Oates and Slama. I’m happy to answer any questions but will also try and give an overview below.
</p>
<p>
Overall I’m very happy with my vagina so far. I can go all the way to the last dot on the first dilator - but am having trouble getting past the 1st dot on the 2nd dilator. I seem to have very good sensation in my clit and everyone who has seen my vag has said they think it looks great.
</p>
<p>
PROs of surgery here: you don’t have to quit HRT beforehand, they just put u on a blood thinner You get epidural before surgery and 2-3 days afterward so pain is virtually non existent.  By like 8 days post op I was just taking Tylenol for pain like once a day.  As a nurse I love a teaching hospital and I felt supported in everything and felt as though everyone on my team even all of the residents were committed to my care and comfort.
</p>
<p>
CONS: I know they strap your arms down for all surgeries but I guess for this it’s so long and so tight that my arms were killing me when I woke up in pacu. And still today I have a bit of pain in extending them out. My hands were also completely numb for 2 days. Gradually improved and was full sensation before I discharged but it was a PITA. I could barely text or brush my teeth bc of it.  Again with the length of surgery. 7 hours on my back in one position... I got a stage 1 pressure ulcer on my sacrum. It’s still present currently and sometimes hurts but it has improved. I’m hoping it goes away soon. This really upset me. I know it’s a long surgery but I feel they should be able to do passive range of motion on ur arms and reposition you a little at least.  I stayed here for my FFS in 2016 and everyone was amazing all the nurses and techs I loved. Wasn’t as fortunate this time. I had some really great nurses sometimes. Hated my discharge nurse he was a prick. Discharged me home without ensuring my pain medication would be filled no problem and wouldn’t give me something for the ride home. When I later called him bc I couldn’t get the script filled he was rude AF to me. He was like u need to have them call each other and not have me be the middle man (the pharmacies) I’m like listen u cunt I can’t have them call each other if u don’t give me the freaking number!!! Also, my first night out of pacu the nurse tech rolled up in my room w airpods on on the phone talking about inappropriate stuff and I was pissed AF. Food was better than I imagined, but the food person wouldn’t read me all the options on the menu. She’d give me 2 and I’d have to pick and when my food would come it would show there were several more options I could have chosen from which I felt like wasn’t right.
</p>
<p>
The doctors are amazing. I like my results. Just wasn’t super happy about the hospital stay but tis life I guess.
</p>
<p>
Also, I logged into my insurance portal to see if I could find the cost: I’m assuming this is for hospital stay &amp; everything - $42k

Thats really well done and looks realisitic! I&#39;d really like to ask though what was it like being called into the OR? Were you originally put in a hospital room, put under, then transported, or did you get to the room and they put you under while still nude and properly prepped?
</p>
<p>
How was waking up too! I&#39;ve honestly only had bad experiences with anestestics and waking up afterwards (IE vomit from gas and my body reactionarally fighting it), so I&#39;m personally a bit afraid with my FFS and SRS surgeries.
</p>
<p>
Theres one more question though, and I really want to ask, emotionally, how do you feel about finally getting the surgery? Are you confident, or still getting used to the lack of the weight and everything...I&#39;m kinda really afraid that if I get srs before I find a partner who accepts me, it&#39;ll be harder to find that person and I won&#39;t really be loved.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d love to one day have a body that doesnt make me feel bad, but I want a family more than anything.

Ok first I went to pre-op. They put u in a gown naked underneath. Put a bair hugger on your (warming blanket) start your IV ask questions, take your vitals. Anesthesia came and talked to me and both the surgeons separately. Anesthesia gave me my epidural and something to relax me. Then they took my bed to the OR. There were SOOO many people in there. I was like yes bitch! I’m hereeee hahaha. They put me over on the operating table. Strapped my arms down asked me what music I wanted played and put the oxygen mask on me - that’s the last thing I remember.
</p>
<p>
I have had a lot of bad experiences after anesthesia also, BUT since finding out the gas is what makes me sick I just tell them I get really sick and ask them to ONLY give me propofol and since then I’ve not gotten sick any. I woke up no problem. My hands were just numb!
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t sure how I’d feel after but the next morning when I got up and started sending pics to friends and selfies everyone was like omfg u are glowing. And my bf has told me daily how much happier I look. I think I had more bottom dysphoria than I realized!
</p>
<p>
I felt the same way about not finding someone but for me my happiness is more important than what someone wants from my body. Xoxox

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE RESPONSE,
</p>
<p>
Honestly reading this gives me hope, thank you so much for using the medical termenology, my family is that of trauma nurses, mostly registered nurses actually, but this really clears up some of the process for this center (and probably others too!)
</p>
<p>
This is amazing, and I hope you find you heal very well and get all the depth &amp; sensation you can. Thank you so much again!

Wow this is actually one of the best results I&#39;ve seen, especially for 2 weeks. I live in Boston which makes this even more interesting to me. I was planning to travel to Avanessian or McGinn, but maybe I will check them out.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m kind of nervous about going to BMC though. I&#39;m a pharmacist and I have some friends that are pharmacists and nurses that work at BMC. Once they know, a lot more people will quickly find out because people love to gossip (I know HIPAA exists, but realistically people love to talk, especially about &#34;omg can you believe so and so is trans!?&#34;). Oh well, I guess it&#39;s time they found out.

Aw ty! Like the majority of the work I’ve seen of theirs I’ve thought was good tbh. And I understand. I’m a nurse and we have had patients be Jane doe before to protect their privacy for similar circumstances. Shouldn’t hurt to consult!
