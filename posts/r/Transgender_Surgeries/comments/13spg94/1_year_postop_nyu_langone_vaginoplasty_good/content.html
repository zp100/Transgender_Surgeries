<p>
Throwaway because I don&#39;t like mentioning too many personal details on my main account
</p>
<p>
My wife and I are both trans women and both got our vaginoplasties done at NYU Langone by Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao about a year ago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Electrolysis
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We both got electrolysis for over a year. Each of us got about 1 hour per week a piece. It wasn&#39;t too bad. We both had high pain tolerances, numbing cream, and a good electrologist. NYU cleared me at my pre-op about 18 months before the surgery. I still continued getting electrolysis anyway to be safe. They recommended my wife continue electrolysis which she did. We both had similar levels of clearance by the day of our surgery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Week before surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We did the laxative treatment NYU wanted. I did fine but my wife was pretty much glued to the toilet for a couple days. They told her to take less when we called and asked. Since our surgeries were scheduled on the same day, we told them I wanted to go first and my wife wanted to go second. They said they could do that. We got a call a day before the surgery and were told it would be the other way around.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Day of surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Wife&#39;s surgery took less than 90 minutes. I don&#39;t know how long mine was. Wife later told me she was misgendered in the PACU by the transport aid. When she mentioned this to a nurse, they apologized profusely and multiple higher-ups in the department asked for more detail and promised they would improve their training.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The hospital stay
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I set my hospital room&#39;s temperature to 67 but it never got below 75. I was constantly asking the nurse for more cold packs. When I tried to shower for the first time, the drain was clogged and I had to stop prematurely to not flood the bathroom. I had to stay an extra day at the hospital because of bleeding at Dr. Zhao&#39;s recommendation.
</p>
<p>
My wife doesn&#39;t respond to opiate painkillers, for some reason. She kept asking them for Aleve instead of opiates but they refused to deviate from the standard painkiller regiment. She described herself as being in 11/10 pain throughout the first couple days. It wasn&#39;t until my mom started kicking up a storm for her, Dr. Bluebond-Langner allowed her to take Aleve. The antibiotic IV caused her to get intense diarrhea. Whenever they would bring in a new course, she would get panic attacks. She still has some trauma about IVs because of this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Staying in New York for a month
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I had some issues with blood clots and hematomas at the incision site. I was told to massage the area manually express any clots that were willing to come out. At this point, my left labia started separating near the vaginal canal. When I asked about this a post-op, they said there was nothing to worry about and it would heal in the right place. When I saw the pelvic floor physical therapist, all she did was ask me a questionnaire I could&#39;ve filled out online then told me her next available appointment was in 2 months. Since I don&#39;t live in New York, I obviously didn&#39;t go back.
</p>
<p>
My wife didn&#39;t have many issues with recovery at this point. The pelvic floor PT she saw was more helpful and provided advice she brought back to me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery at home
</strong>
</p>
<p>
After spending nearly 10 hours at LGA due to flight delays, we were finally home.
</p>
<p>
My labia that separated a bit did not heal in the right place so now my labia are asymmetric. It still looks cis enough to please me though.
</p>
<p>
By this point, my wife lost her clitoral hood. We guess the stitches holding it together popped off prematurely. She also was having painful dilation with some smell. By this point, my wife was concerned she might have some hair in her vaginal canal but we weren&#39;t sure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
3 Month Follow-up
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We mentioned our concerns, my labia and her clitorial hood. They reassured me my labia should look normal when the swelling goes down. For my wife, they scheduled a revision surgery at the 9 month mark to restore her clitoral hood. During the exam, they said they couldn&#39;t see any hair in her vaginal canal and neither of us had granulation tissue.
</p>
<p>
A couple weeks later, my wife was having an issue that was consistent with what we have read about granulation tissue on here. We called and asked. They said it couldn&#39;t be granulation tissue since they didn&#39;t see it at the post-op. After pushing back some, they prescribed some ointments to put on the dilator. These ointments cleared up whatever it was.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
6 Month Follow-up and disillusionment with NYU
</strong>
</p>
<p>
By this point, my swelling had gone down enough I was confident the asymmetric labia was not from swelling, but from separation. Likewise, my wife was confident there was hair in her vaginal canal.
</p>
<p>
At my follow-up, Dr. Bluebond-Langner said it didn&#39;t look like it had separated but instead looked like excess skin she could remove in a revision. I wasn&#39;t particularly interested. I was getting pretty sick and tired of travel at this point. She said if I ever changed my mind to let them know and we could get it addressed. After the follow up, I checked my early recovery photos and could see the labia was attached at one point and got more separated each week for the first month or two.
</p>
<p>
For my wife, the nurses and Dr. Bluebond-Langner insisted they didn&#39;t see any hair in her vaginal canal. She thought they were wrong. To reassure my wife there was no hair in there, we bought some speculums and a high-powered flashlight. I looked inside and I immediately saw hair. It was so obvious I don&#39;t know how NYU could&#39;ve possibly missed it. We asked our electrologist if she&#39;d be willing to give it a shot removing them and she was. I just bought her some speciality supplies like clear speculums, extra long tweezers, high-powered flashlights. With me helping her by shining the light wherever she needed it and helping her find hairs, our electrologist was able to remove most of the hairs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Revision Surgery
</strong>
</p>
<p>
At the pre-op for the revision surgery, we mentioned we found hairs by looking at it ourselves and we&#39;ve been having our electrologist address it. The nurses didn&#39;t say much beyond &#34;okay&#34; and &#34;we don&#39;t recommend our patients perform their own exams.&#34; During the revision surgery, Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao performed an exam and claimed they didn&#39;t see any hairs and even if there were hairs, there would be nothing they could do. She had just gotten electrolysis a couple days before so perhaps there was nothing there this time.
</p>
<p>
My wife got her clitoral hood restored and she is much happier with her results now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
1 Year Follow-Up
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We had to move away from our hometown for career reasons and due to the increasing hostility towards trans people by the Republican-led state. Unfortunately, my wife still has a couple hairs left in her vaginal canal. (Though, much less than just 6 months ago.)
</p>
<p>
Since moving is expensive, I asked NYU if our 1-year follow up could be virtual. They said no so I said we couldn&#39;t make it. One of the nurses called me and asked for more explanation. As a summary of our conversation,
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I asked what percentage of patients have issues at the 1-year mark. She refused to say anything more than &#34;some&#34;.
</li>
<li>
I asked how can we trust NYU to notice issues we might have that we&#39;re unaware of if you couldn&#39;t even see the hairs in my wife&#39;s vaginal canal at the 3, 6, or 9 month mark. She said they might notice an issue this time.
</li>
<li>
I asked how can we trust NYU to take issues we bring up seriously when you shrugged off the vaginal hairs and said I was wrong about my labia separating. She didn&#39;t have a response.
</li>
<li>
I asked if we did go, would NYU have a plan to address the vaginal hairs my wife still has since our old electrologist lives halfway across the country. She said they could see what they could do at the follow-up. I said that I wanted a more detailed plan. She said she&#39;d ask Dr. Bluebond-Langner and get back to me.
</li>
<li>
I asked why would it be a better use of our time to fly to NYC for a &#34;maybe we could do something&#34; when we could instead fly back to our hometown to definitely be able to get the issue addressed. She didn&#39;t have a response besides continuity of care.
</li>
<li>
I asked why has this phone call been longer than any post-op I had at NYU and why does it feel like we&#39;re only be listened to now that we are talking about canceling an appointment. She apologized that we felt this way.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A couple days later, the nurse called back and told me Dr. Bluebond-Langner recommended my wife continue getting electrolysis, but there probably wasn&#39;t anything they could do at the post-op, but perhaps there was another issue they could find. I thanked her for her time and told her we wouldn&#39;t be going to the 1 year post-op as flying back to our hometown to get electrolysis and finding a trans-friendly gyno where we now live seems like a better use of our finances and time. She said she&#39;d let Dr. Bluebond-Langner and Dr. Zhao know and if we changed our minds, we could always have another appointment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Summary (tl;dr)
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Both of our hospital stays were not great. (My recovery room not being great. She was misgendered and they adhered too strictly to prescription painkillers rather than letting her take an OTC painkiller.)
</p>
<p>
We both had complications with our results. One of my labia separated and now hangs a higher than intended. My wife had hair in her vaginal canal and lost her clitoral hood. NYU insisted we were wrong about all of this except the clitoral hood which they did a revision to fix. My wife had to get electrolysis in her vaginal canal to remove the hair NYU claimed she didn&#39;t have.
</p>
<p>
We are both happy with our results. Aesthetically, our vulvas look cis (even mine despite the labia separation). Functionally, everything works. And it&#39;s because we&#39;re happy with our results, we are so disappointed by NYU&#39;s lackluster post-op care.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to AMAA, I guess.

Hair removal is such a struggle and seems like even with x number of sessions its still not guaranteed to stop growing. I’m sorry for your complications.

Thanks for taking the time to share all of this. It&#39;s really obvious how much we have to advocate for ourselves even in an ostensibly friendly institution.

How was your wife’s surgery only 90 minutes? These surgeries usually take 5+ hours

NYU&#39;s surgery is robot assisted and they have two surgeons working at the same time. A plastic surgeon works on the vulva and entrance to the canal with scrotal and penile skin and a urologist reroutes the urethra and creates the back of the canal with peritoneal tissue. They told me the day of the surgery it normally takes 1.5 to 2.5 hours.

Yeah I get that, my surgeon was trained by BBL and uses the same method (robotic assisted with a urologist). Surgery still took 8-ish hours. That’s insane

RBLs average surgery time is 100 minutes nowadays so it&#39;s normal. Less time anesthetized the better!

Mine was 90 minutes &amp; I had a really fantastic result.  I asked my surgeon at the first post-op appointment and her explanation boiled down to &#34;sometimes it just works out like that.  everyone is different and some bodies just make it

easy.

It’s because they perform sooo many of these surgeries per year and have been doing it many years. The doctors at my local hospital for example take around 5 hours because they don’t do as many per year and have fewer years and experience under their belt.

It’s mostly because they have 2 surgeons working at the same time and the robot speeds it up a lot.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Zhao basically does all the inside work and Bluebond does the outside work/aesthetics

Yeah, we read so many positive experiences about them online which is why we were surprised by our experiences at the post-op’s and why I felt it was necessary to share =/

So sorry to hear you had this experience. I had surgery with Zhao and Levine in 2016 hospital staff was shady af but Zhao was always my hero even after the complications I had. I mean I thank him on the anniversary each year. Again sorry you both had such a bad experience.

We didn’t have much issue with Dr. Zhao. By our 3 month post-op, we both preferred him over Dr. Bluebond-Langner. While she constantly seemed rushed and we never really saw her for more than 30 seconds after the pre-op, he was calm, polite, and took his time to answer questions.
</p>
<p>
At the hospital, a couple days post-op, he came in to check on me while a nurse happened to be in the room. While we were chatting, I made an offhanded comment about running out of water shortly before he showed up. The nurse quickly started heading to my cup to refill it but he told her not to worry and went to refill it himself. He even got ice. That small act meant a surprising amount to me especially since surgeons are so busy.
</p>
<p>
(We also both geeked out a bit together about how cool robot-assisted surgery was which was fun.)

He truly is an amazing man. I have so much love and respect for him. I only met bluebond once and I hated how I was treated like a brand new patient to the hospital. All this fuss for her and she didn’t live up to the hype. Still can’t believe the surgery was 90 minutes.

I wish you had a better experience with Rachel and Dr Zhao. They&#39;re team performed my surgery in 2017. I had no issues with them or the staff at NYU Langone Hospital. Back then they didn&#39;t do PPT surgery. I am going back in October this year for that revision surgery.

For the main surgery, we were there a week ahead of time for some fun. We were only mandated to be there for a couple days ahead of time. After surgery, they wanted us within an hour of the hospital for three weeks.
</p>
<p>
For the revision surgery, we showed up a few days ahead of the surgery. Then, we stayed for a week.

Thanks for sharing all of this detail.  I&#39;m not sure what to make of the hair issue.  Were you upset that there was hair to be found because you were promised it would be addressed in surgery, or was it just that you felt gaslighted by being told they couldn&#39;t see it when you knew it was there?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m currently on the waiting list at NYU.  I suspect I won&#39;t even make it in given how far back in line I am.  But if so, how did you manage a whole month of living in NYC?  Was it just an AirBB lockout for a month?  How much would that cost?  My insurance will only offer an absurd reimbursement, like 50 bucks per day, which is a joke in NY.
</p>
<p>
Would you still recommend these providers despite having some disappointment with the process?

For the hair issue, the primary issue we had was being gaslighted about the hair. If they noticed the issue at 3 months when my wife first started feeling it, we would’ve had an additional 3 months of electrolysis we could’ve gotten for her before moving. Now, we’re probably going to have to fly back to our hometown once or twice to finish getting it addressed.
</p>
<p>
We were also pretty annoyed that they told us before our post-op’s “we’ll see what we can do” and getting there to hear “nothing we can do”. They tried to pull the same trick with the one year follow up which is why I pushed back so hard and said we’d only go if I was told an actionable plan to address the hairs.
</p>
<p>
We got a 5-bedroom brownstone in Brooklyn. I think it was around $12k but I reserved it pretty much immediately after the pre-op since COVID still had prices for travel depressed. We had a lot of family and friends who wanted to visit and help during recovery so we got a big place but only 2 people stayed the entire time. The others cycled weekly or so.
</p>
<p>
Our insurance policy was updated a couple weeks before our trip to include travel for medically necessary care you cannot obtain within 100 miles of home in response to Roe v. Wade being overturned. They reimbursed economy plane tickets for me and one helper and my wife and on helper. We each got a reimbursement of $50/day for patient and helper. This came out to $200/day total. Overall, I think about half of the brownstone was covered. We could’ve gone cheaper but having a big place for friends and family to stay at was helpful for us.
</p>
<p>
Recommending them is a difficult question to answer. They are still some of the top surgeons in the country and we’re happy with our results, just disappointed in the post-op care. I guess it depends if you’re willing to put your foot down to healthcare providers, tell them they’re wrong, and potentially fire them. We are so it’s fine, if very annoying, for us. But I have some friends who are more timid and might just accept these same complications and not do any further research because the doctor can’t be wrong. Though, this is probably relevant advice to any healthcare provider

Thank you for posting this review! It’s nice to see people provide honest experiences and not just the fluffy positive rainbows and sunshine side of NYU Langone. Obviously they are not a perfect institution and this review is helpful to me and so many other patients to know how to handle difficult situations like yours in the future.
</p>
<p>
The most important thing is that you didn’t come with life threatening complications (at least in the level of Rumer or Gallagher) which speaks very highly of the skills of the team but the internal hair issues I’m not surprised to hear about because it’s common for many GRS surgeons to sort of “gaslight” patients about internal hair issues (which is not okay to do by any means). This is exactly why it’s so important to clear ALL of your hairs, the time line most teams in the country give is ridiculous because hair grows in cycles and you have to prepare for the worst. Use the long wait times and waiting lists as a means to get your hair removal done throughly!

Exactly! I’m extremely thankful we didn’t have any severe complications. The complications we’ve had were surprisingly manageable.
</p>
<p>
I think I had been getting electrolysis for about 2-2.5 years before surgery and my wife had been getting it for 1.5-2 years. Her terminal hair was blonde which made it hard to see particularly when it was getting very sparse. My speculation is, during surgery, the surgeons didn’t see any remaining hair she had because it was blonde and sparse and failed to sufficiently follicle scrape. Of course, this is only speculation. I wasn’t in the OR to observe what they did.

I had surgery with them and had mild labia minora separation the first month due to some tissue dying and they agreed to do a labiaplasty revision after only 2 months post-op when I was healed enough so no idea why you got pushback.
</p>
<p>
Even with the issue my vagina looks pretty much cis and is pink inside, self lubricates, no nasty odor, has mucosa tissue instead of skin inside, is fully functional with no depth lose and dilating to full depth is easy and it’s probably better than 99% of results out there looks wise for a 1st surgery result. I would 1000000% go to Bluebond if I had the do the surgery again she’s the best in America IMO.
</p>
<p>
Besides the labia minora issue everything looks great, you can’t even really see the scars nowadays

I had a different surgeon, top rated surgeon too, but similar issues with post op care, except they ignored the canal shrinkage and vaginal spasms and I think they skipped some steps too. My canal rapidly shrank on myself and I got no answers as to what was going on until I saw another physician (they referred me to this physician but I had to chase them down to the referral and the issue was absolutely time sensitive) they’re taking care me now, but hate after some 600+ hours of painful dilation later and a LOT of ptsd. Idk what to think about it. I’m trying to just focus on the present but I still have to dilate every day which just reenforces the trauma. My depth is up in the air as of now. I think it’s getting better?
</p>
<p>
Getting lied to about my care was probably the worst part because now everything the surgeon says is suspect and I’m scared that I’m not getting proper care. I don’t get why surgeons think it’s ok to be dishonest with patients. Lies of omission are still lies. No one should ever lie about surgery.

Every surgeon is going to have complications occasionally. Any surgeon that tells you otherwise is a liar and you should run, not walk, away from them. Unfortunately, we were in that group that had complications. Despite this, we are still satisfied with our results. We are just disappointed with the post-op care.

I still think NYU Langone (IMO) is one of the best to do GRS; I don’t believe the OP’s intention was to dissuade anyone away from using them but provide value experiences for future patients to be aware of things like internal hairs and being able to properly advocate for our post-operative care. These testimonies are important and I want to say I’m extremely grateful for OPs insight!
</p>
<p>
Having said that, I’ve been doing research on most GRS surgeons and I’d say of all the surgeons with regards to aesthetic, complications rates, standard of care (both pre and post op) I put NYU Langone on top without a doubt. I am that dead serious about this; but also we have to acknowledge that it is impossible to have perfect care and expect perfection from every institution; so it is important to do your research, be as prepare if not over prepared for anything unexpected!

I agree completely with this statement. That was my intention and those are still my thoughts.
</p>
<p>
People just need to be realistic. At the end of the day, the NYU team are only people and very busy people at that. You need to be ready to advocate for yourself and/or get a second opinion if you believe your providers are wrong.
