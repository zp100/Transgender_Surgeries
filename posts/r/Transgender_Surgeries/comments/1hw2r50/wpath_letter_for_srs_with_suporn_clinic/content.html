So I have a date with the Suporn Clinic this year reserved, I got in contact with a highly recommended Australian psychiatrist to provide a WPATH letter, but as of yet today he has informed me he no longer wants does it for Suporn due to the difficulty in working with the Clinic.
</p>
<p>
This is because of what needs to be specifically written in the letter, he believes their requests are nonsense, unethical and unacceptable to most psychiatrists. Suporn says it’s because Thai laws, yet the psychiatrist says other Thai clinics accept Australian WPATH letters without question and has recommended going to a different clinic all together! Unfortunately I’ve always had my heart set on Suporn and already put down a deposit.
</p>
<p>
TLDR; Anyone else having difficulties with getting a WPATH letter for Suporn now?

Would you mind saying who the Australian psych is to help anyone else here looking to get letters.

Thanks. Do you have the clinics requirement, or it just what you heard from him?
</p>
<p>
I can understand he might have a problem with their paperwork, but I don&#39;t think its appropriate to recommend you go elsewhere on that basis.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s plenty of other psychs in Australia.

See my comment under this post. This is what he has told me not the clinic… If true I understand the wording Suporn wants could be seen as problematic for some, I think it’s just the psychiatrist though, sounds like he no longer wants anyone getting surgery overseas for whatever reason

I&#39;m pretty sure its not the role of the psych to influence or control your choice in surgeon, and in this particular case its especially inappropriate. Bank is arguably the best srs surgeon in the world, and Australian surgeons are very far from that. The psych&#39;s job is to say if your meet the psychological requirements for surgery.

Sounds like he is getting slack, he done my letter for the Suporn clinic with no issues with the clinic with wording just over 2 years ago, there is many online psych referrals worldwide that can do you up a letter for the clinic, someone I used to know who is in Australia got theirs done by some dude in the UK

Okay, looks like something has changed in the last 2 months or so… He seems to prefer Australian surgeons now or just not Suporn specifically

To quote the psychiatrist: “The Suporn clinic is now demanding that independent psychiatrists’ letters be amended and reworded to their requirements. This includes a requirement that I am directing you to have the surgery (which I am not) and requiring “certification” of 18 months of “mental wellness”, - which is a nonsense.”

I do not recall them requesting anything of the sort in my letter or the clinic requirements. Moreover, my letter didn&#39;t fully conform to their requirements and they still accepted it without issue.
</p>
<p>
Can you please post the requirements that the clinic sent you? They should have sent it in their email after you secured a date.
</p>
<p>
Unless those requirements have changed and the clinic has gotten more rigid in the past year... it sounds to me like your psychiatrist is the problem.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also confused why your psychiatrist is interacting directly with the clinic at all? Mine knew nothing of the clinic and there was no direct involvement between the two parties.

Definitely sounds like the psychiatrist is the problem the more people I speak to. The clinic have some things in their email but he’s added more things which may or may not be true. I’m just going to find some other psychiatrist now

Yeah they didn&#39;t ask anything about mental wellness and never asked for additional information since then (my surgery is in 3 months and I hope they don&#39;t because it was difficult enough to have my psychiatrist to do this letter)

I’ve done some more research and it seems to be this specific psychiatrist… Looks like other people have had difficulties with him as of recently… I wonder what changed. Going to try elsewhere now, just inconvenient and annoying

See if you can get a referral for Dr Michael Scott in NSW. I was able to get a WPATH Telehealth consult and acceptable letter to Suporn under bulk billing. Hopefully this is still the case.

I have an appointment booked with him in May that I booked a few months ago and this wasnt flagged then. Maybe its a new thing? Wondering if I should make alternative arrangements if this is his stance although you would hope that he would reach out to those affected if he didn&#39;t want to do it.
