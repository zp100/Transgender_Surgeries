I had surgery in September, had a surgical hematoma and some other complications. I&#39;m now 11 months post-op, I just sat down to take a poop -- as it is on most days since-- by the time I finished I am now bleeding from my vaginal canal. I don&#39;t know what to do anymore but I am out of hope that I will ever be comfortable.

Have you been following up with your doctor, and if not your surgeon,
<em>
any
</em>
doctor? Eleven months sounds way too long for recovery.

The surgeon doesn&#39;t care. That&#39;s the point. I have been having this issue because she will not consider how uncomfortable my life has been. I finally saw a new gynecologist who had a 3 month wait time today and was given the answer &#34;because you were in pain for so long following the complications with your surgery it is likely that you developed neuropathy that is causing your muscles to spasm and crank down and when they do that you&#39;re having tearing happen&#34;
</p>
<p>
So now I&#39;m gonna take a high dose of suppository Valium and mouth Amitriptyline  at night for the &#34;nerve bond to be severed&#34;, and a topical gel to heal the skin.

Fun times. Dont go to KU Med for GRS.

I’m sorry — that sucks. Maybe you should file a complaint with the state Board of Healing Arts (information at
<a href="http://www.ksbha.org/complaints.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.ksbha.org/complaints.shtml
</a>
) so hopefully this doesn’t happen to someone else.
