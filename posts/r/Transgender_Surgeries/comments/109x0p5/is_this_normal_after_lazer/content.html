I had pretty bad rash and strong irritation after my lazer session 7 days ago… This is still recovering.
</p>
<p>
My lazer person says it’s normal but I am really worried these are burns…
</p>
<p>
I am hyper-hydrating and doing all I can for care though but defo don’t want this to happen next time

Bleeding isn’t normal but scabbing and blistering is perfectly normal. It means the laser worked!

That to me is indicative of burning the skin. My laser tech uses a pretty hefty amount of cryogen when treating me -- if you&#39;re getting burns, the focus may be poorly adjusted leading to your laser tech having to adjust the intensity to compensate. Either way, you absolutely shouldn&#39;t be blistering.

Not an expert whatsoever, but this picture itself isn&#39;t necessarily concerning. I would expect it to be less irritated after 7 days, but if you tend to have sensitive skin perhaps that&#39;s it
</p>
<p>
I know I&#39;ve felt anxious before about laser damaging my skin and it&#39;s always cleared up fine. I&#39;d just keep taking as good care of it as you can, and maybe try to see a dermatologist if there really seems something wrong that isn&#39;t getting better?

If you do laser properly, you&#39;ll most likely have a fair amount of inflamed, red skin for a week or so afterwards. I think you could probably get away with it, though, by saying you&#39;ve been having trouble with irritation from shaving.
</p>
<p>
It doesn&#39;t look exactly the same, so if someone was suspicious and knew what they were looking for theoretically they might be able to tell
</p>
<p>
In my experience this is more or less what the redness looks like for several days afterwards - not exactly razor burn, but sorta:
<a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkmH9O93K_bd2voRKvHX72RrDwtc5lpsU2ow&amp;usqp=CAU" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkmH9O93K_bd2voRKvHX72RrDwtc5lpsU2ow&amp;usqp=CAU
</a>
</p>
<p>
Of course, worst case scenario (e.g. if you use too high a setting while your skin is tanned), you could get semi-permanent redness) or scarring, but I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that and it should be rare.

Probably? At least, insofar as it&#39;s possible to hide bad razor burn with makeup. I.e. with varying degrees of success.
</p>
<p>
FWIW, lots of cis guys get laser hair removal for their faces as well. Shaving sucks, lol, even for dudes. If anyone does ask (they probably won&#39;t), could you just say that?
</p>
<p>
Also, maybe you could do a test? Like, have the laser technician only do one small pulse on say, the skin under your chin where it&#39;s less visible. If you feel like you can deal with the redness it causes, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;d be okay with doing the rest of your face

Lol they kinda are burns. Lol. The thicker and darker the hair the more light is absorbed more light absorbed transmitts to heat and heat = ouch  this is why it hurts so much more in different places like the jaw line I figured was as tough as leather after shaving it 55yr and it is almost unbearable to the point of having a bite stick and I have a scrip for lidocaine they gave me. When you get in a thicker patch of corse hair each folical is literally burnt and killed it just happens so fasts that we really don&#39;t feel the magnitude of what&#39;s happening.  There is a few videos on YouTube that shows the process in supper slow motion and it literally looks like a lightning striking a tree and the hair literally explodes and it continues al the way down to the root of it all just like lighting a fuse on a firecracker.  So it is burns the trick is in the settings and that&#39;s why they ask you how it&#39;s feeling and should ask you if you had anything bother you at home like your asking about and they can turn it down a notch.  You don&#39;t want any blisters so it&#39;s a fine line between burning and irritation and ending up with blisters.

You can try zinc cream like Destin or Butt Paste that are uses for babies. It&#39;s really good for healing the skin. I was also recommended to take an antihistamine which can help with the skin irritation.

Super normal clears up in a few days usually without needing to do anything special. If it&#39;s uncomfortable you can apply some products to it, but up to you.

Yes it is normal to have redness on your skin after having Laser hair removal.
</p>
<p>
It will go away, any moisturizing cream to your affected areas and you&#39;ll be fine.

Oh and, the more sensitive your skin is the more it will react to the laser hair removal process.
</p>
<p>
If you are on HRT, as I am, your soft skin gets more red, but it will go away with using moisturizing cream.
</p>
<p>
Stay hydrated each day by drinking water, I drink 10 full glasses of water each day.
