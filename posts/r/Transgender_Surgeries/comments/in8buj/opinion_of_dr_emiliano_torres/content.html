Wanted to pose this question to reddit, as I&#39;ve heard almost NOTHING about him on Reddit, but people rave about him on the big FFS Facebook group and others. He seems very new, very transparent, super cheap Argentinian doctor, but maybe hasn&#39;t had enough patients for most people to recommend him. I see the same like 8 people all over his Instagram, the Facebook group, etc. Unsure, apparently is fantastic though? And all the results I HAVE seen are phenomenal and almost all are passing and beautiful.  Gonna schedule a video consult w him sometime soon, as he does do free consults, and I will report back to you guys how that goes! But just wanted to ask around here first, get as much info as possible.

I am a former patient of his. I should have been an easy girl as I didnâ€™t need much. I was completely botched by him going overboard. He did things to me that I told him not to. He has been gaslighting me ever since. One of the most mentally damaging experiences of my life. I say AVOID

Hey there, so I&#39;m planning to do my surgeries  with him, so far he seems legit but wondering also if you were able to get any extra information that you want to share.

Shifted my timetable much further away (especially w covid and stuff right now), getting bottom surgery first (in september!!!), then will look at finances and move toward ffs. So not gonna worry about consulting until then. Sorry I can&#39;t be more help. I would just recommend consulting as that will probably get you the most information.
