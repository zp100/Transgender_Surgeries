My girlfriend has only 5-6cm of depth. She&#39;s trying to get her medical records sent to another doctor but the doctor&#39;s office seems in capable of doing this and the hospital itself isn&#39;t returning her phone calls. Anyone know a lawyer in PA that might be interested in helping? We called one byt he didn&#39;t know any doctor&#39;s that had the necessary experience. I supposed for just getting the records we could use any lawyer? We&#39;re not really interested in suing the hospital but I have a feeling that&#39;s where this is headed.

No. We went to Dr Douglass and my partner lost nearly all of her depth before we even left Philadelphia. We are trying to find a doctor to do a revision and were having trouble getting her surgery records. We think it&#39;s being resolved now. Hopefully we don&#39;t have to do anything.

DonÂ´t know if you have seen it ...
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/further_resources/index#wiki_legal" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
might be some resources.

It may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here
</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic
</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/y0krwx/revision_expert/irsk9t5/" rel="nofollow">here
</a>
was also a discussion.

Have a look in the wiki for who the lawyers are suing Dr Kathy Rumer. She&#39;s in PA.

Thank you, I hadn&#39;t thought about that. It&#39;s a good idea.
