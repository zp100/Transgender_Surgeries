I’m interested in type 3 brow bone reduction surgery, but my plastic surgeon mentioned potential complications due to my prominent forehead. This makes me wonder if the concern is genuinely medical or related to insurance issues, like high compensation if something goes wrong, because he&#39;s operating as a hired surgeon in a hospital and not an independent contractor. It seems odd that many trans women can have this surgery, but it&#39;s deemed too risky for me.
</p>
<p>
Could anyone here provide more clarity on the actual risks and if there are other surgeons or methods that manage these complications better? I need to make an informed decision.
</p>
<p>
Best regards,

Sounds like he doesn&#39;t know how to do a proper type 3 forehead reduction.

Agreed. Type 1 is just bone contouring and apparently isn’t enough for most people. (Based on Braly-Deschamps’ book Facial Feminization Surgery.) If the surgeon only knows how to do Type 1, then it makes sense he would think it’s not doable.

This doesn’t make any sense. See another surgeon who specializes in FFS.

AFAIK the only time people would be ruled out from type 3 is when they have a congenital issue where there&#39;s no/insufficient sinus room for set back, but you can only discover that with a CT scan or, well, during surgery

Sounds like a skill issue to me. Find a surgeon who is confident they can do it, takes CT Scans prior to surgery, and has multiple FFS outcomes that you feel came out aesthetically pleasing. Anything less and you’re asking for a lot of potential problems that are harder to fix down the line than if they never happened at all. Just my 2¢ though!

I had a very similar brow bone. If not worse. I recommend checking my page for the outcome after FFS.
</p>
<p>
This could potentially be an insurance issue, but also just a doctor who can&#39;t provide you with what you&#39;re looking for.

I had a VERY prominent brow and never encountered anybody telling me it would cause issues. In fact, the FFS in my case ended up giving me a dramatically decreased forehead
