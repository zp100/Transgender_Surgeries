Not going to do a full write up rn. I&#39;m still definitely a bit out of it.
</p>
<p>
List of procedures: Scalp dvancement  Brow reconstruction (type 3) Rhinoplasty  Fat graft into lips Jaw and chin contouring (burring only, my chin height was already in the middle of cis range) Tracheal shave
</p>
<p>
Biggest annoyance is not being to breath from nose combined with hugely swollen lips (the pics really don&#39;t do them justice). My lips, mouth, and throat are constantly dry. Frequent aquaphor and sips of water help. Overall pain really isn&#39;t that bad, tonsilectomy was worse by far.

Damn, those are all the things I’ll need done. You know how much the cost was?

Dr DB is unfortunately really protective of his pricing structure so I can&#39;t say. I&#39;ll I will say is that it was significantly less than I was expecting and I think that&#39;s bc I didn&#39;t need any mandible or jaw cutting. The very rear we didn&#39;t touch, and the chin was burred to make it less square with the mid jaw contoured to match the new angle. I imagine this made my case significantly more simple and faster than someone getting everything else the same but with mandible contouring and T-line genioplasty.

I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll be in the exact same boat. My other consultation said I already have a cis-passing jaw/chin, but I expect whoever my surgeon is will recommend some shaving nevertheless. As far as his pricing, I&#39;m trying to decide if I can afford to borrow any money, as he&#39;s probably just outside the reach of my savings account (but likely worth it). Appreciate the feedback, and will be watching for your recovery updates!!!

By about two weeks I was just starting to feel kinda normal. Definitely more energy. I think it was around week 3 that I felt like myself again, albeit feeling delicate.

I think I only needed burring as well but thought the surgeon I went to in Antwerp knew what he was doing. I was very wrong, he is simply obsessed with cutting bones and loves to unnecessarily cut bones off the faces of his patients. Everyone gets the same surgical plan whatever your face is like. For him feminine means no bones and definition. A true artless and no sense of aesthetic clown with a scalpel.
