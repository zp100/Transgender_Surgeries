Hello, I am 3 months post op. 3 weeks ago I had a follow-up with my surgeon and he found granulation problem on very end of my vagina. My skin grew pulips, he cut them and treated with silver nitrate.  How unlucky I am that my gynecologist didn’t find them even after 3 visits I made to her during this time.
</p>
<p>
In 2 weeks I am visiting him again to check the recovery and probably to get silver nitrate once again.
</p>
<p>
He said we will need to do this periodically until granulation is gone. Otherwise, if it won’t get healed, he will recreate that part of vagina surgically using a new skin transplant. Which I really don’t want to do.
</p>
<p>
Bowers’ website states they have granulation in 7% cases: &gt;Granulation tissue (7%) is also fairly common and often follows wound separation. It is the body trying to heal itself but hurts and bleeds when touched. It can be very frustrating. Primary doctors treat this with silver nitrate but is best excised with scissors, then treated with silver nitrate.
</p>
<p>
So I wanted to ask if anyone had this problem inside vagina. What are my chances that silver nitrate will be enough? Shouldn’t we do it more often than once a month? I could do it myself at home everyday for example

I had some and it was cleared up after one treatment. The granulation tissue I had at the entrance has been much more stubborn, but nearly gone.
</p>
<p>
It’s really common, 7% seems like a very low percentage.

So the granulation inside vagina was healed after 1 treatment?
</p>
<p>
I had a little of blood today on my pad. And now a bit on a dilator after dilation. Normally I don’t bleed, last time I had blood 3 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Can this be a sign that my vaginal wall is not healed completely and I still have granulation problem?

You might still have some, but I wouldn’t worry about it too much. I’m a year out and still occasionally get a tiny bit of blood.

Thank you, Yuusui, you gave me some hope. I will meet my surgeon after New Year holidays. I really don’t want to have a second transplant, I am afraid it will be too difficult for me...

Granulation tissue is easily treated in most cases. It’s pretty rare that you would need surgery for it.
</p>
<p>
I found that KY jelly is quite bad for the skin and switched to a different lube and that helped a lot!

Wow, I actually use KY... I like that it’s thick and both liquid enough. I also tried today XY I purchased in Korea, which I liked as well, provably it’s the same...
</p>
<p>
Which lub do you use now?

Will also give a vote for Slippery Stuff Gel, that&#39;s my favorite lube for dilating

and
</em>
sex! I&#39;ve gone through a lot of it.

KY didn&#39;t works me as it&#39;s sticky! But few days on it, developed ulceration on clit... Coincidence or just it is really bad for some skin? Just dilating not sex because I&#39;m on the 3 months mark yet... But it goes up there anyway. Or maybe I&#39;m having another episode of i yeast nfection?

I had a small bit of hypegranulation right inside the entrance to my vaginal canal. My surgeon snipped it with scissors, treated with silver nitrate, and that took care of it. It did sting a bit, but it was quick and wasnt that bad.
