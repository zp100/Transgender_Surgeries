Hi everyone I am currently looking into booking a few consultations with surgeons for bottom surgery and I ran into some posts about Dr. Ramineni and the results look good! How‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs reviews of going to them for bottom surgery?

From my experience he can be intimidating for some based on how quickly he can move through consults. If you have any questions he will take the time to fully explain and work with you for your comfort.
</p>
<p>
My firat surgery was good, I had some issues with separation and bleeding and granulation which when I notified him of the issue he got me in asap for fixes and touch ups. And follow ups were scheduled by myself and he helped answer questions and concerns.
</p>
<p>
I did a revision as he likes to favor two stage surgery and got cosmetic work done (Added more visible labia and a clitoral hood, as well as readded depth as I lost mine at first due to not dilating.)
</p>
<p>
Since then it&#39;s been phenomenal, he does PIV with Scrotal Graft and I&#39;m able to self lubricate enough to have Penis in Vagina sex without needing lube.
</p>
<p>
He has had some patients with complications and those are very worth taking into consideration as well and make a choice that you are confident in. I would 100% recommend him.

Thank you so much for this! I‚Äôm excited but also nervous about it. But the clitoral hood you mentioned has me excited because I do want a piercing for that eventually when everything heals!

I cant find much on the alloderm alternative to revision. But i had a ZDV with ramineni that went great 2 years ago and so far the best sounding revision to get a canal is the alloderm which he talked about in my recent consultation with him.  Have you looked into this? If so, what did u find?

For the most part Dr. Ramineni gets very good results, ie sensation, depth, aesthetics, etc. Whatever is different about his technique makes it prone to fistulas, which are a bit of a nightmare complication (I‚Äôm a little over a month post op and dealing with one now).
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs something I knew about Ramineni and I sorta gambled and lost. It just depends on if you feel like being able to get in very quickly and get the surgery is worth taking that risk.
</p>
<p>
I do think he‚Äôs a good surgeon, I do think he cares about his patients, BUT if I had it to do over I would probably have gone somewhere else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hmm fistulas are a new one I haven‚Äôt heard much of in ANY bottom surgery. Could you elaborate a bit if you‚Äôre comfortable with that?

In this case, it refers to a rectovaginal fistula where there is basically a hole inside the vagina that leads to the rectum which allows poop to travel forward into the vagina. The primary treatment is to perform a colostomy (redirect poop to a hole in the abdomen called a stoma) and repair the hole in the vagina, then reverse the colostomy several months later.
</p>
<p>
They‚Äôre risk with any surgeon but for most the risk is well under 1% (eg. My surgeon has done over 300 vaginoplasties solo plus an additional 250 in training with 0 fistulas). Ramineni seems to have a much higher risk than most surgeons based on reddit. The usual cause of rv fistulas is damage to the rectum that occurs during surgery and isn‚Äôt noticed/treated in the spot (which can sometimes heal to the vagina walls instead of to itself.

He is a good surgeon who does a lot of vaginoplasties. Any surgeon who has not experienced a complication is not doing enough of them or not documenting them.  I feel terrible for anyone with complications from srs.  Even at best it is a brutal surgery and recovery.  He checks for rectal and bladder injuries with each surgery.  Complications are common with various fistula around 1% or less to dehiscense around 20 to 30%.  Post op care from a distance is difficult and far from ideal.  I don&#39;t think he is any better or worse than the popular surgeon&#39;s, rather people are very loud about Complications.  They are expected with this surgery and most people do not hear that at the consultation.

He has had multiple fistulas and serious infections in the past two years alone, and his aftercare or lack thereof has been frightening. He is quickly approaching Dr. Rumer territory in my opinion. I would never use him or recommend him to somebody I cared about.

I think you should try looking into Dr. Del Corral first

I&#39;m debating between Dr. Corral and Dr. Ramineni, and I came across reports of Dr. Corral stealing other surgeons results photos and claiming them as his own... I dont know how I feel about that
