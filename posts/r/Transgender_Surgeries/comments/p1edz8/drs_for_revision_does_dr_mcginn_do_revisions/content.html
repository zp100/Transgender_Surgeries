I had the same surgeon &amp; procedure as you (mid June) and I was wondering if you‚Äôd be willing to share any more info on what you‚Äôre going through? I want to make sure and look out for anything that could be problematic. :-/
</p>
<p>
It still early for me (8 weeks I think?) so I‚Äôm nowhere near final results‚Ä¶but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have my own concerns.
</p>
<p>
Dr. McGinn was always my plan for a revision if anything aesthetically went wrong‚Ä¶so fingers crossed that she does revisions.

Yeah of course! My labia minora on one side are gone at the bottom, and faded to gone on the bottom on the other. And I have no coverage of my clitoris with my clitoral hood unfortunately. I‚Äôd also probably want clitoris touched up in general. Internally I‚Äôm fine, I‚Äôm happy with that, clitoral sensation is poor but I‚Äôll be worried at 6 months if it doesn‚Äôt improve. So I‚Äôm not too concerned, most girls get revisions, I just wanted to be sure my internal part was what I wanted and it‚Äôs for the most part okay. I mean I wish I had a clitoral hood the actually was a hood but it is what it is unfortunately haha.

Thanks so much for the reply! I haven‚Äôt encountered the labia issues (yet?), but I‚Äôm definitely concerned about similar things with the clitoral hood / clitoris. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll cover more / some as the swelling goes down.
</p>
<p>
The internal part also seems fine for me, so I guess a cosmetic revision wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing in the world. :)

Thanks so much for replying!

Hopefully you won‚Äôt, the labia issue on one side is probably my fault (I went back to work at 6 weeks), the labia on the other side faded well before then though üòÖ. And yeah of course!

I haven‚Äôt had a revision, but I know she does them. There was a girl getting a revision the morning I had my surgery. Best bet is to contact her office and ask for a consultation.

I havent had a revision, I havent had SRS yet, but I have been in contact with McGinns office about revisions because I wanted to go there if I needed one. They have told me that they do them. The team is super friendly and Im actually switching my surgeon to McGinn.
