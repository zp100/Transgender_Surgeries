Where do I go to get support for how miserable my surgical results have been? My clitoris is fused underneath skin. My labia are completely numb. I can’t orgasm. My vaginal canal still hurts. My depth is 7 cm and I can’t fit in any but the petite dilators below the starting purple soul source dilator. I feel trapped with the surgery and nothing turned out well. My therapist isn’t helping me cope with it at all. Everyone I talk to is just uncomfortable talking about the surgery. I don’t know what to do. I hate regretting the surgery. I hate that I can’t orgasm. I hate feeling 126 days of pain and there are so many things that need to be fixed. I have to start all over with depth and width. Is there support groups for people who regret there surgical outcomes? I feel so alone in this. I’m miserable. I’m waiting for things to get better but week 10 is identical to week 18. Changes stopped a long time ago. Help! Suggestions welcomed. What do I do?

I know it&#39;s hard and your are obviously not happy with your result, I have been through it as well..
</p>
<p>
The one thing I can say for certain is that I gradually stopped caring. Yes it still bothers me that I can&#39;t climax but I can forget about sex for weeks on end now, I have almost no desire to be intimate with my partner apart from cuddles and kisses. The thought of her or anyone going anywhere near my groin kicks off my anxiety, fight or fight response :/
</p>
<p>
The problem you have is that you still need to dilate what you have to try and maintain it. You can&#39;t just forget about it.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to suggest other than try to take you mind off it. Investigate a revision but try to stay busy doing things that don&#39;t revolve around your groin.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry this happened to you,  huge big sister hugs x

I&#39;m pre-op and I feel the same way about my genitalia.

Mine got worse post op. Constant pain, it&#39;s completely non functional and it looks a mess so I&#39;m significantly worse off than pre op.
</p>
<p>
Choose you surgeon carefully.

sorry you are going through this after your surgery &lt;3 it will sound odd, but 18 weeks is still pretty early days for GRS recovery, and the period between about 3 - 8 months was in my experience a long and emotionally difficult plateau.
</p>
<p>
if your clitoris is really buried and you have lost a lot of depth, you may need to consider a revision. if you think there is a problem with your surgeon, it is possible to have a revision elsewhere. i&#39;m sorry if this is a bit demoralising, but revisions are very common even if we would prefer to be one-and-done.

I&#39;m 15 weeks postop and still no orgasm. My last follow-up was yesterday, and I was told it may be another year before I can orgasm.  In the meantime,  I&#39;m just going to keep trying.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t speak to the rest of it, but it takes a long, long time to fully recover from bottom surgery.

Dr Hyer at Denver health. The worst part is she doesn’t know what happened to make all these problems. She at first tried to gaslight me and say 7cm is more then enough for penetrative sex. She said she can’t fix anything until the end of the year.

Sounds like you might need a revision did you fall behind on your dilations?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s super important you listen to your doctor&#39;s post surgery care of the site and follow their guidance.
</p>
<p>
Speak with your doctor on where to go from here.

The surgeon “installed” 15 cm during surgery. Then when she removed the packing it was 50% gone magically and she doesn’t know what happened. I lost the depth before I even got to start dilating. I’ve dilated above and beyond the dilation schedule and it’s been no use. Still at 7.5cm

Some friends of mine needed almost a year until the nerves were okay. No orgasms after 18 weeks is definitely still fine.
</p>
<p>
The depth is debatable. The average depth of a cis vagina is about 13 cm. What method was used?

PIV. I hate that I had the surgery and I hate regretting it and hating it. I don’t know how to cope with it yet. Clitoris fused completely under numb skin. Labia not connected to the introitus. No depth. No width. My width struggles to accommodate a finger. It hurts to dilate and I’m stuck dilating with the petite dilators and can’t get half way to one dot. I have to spend so much more money to fix things and I’ll get to restart the pain clock and need to clear my life again. It’s all been for nothing at the moment. I hate how my surgical team has treated me. I hate hate all of it and I’m not coping well.

I live thousands of miles from Thailand and already paid thousands and thousands of dollars for this. It’s hard to clear the schedule for the length of time this takes and it’s hard to constantly produce large sums of money. I shouldn’t have gotten the surgery and I regret it and I hate regretting it. Things are unbearable.

Its unfortunate but not surprising that most surgeons do a one step procedure. In a two step procedure, the big work is dine first and then 3 or so months later, a second surgery deals with creating more detail. There is good news though, The first big traumatic step is done. You got your vulva/vagina. You need a revision to clean up issues from your first surgery. I think a lot of people, likely the majority, get mediocre results from their first surgery.
</p>
<p>
For me, I had my surgery nine months ago. I&#39;m still swelled, my left and right labia are uneven, although my clit isn&#39;t healed over completely, it is mostly covered except for a small key hole. Also my urethra isn&#39;t centered; its off to one side so I always spray when I pee. But all in all, I&#39;m happy every day that I got my surgery. Its not so bad for me. ymmv
