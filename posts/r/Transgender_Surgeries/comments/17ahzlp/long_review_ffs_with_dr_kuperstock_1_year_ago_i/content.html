Not to be unempathetic, but it‚Äôs kind of hard to support your claim with no pics. Especially when there are a lot of positive claims about the surgeon here.

For the sake of my privacy I don&#39;t post my face or personal details on socials and use multiple alts. I&#39;m not sure how I could share before and after&#39;s without showing. . . . . My face. Personally, I think seeing the surgeon&#39;s results compared to other&#39;s on this subreddit speaks for itself. even among Kuperstock&#39;s poor and underwhelming results, mine are especially non-transformative. I have some of the worst results I&#39;ve seen from him.
<br>
Edit: I added pictures of the main places I take issue with the surgery.

I added pictures. Pardon me, I didn&#39;t know the word of these men weighed more than the customers they performed these permanent procedures on.
</p>
<p>
I was being gracious in what I had to say. If my goal was to &#34;talk shit&#34; I could have easily been a lot more flowery and still made a perfectly genuine, while incendiary, attempt to slander this surgeon. Instead I say &#34;I earnestly caution you to pick someone better.&#34; I think that&#39;s very fair.

It&#39;s not that. This is an inherently visual discussion so photos are worth far more than the text-based medium when it comes to discussing morphology.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s so much dysmorphia here, in this community, that it&#39;s difficult to take anyone at their word alone - for good or bad.

I kinda agree, because he‚Äôs one of my surgeons to have a consult with and I‚Äôve seen nothing but good things. But not to sound like a b**ch but in want to see photos to back up these claims a bunch of words aren‚Äôt giving me ideas on how your face looks. Idk if your older or younger and personally to me I feel like the older you are the more surgery won‚Äôt really help with how delicate the face and bones become ‚Äúif that makes sense‚Äù ü§î

Kinda, in the case of aged faces it&#39;s more of a soft tissue problem tbh. People need bone work AND lifts, microfat transfers etc...
</p>
<p>
As people get older, irrespective of being male or female, the face tends to look more masculine with fascia descent and fat atrophy.

FFS works really well on older patients. In some cases I would say the results are more dramatic because it is undoing more of T‚Äôs effects. The other poster is correct soft tissue changes are increasingly relevant the older you get.

It&#39;s really common for post FFS dysphoric ladies to come on here. Bash a well respected surgeon, and not post pictures or evidence. Much of the time the surgeon did a great job or at least nothing wrong but the person has such crippling dysphoria they came here to vent anyway.
</p>
<p>
From reading your story and looking at your (very limited) pictures tho I&#39;m more inclined to believe you than to not.

I&#39;m really sorry to hear that you had such an abysmal experience. Can you get your money back and go somewhere else? I&#39;ll bet that another girl on here has been dissatisfied with her results and had a revision with another doctor, too.

This is all an opinion and there are many who feel quite the opposite.    I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt like your results.
</p>
<p>
I was 49 when I had surgery with Kupe.  It‚Äôs been two years.  It‚Äôs amazing when I tell people I‚Äôve had facial surgery.  They have no idea.    The comments are always the same.  Subtle and natural.   That‚Äôs how it should be.
</p>
<p>
If you wanna call me a Kupe fangirl that‚Äôs more than fine.   He deserves all the credit and then some.
<br>
His demeanor.  His work.  His follow up and attention to detail are all excellent.  He worked hard with with my insurance advocate to get things resolved.
</p>
<p>
I hear the Butcher of Ardmore  does FFS.  Maybe you should go to her.  You‚Äôll really have something to complain about.
</p>
<p>
I saw your photos.  Based on your angles, the argument you post doesn‚Äôt hold up.   I think you just wanted to be dramatic.
</p>
<p>
No surgeon is perfect but to slander him and call him an inexperienced surgeon is garbage.

Based on your pictures I think your brow could have been reduced more. I personally think surgeons who do pre-op planing with CTs and  make cutting guides get the most agressive (best?) results here. I say this for others researching surgeons/procedures.
</p>
<p>
Your forehead result is within the feminine range though.
</p>
<p>
Nose seems fine. Its not masculine in any way but noses are probably the hardest thing in plastic surgery because of how complex they are and how subjective they are. Rhinoplasty is one of the most common revisions. Go to someone who specializes in rhino/revisions.
</p>
<p>
Jaw/chin is again in the feminine range. It might not be what you were hoping for but it isn‚Äôt stopping you from passing.
</p>
<p>
I would say the number one thing from the pics you shared is the hairline/temples. I have seen better advances. There are some techniques which help close up the temple better. Fortunately, you can resolve this hair grafts. Honestly, I think that will really improve your passing.
