Hey lovely people!!
</p>
<p>
I thought I&#39;d just come in here, add to the literature that has helped me so much in understanding AND eventually book my vaginoplasty for January 2021!
</p>
<p>
The following is my notes from two recent consultations with Dr. Kieran Hart, a urologist practicing at the National Capital Private Hospital in Canberra, Australia.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On Dr. Hart&#39;s methods:-
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Gave me the option of Penile Inversion Vaginoplasty, Peritoneal Pull Through Vaginoplasty or no-depth labiaplasty.
</li>
<li>
Performing his first peritoneal pull through procedures later this year, with some very keen ladies.
</li>
<li>
Advised against Peritoneal Pull Through, because of constant lubrication and increased risk of complications.
</li>
<li>
Said I could, say a few years down the line, opt for PPT if I was unhappy or decided I wanted better lubrication. So the option is there after the fact
</li>
<li>
Uses a tunical graft (internal lining of the scrotum, part of the peritoneum) in penile inversion to line the far end of the vaginal canal. This may result in some form of lubrication.
</li>
<li>
Dr. Hart doesn’t require hair removal due to the use of the tunical graft - as he only uses the hairless skin from the shaft + the hairless graft
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
On recovery post surgery:-
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Approximately 1 week for PIV &amp; 1 week 3 days for PPV
</li>
<li>
SALT BATHS are ESSENTIAL for healing as well as expediting the fading away of scarring.
</li>
<li>
DILATION:- (First 6 weeks:- 3 times daily at 45 mins each) (After that 2 times daily at 45 mins for first year)
</li>
<li>
Catheter is in for 7 days, after that packing is taken out and you are discharged the next day
</li>
<li>
It is preferable that you stay in Canberra a week following the surgery, however this is not essential.
</li>
<li>
Followup via phone at 6 weeks post-op
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the overall results &amp; aesthetics:-
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Aesthetics were overall good, pictures post-op all look like vaginas! My mother is a nurse and she gave me the thumbs about this also!!
</li>
<li>
Kieran stated that the greatest aesthetic result appears to be on slimmer girls, resulting in a more prominent labia minora
</li>
<li>
Vaginal canal length was quoted at 5-7 inches (8-17cm) for uncircumcised
</li>
<li>
I think Kieran would appreciate me stating a second time that salt baths are the biggest factor in how well scars fade over time. DO SALT BATHS
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
On Dr. Hart’s history:-
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Kieran Hart is a urologist who studied Gender Reassignment Surgery at the NHS charing cross hospital in London, under Dr. Phil Thomas (who was performed 5000~ grs)
</li>
<li>
Dr Hart stated that he had approximately 50 surgeries under his belt at Charing Cross and around another 50 at his practice in Canberra.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-hart-96b4b5111/?originalSubdomain=uk">Here is Dr. Hart’s linkedin
</a>
also if you wanted to take a look at his education history
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, I am very excited about the opportunity to finally be completely comfortable with my body. 2021 is looking like a very fun year.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, please don&#39;t hesitate in asking.

This seems very much like it depends upon the person.  At least for me while there was no hair at the top and lots of hair at the base it was a gradient with a few hairs higher than I would have ever guessed initially.  If you go this route I would ask how many cm he looks to use and make sure that is clear.

Yeah I was worried also. He said that he has never had an incidence of hair inside the vaginal canal, so I&#39;m not too worried

Unsure. The reason they advise against having oral oestradiol a month out is because of blood clots.
</p>
<p>
Ask your GP/Dr. Hart&#39;s offices about it.

I don’t know about Hart, but surgeons normally allow it and I’ve never heard of anyone taking one out for surgery. You usually get new ones more frequently to keep levels up, but they last a couple of years  otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Best check of course.

Do you mind me asking the cost? And we’re you required to have private health? And what were his waiting times like? :)

I&#39;ve been quoted about $26,000 out of pocket, with about $13,000 back on medicare + HCF private health insurance
</p>
<p>
I got in contact with Dr. Hart&#39;s ofice in August, had a consultation booked for september, and was given a surgery date for January immediately.

Which package of private health do you have?
</p>
<p>
I’m also with HCF I just want to know if I’m on the right tier for surgery.

Top hospital cover. We just upgraded to Corp Gold $500, just in case. Id get in touch with Hart&#39;s receptionists and ask exactly what you&#39;ll need though

How much of that was Medicare vs HCF?

Like how much would you get back with just Medicare.

Congratulations! Hes gorgeous right? True blue Aussie and really put my ease at every moment
</p>
<p>
Only issue I found was that he wasnt super on top of post-op care. Barely showed up to my room &amp; isnt super detailed about what to do after you get discharged
</p>
<p>
But in a way, I guess his confidence in the lack of information is also a plus? I dunno

Have read, did you read his reply? It was also posted in the Trans Surgery group.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think the complaints are as serious as made out to be, a lot of it is to do with the hospital.

The end result sounded very much like a complication as opposed to surgeon error. Things can go wrong. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to blame the surgeon for what sounds like an issue in healing that&#39;s likely still fixable.

It’s not a question of fairness. If you have surgery the only person you should be thinking of is yourself. There are quite a number of bad surgeons around, so automatically giving any surgeon the benefit of the doubt is risky.
</p>
<p>
The difficulty right now is that there’s very few reviews of his work, partly because he’s done so few of these surgeries.
</p>
<p>
People have different views on all this. Some don’t think about it at all. I can’t really relate to that, I trust no one. One thing for sure is that he will have plenty more patients and we will know better in time.

One question, did you have to go through the gatekeeper process of psychology approval before surgery?

Yes, two psychologist letters. Not psychiatrist thankfully.
</p>
<p>
One from my current psychologist, which was piss easy and didn&#39;t require any additional fees.
</p>
<p>
One from a very dehumanising clinic where they after charging me for the appointment, gave me a form to fill out with great questions like (On a scale of 1-10, how much do you not like being a man). Honeslty, fucking hate them. And they charged me an extra few hundred dollars for the pleasure of the letter.
