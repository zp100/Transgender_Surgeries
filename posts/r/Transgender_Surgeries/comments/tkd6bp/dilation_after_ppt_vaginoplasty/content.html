Try aiming in different directions. Like pushing inwards more towards the belly or towards the back. Maybe that&#39;s where the rest of the depth is hidden.

4.3 inches is enough for some penis, it would not have been for preop me. Average I remember to be around 6 inches length. Penis does not necessarily need to go in 100% so if you have a partner who cares about you it is enough to have intimacy when the penetrating partner is more careful. In the end you need to decide if the way it is enough for you or you need a revision at some point.

Keep trying with dilation and add mild pressure when it bottoms out, not enough to tear anything just stretch it a tiny bit.  See vaginal agenesis and old Frank method of dilation.  Probably best when healed further.

It was created for agenesis of the vagina and also with a short vaginal dimple.  It involves a mounted dilator and using progressive pressure and time to deepen and widen the canal.  I am sure it is very painful.  It is also a very oldtechnique. Try google for details
