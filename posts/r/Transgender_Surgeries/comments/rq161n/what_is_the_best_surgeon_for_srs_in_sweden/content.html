Source is me/primary.

If you are already at ANOVA I believe you can request meeting with Gunnar Kratz (Linköping) to ask questions and see photos. I did this as soon as I had my diagnosis at ANOVA, and had a chance to meet him and see photos of results etc. I
<em>
think
</em>
for Swedish medical legal reasons the photos couldn&#39;t be published anywhere (
<em>
somebody please correct me if I&#39;m wrong
</em>
), but they did look good at least. Like Sophie pointed out, it&#39;s a two-part surgery; you have the big one and then 3-4 months later you plan when the revision + breast augmentation (if you want it) will be. (according to the packet they gave me)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;ve got mine mine in a few months with him. I&#39;m personally not too comfortable sharing photos of myself, but I hope to report at least how it goes in some text form.
</p>
<p>
I know you asked for names/types, the only other thing I&#39;d caution on is waiting times. Not sure how it goes for private, but if you go the diagnosis/waiting-list route know the process has been four years for me (two for diagnosis, two waiting) and that is considered fast nowadays. If you have the money for it, abroad might be faster.

The wait for the surgery has gotten worse because of the pandemic. I was told about 8 months before the shit hit the fan. Then I was told January of this year before they had to close again, finally went in in October.
</p>
<p>
Re: breast augmentation, they used to not do it as the same time as the second stage, but they suggest it now because the pandemic has made it harder to book anesthetists.
</p>
<p>
And yes, you can request going with Gunnar even if doing the diagnosis in ANOVA, that&#39;s how I did it. If you don&#39;t ask for it they will refer to the team at Karolinska instead.

Thanks for elaborating!
</p>
<p>
I think they gave me a rough estimate a year out for Dec 2021 originally, and now 3 months before I got the &#39;official&#39; phone call for my week in early March 2022. Also expecting push-out due to the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Interesting overlap with the BA -- I was suggested to do it the same time as the revision, and that was before the pandemic...But I never dug into the reasons for why; I just assumed it was &#39;convenient&#39; or something. But whatever the reasons are now is what would matter though, so thanks for the update! Wouldn&#39;t have expected anesthetist scheduling to be the issue.
</p>
<p>
Didn&#39;t know they were just defaulting folks to Karolinska nowadays. The System here seems to favor sticking up for yourself a bit more e.g. having to be very explicit what you want to do?
</p>
<p>
I only got to ANOVA and then to Gunnar by being pushy about it and asking for referrals. Southern Sweden&#39;s wait times were horrendous (2 years after I started the process I finally got a letter from them for my first psych appointment to start the eval, and ofc I already had my diagnosis from ANOVA by then and was in the process of changing my gender marker)
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Oh! Not related, but for others running across this...despite me *thinking* I had mentioned wanting FFS (and it being them who told me Spain was good) my journals in fact have only one vague note about it. To anyone else running across this...be explicit, and mention things you want
<em>
repeatedly across several appointments
</em>
so it is documented in your journals (afik it&#39;s crucial to have it documented there for compensation for FFS later). My bottom dysphoria was clearly documented because I was persistent about it (and tbh, it bothered me LOTS more at the time), but not FFS because I was &#39;meh&#39; about it at the time and didn&#39;t bring it up as much as I should have. (bothers me more now than it did then)
</p>
<p>
You can always view your journals digitally at
<a href="https://journalen.1177.se/" rel="nofollow">https://journalen.1177.se/
</a>
but request a paper copy before you get your new personnummer if possible (otherwise they can give you one after) because you&#39;ll lose access after the change.

They always will by default send referrals to the same province, or one close if it&#39;s something they don&#39;t have there. You can always ask for referrals somewhere else. At least in ANOVA they didn&#39;t give me any trouble with it.
</p>
<p>
Did they tell you funding for FFS was a possibility? It certainly wasn&#39;t a thing when I last was at ANOVA.

Nope. They said nothing, didn&#39;t know it was a possibility until I watched a webinar about it (asking them for a link so I can post it here)

Gunnar is the one that has been doing it the longest, teaches other surgeons and is flown to Finland to do surgeries there.
<del>
I read that he learned in Chonburi, and I forgot to confirm with him if it was with Suporn.
</del>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve only heard good things about him from transmasculine and transfeminine people who had different surgeries done by him, which is why I chose him. I can&#39;t speak of my results yet because he does two stage vaginoplasty and I&#39;m going for the second stage in two weeks. The sub&#39;s wiki has links to someone&#39;s experience with him for vaginoplasty, the recovery journal this person keps seems to have been deleted, but the photos are still there.

I should add that the first stage went very well and the way I was treated by him, the other surgeons, and the nurses (minus a couple of minor issues) was great.

There’s no way he learned in Chonburi. There’s only Suporn there and he’s never taught foreign surgeons. There are a number of other Thai surgeons that do have foreign surgeons do training with them.

You might be right. I read that some time ago on a website I can&#39;t find again (it didn&#39;t belong to the hospital where he works). I just looked up his resume and there&#39;s no mention of it. The rest of the comment still stands, though.

Aren&#39;t Karolinska/Stockholm and Linköping done by different surgeons? I&#39;m at least pretty-sure Gunnar doesn&#39;t do vaginoplasty at Karolinska?

Yes, it&#39;s different surgeons. Gunnar, in Sweden, operates only in Linköping. He also does Finland as I mentioned in my comment, and as I found out a few minutes ago, Iceland.

I am trying everyday to accept myself as i am. Go through a lot of new emotions, new puberty, risk to not pass. Surgery in genetalia that are full of risks and can go really wrong. Ofc all surgeries can go wrong, but in this case its about genitals. We make a lot of sacrifices to just be happy, or try to. And what if we dont get any happier? Loss of people you like in your life. Problem on workplaces.
</p>
<p>
People who don&#39;t know what we going through can&#39;t put them self in to these situations. If i say i have accepted myself, i am lying. If we transition fully with or without surgery, its not a garantee people use right prones. Problem to find partners. Especially guys.
</p>
<p>
I went to a place in sweden called &#34;uppsala&#34; and they said they have a waiting time around 2 years, so they recommended me to go to anova, they only had 1 year. So i choosed anova. First it was 1 year, then i got a paper that i need to wait 18 months more. And now when that waiting time was over, i got a new paper that said i need to wait one more year. I have thought about DIY, but buying hormones and use them yourself are both expensive and risky. And in my case i don&#39;t have that money since i am unemployed. 🙂
</p>
<p>
So one thing is for sure. Beeing trans are neather bad or shit, and nothing in between. It sucks so bad!. However, thanks for me, and i hope i can survive. I cant garantee. Cause i am seriously tierd of this bullshit to be honest.
</p>
<p>
Take care guys.

Whats interesting is that the trans care in sweden is paid by the state because the risk of suicide are high, therefor its &#34;free&#34; as they say. Free healthcare. But does the suicidr rate really drop with these waiting? I am a pretty strong person, commit suicide are not an option for me really, but the constant anxeity and other mental health problems are starting to get very serious. Like many others. 👎

The wait times in Sweden are abysmally long. Despite already have been on hormones for a long timr with internationally accredited doctors and therapists giving strong recommendations they fought me every step of the way from being able to picj up my medicine in Sweden. I was told I had to wait in the back of the line like everyone else just to start HRT ajd the doctors said I&#39;d have to stop my current hormone doseage totally for months before the blood test or they&#39;d have to make me wait again. I had recommendations from doctors in Sweden and US, and therapists in Sweden and US. So that was just to aee if I&#39;m trans enough to continue my HRT. Was told that the wait would be years. I tried killing myself twice in one night a week or two after the doctirs threatened to hang up on me because I was crying because of not being able to continue my hormones for a looooong time.
