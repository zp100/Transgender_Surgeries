I have something similar.  Its mostly not in the way though and doesn&#39;t bother me when I dilate so I may or may not have it fixed.  If I go for a revision for anything else I&#39;ll have them do it at the same time, but until it causes a problem for me I&#39;m just leaving it

I’ve seen a much smaller version of that before that was just scar tissue and removed in a revision. I’m sure it’s fairly trivial to get rid of it, especially compared to SRS itself.

I don’t quite understand how it formed though? Wouldn’t dilation stop it from ever happening?

Not sure. I dilate fine and use the green and orange dilators without an issue. Now that I’m at 4.5 months I only do it two times a day and that seems to be going ok.
