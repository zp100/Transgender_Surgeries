I have a wound from FFS that&#39;s in my hair that I&#39;ve been told has developed granulation tissue. It has a pretty thick scab and under the scab is a raised bump of tissue. It was treated once with silver nitrate but it hasn&#39;t gotten much better.
</p>
<p>
Is this likely to be an ongoing issue? How hard is it to get rid of this stuff? I just want to move on from this surgery but I feel like dealing with this complication is holding me up.

Thanks for sharing! I actually did and he&#39;s absolutely willing to treat it for free except that he&#39;s 1200 miles away in another state. Flying is pretty much out of the question now between work, the holidays and covid. I&#39;ve been getting it treated locally but I&#39;d much rather have a plastic surgeon doing it.

<p>
Did yours scab up a lot? Right now it has a pretty thick scab and underneath is a raised bubble of pinkish flesh that&#39;s still a bit bloody.

Yeah that sounds a lot like my scab! The scab is a lot thicker and crustier than the original wound.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon is in another state and it&#39;s not easy to get back there for in-office treatments, especially with the pandemic. I&#39;ve been going to a wound clinic at a nearby hospital where they treated it with silver nitrate and sent me on my way telling me to leave it alone. Now my surgeon is saying it would be best to have a plastic surgeon excise the tissue but I don&#39;t know where to go.

So today they confirmed it was hypergranulation tissue. I&#39;m concerned because it&#39;s an area a little bigger than my thumbnail. Did hair grow back throw yours or am I going to have a bald spot there?

Its pretty common with GRS. May just need a couple more silver nitrate treatments. Your gp should be able to handle it

Thanks. I&#39;ve been going to a wound clinic. But I had FFS revisions and never heard of someone getting it from that.

I haven’t either. I’d try searching the medical literature.
</p>
<p>
Maybe there’s something here

Hypergranulation can happen with any surgical incision. It seems rare with FFS, but it&#39;s certainly not unheard of. It may need additional silver nitrate treatments, but you might also try hydrocortisone cream, which is another common treatment used for it.
