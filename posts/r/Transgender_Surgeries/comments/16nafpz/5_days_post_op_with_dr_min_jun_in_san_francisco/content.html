Last Thursday I received PPT vaginoplasty from Dr. Min Jun in San Francisco California. I know that there has been some controversy surrounding him in this subreddit; let me be clear that in sharing my experience I am doing just that, and by no means do I intend to contradict the accounts of others. That being said, I had a very favorable experience with Dr. Jun. He is experienced and knowledgeable and knows how to make sure you do everything you need to do. His bedside manner was pretty good; he made me feel calm, made me laugh, and overall took solid care of me.
</p>
<p>
I will say he kind of did just make my vagina and fuck off lmao. I did not see him at the hospital except I think when I woke up (I do not remember this well, though). In fairness, it was the weekend and I was in the extremely good care of the nursing staff at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital so his presence was not strictly needed. I did see him again today for my first follow up and everything went well. The catheter, sewn-in dressing, and vaginal packing were all removed. I started dilating which is not strictly painful but is somewhat uncomfortable, though I can achieve maximum depth with the blue dilator without much issue. Overall I am very happy, though there remains quite a bit of bruising and swelling that I am eager to say goodbye to!
</p>
<p>
One more note: I also met Dr. Kenan Celtik today. He seemed like a nice guy and was also knowledgeable and seemed ready to take over the practice. As you all know, Dr. Jun is leaving the Crane Center. I don‚Äôt know the circumstances of his departure but I will say that it‚Äôs probably a good call; I would describe the Crane Center as‚Ä¶ sub par when it comes to patient relations. There just isn‚Äôt much, I guess, urgency(?) from them? I didn‚Äôt have the best experience. That being said, Dr. Celtik seems like a good doctor and I appreciated meeting him.

I always think his results are the best I‚Äôve seen he‚Äôs the only doctor I‚Äôve ever considered? What is the controversy about him? I need to be enlightened on that. I thought he was really good

I can vouch for him as well. I was super concerned about this one girl‚Äôs experience. Like OP i don‚Äôt want to discredit anyone‚Äôs opinion or version of how they were treated by Min Jun, but to me he was absolutely wonderful. I have many doctors in my family, very good ones if I may say, and Dr. Jun behaves like one. He is professional, is really passionate and very warm. Unlike most FFS surgeons lol who think they are some kind of gods, this guy is humble and grounded and loves what he does. I am beyond happy and grateful for him‚Ä¶

A poster here had a bad experience with him. It‚Äôs not consistent with my experience, but I am one person.

Wow!  Only 5 days and your vag already looks that good?  I know Dr. Jun does good work, but this is just amazing.  So happy for you.
</p>
<p>
If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to ask a couple of questions.
</p>
<p>
First, can you tell me what insurance you have and what your experience was with them?
</p>
<p>
Second, I was not aware Dr. Jun is leaving Crane.  Do you know where he is going?  He&#39;s on my short list of surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

Thank you! I am very happy with it. I think it will look fantastic when it‚Äôs healed.
</p>
<p>
For insurance I have Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. When I finished my consultation, I was given a verification of benefits which detailed that my insurance covered the procedures I was to receive (vaginoplasty is treated by insurance as a set of many procedures). This was preliminary confirmation, not official, and was in line with my expectations I established in my own communication with my insurance (for instance, having the crane center send me all of the procedure codes I would need and calling my insurance to have them run them by hand to check for coverage). Then 90 days before my surgery, I received official confirmation of coverage in the mail.
</p>
<p>
As for Dr. Jun, I do not know where he is going. He will probably open his own practice, which won‚Äôt emerge I would assume for some months. He has said he will remain in San Francisco.

I‚Äôm 9 days post op with him, and I had a very similar experience to you. I‚Äôm happy with my results and healing so far, but you are right, the Crane Center is pretty subpar when it comes to patient relations.
</p>
<p>
I got my packing and catheter out yesterday, and it has made such a difference! Plus, being able to shower again is really nice too!

I had a question about your insurance I do too live in Texas and I‚Äôm looking into insurances so I can get my bottom surgery. Did you have to pay anything out pocket even tho insurance covered the surgery. Did you have to pay an out of pocket maximum or deductible to get your surgery?

Wow that looks great for 5 days post. How has the pain been? Were you able to ease out of anesthesia quite easily? I think thats the most scary part for me xD

Pain has been fine. Bad at times, but for the most part totally manageable with the meds given. The discomfort from the bloating as a result of the laparoscopic portion of the procedure‚Ä¶ that is quite terrible. Not pain per se but was pretty bad. It‚Äôs passed now.
</p>
<p>
As far as waking up from anesthesia, I was pretty zonked for a long time. I slept most of the first day only coming to for a moment or so. I talked some to my family but otherwise just slept. In the days after I would gradually have more energy. But it wasn‚Äôt bad at all. Just let yourself be zonked and it passes.

If you don&#39;t mind my asking, do you know if Dr Jun will be performing PPT Vaginoplasty at his new practice? it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t know, I just know he&#39;s leaving the crane center but I want to book a consult with him!

He didn‚Äôt say, but I can‚Äôt imagine why he wouldn‚Äôt. He seems pretty attached to the surgery and he‚Äôs spent a lot of time developing his technique. I would say there‚Äôs no indication he will stop providing PPT.
