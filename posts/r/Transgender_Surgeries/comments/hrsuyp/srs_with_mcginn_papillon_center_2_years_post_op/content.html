<li>
Who was the surgeon?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
McGinn in July of 2018
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Why did you choose them?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Results seemed adequate, and there were good reviews. I was able to see them without waiting multiple years.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Would you recommend them to others?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the most part yes. Dr McGinn was courteous but a bit defensive when I asked questions about the results. Her support staff seemed to give me conflicting information (ie I was told I had no labia by one).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
What did it cost?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Roughly $14,000, which I paid up front but was covered by insurance
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How long was the waitlist?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
6 months
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How was the pain?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not awful, but there were some stitches to hold my legs together that would pull just through normal movement that hurt a lot.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Any complications?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Visible in my photos, there is a hole on my right labia that was left by a stitch. An attempt was made shortly after (a month later) to resolve this, but there was extensive webbing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How does it look?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Look is acceptable. There are a few things I am considering getting a second stage for such as refinement of clitoral hood, labia majora doesn&#39;t surround fully, vaginal opening being located below the fourchette.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How does it feel?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have reduced feeling in my labia minora. It&#39;s come back slowly but is still not particularly sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Internally I have good feeling. Sex feels good but I have only managed to orgasm using my clitoris. This isn&#39;t much different from my ability to orgasm prior to surgery though.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For SRS, what was your depth?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Depth was around 5.5 inches after surgery and has remained there with some stretching.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Other points of note
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was on the upper end of the weight she allowed for surgery.

Wow, your results and mine are very similar in
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/R1Ttvy6.jpg">appearance
</a>
(NSFW), at least externally. I had mine done with McGinn in August 2018.

Thank you for sharing this. I am approaching my third anniversary with Dr. Chettawut, so this post has helped inform how I might structure that anniversary post.

I looked through the &#34;Making Useful Surgery Posts&#34; section of the
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index" rel="nofollow">Wiki (toward the bottom)
</a>
for a list of common questions and answered those. Adding in a section for feeling.

Thank you - McGinn isn&#39;t my top choice, but I did submit an intake package to her office yesterday.

How was the process of getting reimbursed from your insurance like? How long did it took etc?!

It wasn&#39;t difficult. I got pre-approved and after had to forward the bill to my insurance and they reimbursed me without much issue. Different insurance companies may be different though.
