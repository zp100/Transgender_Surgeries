So, I&#39;m about 2.5 months post with McGinn... I know, I know. That&#39;s not super far into recovery. At my six week follow-up though, I was told I could start experimenting with masturbation right away. This is earlier than I thought it would be, but I was feeling pretty pain free already at that point and decided to try it out.
</p>
<p>
First attempt, took me almost an hour of progressively more intense clitoral stimulation, but I managed a weak ass orgasm at the end of it. I figured since I worked so hard, I should take a couple days off from messing with it.
</p>
<p>
Second attempt, three days later. Another hour of progressively more intense rubbing, felt it coming in and held back for as long as I could, released a substantially more intense orgasm
</p>
<p>
I wasn&#39;t especially aroused either time because my hormones were still really low, but I figured I succeeded, so need to experiment anymore until I got my blood work sorted out. Fast forward a few weeks, I&#39;m bored, I try again. About 45 minutes with no results. It felt good, sure, but I wasn&#39;t able to get anything otherwise, and towards the end I was kind of just getting numb anyway so I gave up. I tried again a week later, same shit.
</p>
<p>
Now here I am one more week removed, and with my hormones increased, still the same story. I tried like three different toys, messed around with some beginner level insertion (I have a plastic vibrator that&#39;s about as wide as a crayola markers). It was easy to get it in and wiggle it around, but I still got nothing.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say... Pretty frustrating. I still don&#39;t really have much of a libido, so that maybe has something to do with it, but I was able to get there on my first two attempts with my head barely in it at all. My big question I guess is how will I know if I&#39;m hitting my prostate?? I experimented with anal stuff a little bit pre op, and it felt good but I could really pinpoint HOW it felt good. I didn&#39;t think of it at the time. Should it feel similar to that though? Right now, I get virtually nothing out of penetrative stuff, even tilting the vibrator &#34;up&#34; towards where my g-spot should be.
</p>
<p>
Any advice? Or do I just need to give it some more time?

I wasn&#39;t able to orgasm until 18 months post op. I&#39;ve also found I have to be &#39;in the mood&#39; I can&#39;t manually have an orgasm anymore, if I&#39;m not already aroused then no dice.

Thanks for sharing that. Like the OP, I&#39;m about 2+ months post op, and tried some light experimentation a couple times - I managed to get a little bit elated, but no orgasm. I got sore, but no joy. :/
<br>
After about an hour I just got bored and gave up. Doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m almost never in the mood.

Honestly, as an ftm trans person, it sounds like normal female sexualization to me :o pre t it took me around 1 hr to orgasm and it was always super weak. Just sounds like you&#39;ll have to figure out what works best for you and take your time doing that. Happy healing :)

That is reassuring, for sure. It&#39;s weird having to actually take my time with it. Whole different ballgame.

I wouldn&#39;t worry. It takes time to re-learn your body. It took me almost two years to figure out how to masturbate post-op.  It&#39;s much more of a mental thing.  I really have to be in the mood. Just shoving something in there won&#39;t do it. I finally found a combination of penetration and clitoral play that worked.  Still, my orgasms are much more diffuse and less intense.  It&#39;s like a small wave of feeling that leaves me panting. I think it&#39;s different for everyone, though. I have a friend who tells me her orgasms are intense. (We both went to McGinn, btw).

My second orgasm was pretty similar to what it felt like pre op, but still definitely more diffuse, like you said. Penetration is doing exactly nothing for me so far, so I&#39;m hoping that develops some more over time.

So far, yes.  Nothing like the intensity of ejaculation.  I think it&#39;s really a YMMV thing.  Dr. McGinn told me that whatever your &#34;normal&#34; was before surgery was likely to carry over after surgery.  If you normally had a lot of pre-ejaculate before, you will probably have more wetness after surgery. If you had strong orgasms before, you were more likely to have them afterwards.

I largely agree with what Maybebaby57 is saying, but I think for a different reason. I actually think my orgasm (during my second attempt) was just as intense as my best ones pre op, but it&#39;s more &#34;diffuse&#34; now, which makes sense when you think about it. It used to be that a bunch of the pleasant sensation was localized to a single appendage... Now that appendage has been reconfigured and is more &#34;spread out&#34;.
</p>
<p>
That being said, that was with purely clitoral stimulation. Prostate stimulation always resulted in the &#34;string orgasms&#34; described prior to surgery. So I&#39;m hoping I&#39;ll get there with penetrative stuff eventually. Like, I feel like I just mess with my clit when I want to get off and that&#39;s all. I&#39;d mess with my g-spot for a more intense and involved session of &#34;me time&#34; or sex with my partner.

I had McGinn about a year ago. It slowly came back for me and is now substantially easier for me to get off, especially with somebody else. Give it time and get some good toys. The fact that you have an orgasm back this quickly is a good sign.

Yeah, I was surprised and even kind of nervous when I felt it coming on that first time. I was REALLY concerned about hurting myself. I&#39;m super pleased with McGinn&#39;s work though.

Did you have an orchiectomy before SRS or were they removed at the same time?
</p>
<p>
If it was at the same time I would say give it a little more time, your body needs a while to recover just from the hormonal shift alone caused by removing gonads.
</p>
<p>
Either way though just give a little more time and don’t give up hope. I’ve gone through so many periods of loss of libido and gaining it back during my transition due to hormonal changes and even just subtle tweaks in medication.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not on progesterone that’s always something to try. Can be pretty effective at returning libido.
</p>
<p>
Also don’t forget that libido can be worked on. Strengthening pelvic floor, stretching the pelvic floor, meditation and mindfulness. Even just exercises like walking can help a ton.

I hadn&#39;t had an orchi, and I figured my hormones would be setting me back for awhile. I think I have a combination of barriers going on at the moment, and hopefully getting my hormones totally worked out will resolve some of that.
</p>
<p>
I actually asked McGinn&#39;s PA about progesterone and she said a low dose of testosterone would be a better option because it could help rebuild some of my muscle mass. I really don&#39;t like the idea of taking T though, so I might get a second opinion.

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery so far? What made you choose Dr. McGinn over other doctors? Do you recommend Dr. McGinn? And how do you consider your results in terms of cosmetics? How is your vaginal depth? How was the stay in New Hope? How was Dr. McGinn aftercare? and by the way many congratulations for the surgery

Not sure why you got downvoted because I found this to be a helpful reply for real. This last time I messed around was the first time post op that I enjoyed my vibrator again, and it was right at the opening of my vulva and around my clitoris (instead of directly on it) that felt best, just as you described. I did start by just rubbing it directly though and could see how I just number myself too quickly as a consequence. My wife is cis and she has told me that the same thing happens to her if she just goes at it too quickly like that.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll try to be a little more creative next time.

As someone else said already you have to be &#34;in the mood&#34; for it to be really enjoyable. It doesn&#39;t work by just physically forcing things.
</p>
<p>
Ok maybe it does but it&#39;s gonna take forever and will be weak.
</p>
<p>
It makes a difference between 1-2h with nothing vs multiple in short intervals.
