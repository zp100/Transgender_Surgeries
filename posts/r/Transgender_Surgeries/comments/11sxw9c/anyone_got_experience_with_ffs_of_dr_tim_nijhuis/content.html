After 3 years on hormones I&#39;m evaluating if FFS could help me lower my dysphoria. In The Netherlands there are a few options for FFS. One of them is Dr. Tim Nijhuis in Nijmegen. I can&#39;t find a lot about his FFS online. Does anyone have any experiences with him (or another FFS in The Netherlands)?
</p>
<p>
I probably want to do something with my brow bone, but I&#39;m kinda scared for this operation. I want it to look more feminine but also very natural.

There really isn&#39;t a lot of information about him at all... I found
<a href="https://t-nederland.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?p=186500#p186500" rel="nofollow">this comment
</a>
about his FFS work in a thread about SRS. OP has said some more things about him elsewhere I think so maybe look through her profile.
</p>
<p>
I think the best way to get info on him is try to schedule something with him. Talk to him about it, ask for some result pictures. That&#39;s what I did, I have talked to him three times now about SRS and he got me convinced.
</p>
<p>
He sounds like he knows what he&#39;s doing. He comes over professionally and is more than happy to answer questions you have. Besides, his results look good (though I don&#39;t know about FFS). Now it&#39;s just waiting on hair removal and the waiting list. (The waiting list is only 3-4 months according to what he said to me last week so that&#39;s reasonable)
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that in the Netherlands it&#39;s really difficult to get FFS covered, it&#39;s only covered if you don&#39;t pass without it. Expect to pay for it yourself and only potentially see some reimbursement after a lawsuit against your insurance provider.

Bit of an old message but I feel like it&#39;s still worthwhile to reply
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not passing but I put in a dispute with assistance from Transvisie and I got it covered! IZA is my insurance.
</p>
<p>
It is planned Q2 with Tim Nijhuis but I don&#39;t have a concise surgery date yet. ‚ù§Ô∏èüïä Will write how it goes.

</p>

Thanks a lot for your comment! I&#39;m planning to schedule a consult with Dr. Tim Nijhuis as soon as I get the opportunity. As I also want to do SRS at some point, I&#39;m thinking of combining the consult for both FFS and SRS, to get a good impression for both. I&#39;m already putting my questions on paper.
</p>
<p>
How come you talked with him about SRS three times before being convinced? Were you talking with other doctors too? What kind of questions did you ask him about the operation to become convinced?

Well the three times was because I messed up. The first time I didn&#39;t do my research properly and I thought he only did orchidectomies and not SRS. I wasn&#39;t properly prepared so I scheduled another one but it was over the phone. I wanted to see some pictures but of course he&#39;s not going to mail other people&#39;s vaginas to random people. After those two where I asked a lot of questions, it mostly came down to just if I liked the results and I do so I am pushing through.

It somewhat improved. I won 50hz, and also I have a falsetto now with even higher pitches possible although it&#39;s very weak. Daily &#34;singing&#34; exercises kinda helped with that. Still improvement to make. The theory is that my muscles weakened during surgery and therefor the false vocal folds try to help at higher pitches. By doing singing exercises the muscles should become stronger over time. In a month I&#39;ll be going to my ENT doctor again to check for improvement (which I think there definetly is).
