Dr. Kathy Rumer DO is a surgeon in eastern PA who has made a lucrative living performing GCS surgeries, the majority of which are rushed and have shoddy outcomes which leave the patients with lifelong injuries. Kathy Rumer has left a trail of almost unspeakable atrocities in her wake from patients who lost sensation to patients who have had the wall between their vagina and their rectal area torn. Patients of Rumer often have to undergo stressful and costly revision surgeries with other doctors. Kathy also has a long standing reputation for ghosting and victim blaming her patients whenever complications arise. Every other week there is a new horror account on Reddit where someone comes out who was victimized by this doctor in her genocide against the trans community. While nobody has died at the hands of Rumer (as far as we know) She has left many of us mangled and broken.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, Rumer continues to dodge accountability for her actions, not only have a decade’s worth of complaints to medical boards, hospitals, and insurance companies
<a href="https://jezebel.com/when-surgeons-fail-their-trans-patients-1844774990?rev=1597854733082">fallen upon deaf ears
</a>
, Dr. Rumer has had a total of four medical malpractice lawsuits against her, all of them resulting in a settlement. Rumer’s legal matters don’t just end there, Dr. Kathy Rumer actually employed a
<a href="https://i.redd.it/0f3j1bwaiim91.png">Republican affiliated legal firm
</a>
(with former Trump ties) to silence two of her low income trans patients from speaking out, and if this was not egregious enough, her lawyers were transphobic (forced a patient to disclose her deadname during a deposition) and ultimately got this girl to cave to a gag order under the threat of this patient’s genitals being up for public scrutiny in front of a juried trial which would be presided over by
<a href="https://epgn.com/2020/12/15/judge-suspends-new-antibias-rule-for-pa-attorneys/">a Trump appointed anti-LGBTQ judge.
</a>
This level of cruelty against a marginalized community is unbefitting of someone who performatively pretends to advocate for us.
</p>
<p>
Rumer’s reckless endangerment of her patients does not stop there,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOppmz3vQbI&amp;t=366s">Her team has prescribed medications which could have possibly killed their patient.
</a>
Patients have also
<a href="https://i.redd.it/otno2jqj80la1.png">reported
</a>
being misgendered by her staff. Dr. Rumer has even expressed her own silent
<a href="https://i.redd.it/1fiv2hkx05l91.jpg">transphobia
</a>
by using a stock photo of an “androgynous male model” to advertise facial feminization surgery in addition to the
<a href="https://i.ibb.co/8z8tBmZ/Stockphotos.jpg">rest of the stock photos
</a>
she uses to mislead people to the outcomes of her surgical results. Dr. Rumer has even blatantly
<a href="https://i.redd.it/qwgk4qhc15l91.png">admitted in court
</a>
to her false advertising without consequence.
</p>
<p>
According to a
<a href="https://jezebel.com/when-surgeons-fail-their-trans-patients-1844774990?rev=1597854733082">Jezebel article
</a>
(which is predominantly about Rumer) It is next to impossible to hold doctors like Rumer accountable. So what can actually be done while our healthcare and legal system continuously fails to protect us from medical grifters like Dr. Rumer?
</p>
<p>
The answer: It is up to us to hold Rumer and all of the people who protect her accountable.
<strong>
We hold them accountable through organizing and direct action which you can help partake in.

Let’s stand together apply that same fervor on the following people and organizations who have enabled and worse yet, stood by silent as people got victimized by this doctor and we don’t give them an inch until they

<p>
Kathy Rumer did not reach this point of zero accountability without help. Worse yet, her help came from some of the very people we are supposed to trust . So who is responsible for allowing a monster like Rumer to continue?
</p>
<p>
<em>
Disclaimer: All of the phone numbers posted are their

<strong>

public business numbers.
</em>
</strong>
<em>
If you want to effectively apply public pressure, calling these businesses during their operating hours is a great place to start.
</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Mazzoni Center: Kathy Rumer has made generous donations to the Mazzoni Center in the past who remained completely silent in response to a petition to them for a public statement denouncing Rumer’s litigious SLAPP suit against her own patients. Their entire staff was also emailed a dossier of Rumer’s non surface level atrocities and they remained completely quiet, they’re silence is violence. Here is Mazzoni’s number, call them up and ask them why they won’t denounce Rumer and continue to refer patients to her further endangering the community they claim to provide safe gender affirming care to. 215-563-0652 or 215-563-0658
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to put pressure on the heads of Mazzoni individually, working from this
<a href="https://www.mazzonicenter.org/staff">list
</a>
might help. We would mostly suggest putting pressure on Sultan Shakir, the sitting president of Mazzoni, We highly recommend calling the health center despite this. Annoying the desk reps enough might actually get Mazzoni to finally speak up and say something about Rumer.
</p>
<p>
In regards to Mazzoni we also need to make sure Rumer is permanently banned from attending the annual Trans Health Conference (A wonderful place to distribute the new flyers we are currently producing.) Mazzoni organizes this conference every summer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dr. Marci Bowers MD, the sitting president of WPATH: This doctor has not only been well aware of Rumer having done revisions to ex Rumer patients but has also been
<a href="https://i.redd.it/0f3j1bwaiim91.png">threatened with litigation
</a>
at the hands of Rumer. Despite all of this Marci has remained mostly silent. Marci however just so happens to have the power to drop Rumer from WPATH. Call her office up, ask them why she is allowing an absolute despot like Rumer to continue to have the endorsement of WPATH. (650) 570-2270. Imagine trying to run your surgical clinic and instead of getting calls for consultations you instead get angry calls regarding your continued support of a transphobic doctor.
</li>
<li>
Alexis Lake, Lake Therapy: This therapist serves the Lancaster area which has little to no resources for gender affirming care, not only is she a
<a href="https://i.ibb.co/xJ5RHz9/Lakeand-Rumer.png">personal friend
</a>
of Rumer but actively brags to her own clientele about how many people she refers to Rumer. Worse yet, Lake is possibly getting kickbacks for every patient she refers to Rumer. This must stop immediately. Call her up,

ask her why she is “eagerly” sending her trusting patients to a psychopath like Rumer. (If you really want to get her attention, her google reviews are also a good place to start. Give her some free publicity)

<li>
Roger’s Counsel, Rumer’s Right-Wing ‘Attack Dogs: Did a loved one of yours recently have a surgery with Rumer that they are afraid to speak out about due to how litigious Kathy is? These two men are responsible for that fear,

Lance Rogers and Joe Heffern.

Even beyond trans rights, denying a patient’s right to free speech is reprehensible. Express your first amendment right and let them know what you think.

during business hours, or just leave a message on their google reviews. (Like Alexis Lake, these guys are also deserving of some free publicity.) Ask them all about

Dr. Kathy Rumer Herself: Despite being

</a>
by 600+ people to resign and despite being this infamous, she continues to believe that she is providing us all with an “invaluable service” according to her self-praising responses in her google reviews. Providing an “Invaluable service” to the trans community also means
<strong>
listening
</strong>
to the trans community, nothing for us, without us. Tell her staff how you feel.

. You can also have the pleasure of being labeled as a “transphobic troll” by either her or her staff in their google reviews as they casually admit to violating HIPAA by going through their patient’s records to try to witch hunt you. Also feel free to ask Rumer’s staff why she fraternizes with
<a href="https://i.redd.it/0f3j1bwaiim91.png">registered Republicans
</a>
to silence her own patients. Rumer has also been paying Google and advertising services top dollar to bury negative articles about her and in some cases even delete negative reviews. Her staff use sock accounts to post fake positive reviews on almost a weekly basis. (mass reporting these false positive reviews is also an option) Google means alot to Rumer, let&#39;s declaw her on this front.

Don’t feel comfortable putting public pressure on Rumer and her enablers and still want to help?

Do not worry, direct action takes on many forms.

<strong>
Are You a Graphic Designer?:
</strong>
Rumer has resorted to taking out of state medicaid as a result of her dwindling reputation in PA. This means no city is safe from her reach. Feel free to make flyers to warn your local trans support groups and clinics. Find out if Rumer is attending a trans health conference style convention in your city and let it be known that this doctor is not welcome in any queer space. A decent number of people do not use reddit and with how crippling dysphoria can be they may find themselves going to Rumer completely unaware of her history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Word of Mouth:
</strong>
In addition to putting pressure on Rumer’s allies, you can help put an end to Rumer&#39;s reign simply by just spreading the word. We can beat Rumer through a war of attrition by denying her as many new patients as possible. Share this post! Copy and paste it, mirror it, etc. Spread the word.

<strong>
Stage a Picket:
</strong>
All of the individuals and organizations on the list have a physical place of business, nothing applies pressure more than a dozen people standing outside an office with a megaphone and signs and the first place that should be picketed is most definitely Rumer’s office in Ardmore. This year’s Trans Health Conference in Philly should also be a priority.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Organize, stand up, speak out.
</strong>
Rumer and her allies rely upon silence and fear. Show them what happens when you mess with a community that is used to fighting for their existence on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Do You Know of More Individuals or Organizations Who Have Shielded Rumer From Justice?: Let us know and we will add them to this public list. Any association with this doctor deserves to be career ending and we need to make it a statement that anyone who aids and abets Rumer is to be heckled and shamed.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Until the powerful grow the spine to finally speak up the onus falls upon us to be the vanguard and defend our community from Rumer. We need to stand up for her victims who are too traumatized and afraid to speak out against her. “The Butcher of Ardmore” has continued for long enough. It&#39;s time to take action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
No Justice, No Peace.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
PS: To Kathy Rumer: Consider this your eviction notice.
