My Experience 24 days post op Srs
</p>
<p>
post-op ppt with Dr. Gupta and Dr. Pope at University Hospital in Ohio.
</p>
<p>
11 months from the initial email to Tina (one of the LGBTQA coordinators) to surgery.
</p>
<p>
They wanted the 2 letters by the time you go into the first consult (if they are correct, you will get your surgery date faster, for me it was within a week of going).
</p>
<p>
Surgery was set for July 12, 2022
</p>
<p>
End of March I get an email &#34;A slot opened up; would you like to move your surgery up&#34;. Of course, I did!
</p>
<p>
----EARLY APRIL----
</p>
<p>
I was in a frantic panic, I had already just gotten back into the Gym, but I wanted to be stronger. I started doubling my time going up until 5 days before leaving. I highly recommend that you’re getting the PPT (robotic-assisted) to strengthen your core, I cannot stress this enough. My core is weak right now because I fell off working out consistently just as winter hit. I had also gained 25 pounds since quitting nicotine. My Adderall tolerance went way down, and I had to work with my doctor to get it back up. I can’t stress again; how important it is to stay active and work out. Blood flow baby, blood flow! I did manage to get back down 10-15 pounds before surgery but still sitting around 215-230. The entire time I had to keep reminding myself how much I have gone through and the nicotine thing and binge eating thing. I am winning the slow race and I will reach goals if I just keep going!
</p>
<p>
So…
</p>
<p>
With little time to plan, I scrambled, got an Airbnb near the hospital, and negotiated my stay with a friend for the days I couldn&#39;t book the Airbnb.
</p>
<p>
By the time mid-April had come, I was ready and had all my accommodations set.
</p>
<p>
The new surgery date is 4-22-22 (freaky cool birthday !!!!)
</p>
<p>
April 20th ---
</p>
<p>
I set course for Ohio on 4-20-22 around noonish (it’s a 3-hour drive to the hospital for me) on the way down I grabbed around 500$ worth of weed stuff (Edibles, tinctures, vapes, absolutely no flower for 3-4 weeks after and before surgery) It was 420, all the local dispensaries had insanely good deals, 500$ worth for less than 200$. Getting the weed stuff was such a good choice, getting off the Oxy as soon as you can for multiple reasons is vital (addiction, constipation, nausea).
</p>
<p>
I arrived and met my friend, she let me, and my partner stay in her basement for the 2 nights. We settled in, and I began to try and relax, I stopped most of my meds (vitamins and progesterone) a week before, and on the 21st I stopped everything else.
</p>
<p>
The nights before were insanely nerve-wracking! I stopped smoking/vaping (Zero Nicotine, I quit nicotine 6 months ago in prep for another surgery that never happened) a week before. I took my last edibles on the 20th (the day I arrived) and ate my last meal on the 20th around 5pm and began the bowel prep. The bowel prep wasn’t so bad since I mostly OMAD, my guts were mostly clean.
</p>
<p>
On the 21st I went in for my covid testing.
</p>
<p>
The night before---
</p>
<p>
I could barely sleep or keep my fingernails out of my mouth. I was told to be at the hospital at 5:30 am. The entire night, I couldn’t stop looking at the time. I was so excited and terrified. I have never been under the knife before. 4am rolled around and I got up to take my last pre-surgical shower. I scrubbed all my bits with the special soap they tell you to use.
</p>
<p>
I arrived at the hospital and parked my car in the garage. My partner and I then walked 10 minutes to the surgical wing of the hospital. I got all checked in and then waited about 20 minutes in the lobby, scared to death knowing what I was about to experience (life-changing, things that could go wrong, things that could go right, etc.…).
</p>
<p>
They called me in, I got naked and put on a gown and socks they provided.

First 48 Hours -
</p>
<p>
I was in agony from the GAS. Stomach spasms Oh my!
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t poop at all; everything was kind of in and out as they kept me on narcotics for the first 48 hours until I had them stop. Once I stopped, on the 3rd day I was able to finally poop a little with the help of laxatives and stool softeners. However, it was bedpan poo, and just so you know, I am extremely independent, so going through something like this was intense for me. I wanted nothing to do with being helped by the nurses, but I had no choice.
</p>
<p>
The following days the gas pain (Ask for that GASX chewable) lessoned and on day 3 or 4 I was visited by residents and allowed to finally get up and walk around. Although it was very little, I ended up passing out from exhaustion almost every time in those days. The gas pain from being blown up with CO2 is intense in your shoulders and neck the first week, beware.
</p>
<p>
On the 5th day, Dr. Pope came in and had taken the original packing out and placed it in temporary packing. They wanted to try something new to avoid infections, which is something they had seen in previous patients. So I spent another night in the hospital (just in case) something risky happened, also because my Airbnb wasn’t set up until 2 days from then due to such short notice on the surgery.  With the packing in an extra 5 days, constipation was very very bad, remember to take laxatives!
</p>
<p>
On the 6th day, I got discharged and was hitching a ride with my friend to her house nearby to stay the night until I could check into my Airbnb. I was on edibles the entire time I was in Ohio, so most of the details are still very blurry to me.
</p>
<p>
The following day, a bunch of friends helped me gather my things and we headed over to the Airbnb which was only a few minutes down the road. Once I got there, I was finally able to settle in, although I had an issue with the bed/couch they had so I ordered a king-size luxury air mattress (thank the gods lol).
</p>
<p>
I spent most of the next 7 days in bed, occasionally walking around more and more each day. On the following Monday (the 10th-day post-op) I was scheduled to get my catheter out. Let me tell you, this was amazing. It came out, didn’t hurt or feel weird, just felt amazing. I then dilated for the first time, and it was quite painful.  The nurse on their team was a frekin angel, I&#39;ve never felt more comfortable and cared for in my life, especially learning to dilate from this person for the first time!
</p>
<p>
They left the ureter stent inside of me because getting the catheter out and dilating for the first time was a lot for me at that stage. As I am writing this, I still have the stent in, and I am 9 days from getting it out.

<p>
The following few days, I got better and better, but my energy levels were still super low. I continued to relax and ice my crotch for 15-30 minutes every hour on my pubis (pooch area) and my perineum area.  To be clear, without icing the healing wouldn’t have taken as well, and peeing would of being impossible, you HAVE TO ICE. I am barely over 3 weeks post right now and I’m still icing several times per day.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday comes and I am feeling like 65% and I decide to cancel the rest of my Airbnb and go home which is a 3-hour drive. I am the one driving due to my partner not being a driver currently. The drive home was somewhat decent. I have a Chrysler 300, so I basically reclined myself all the way then loaded the seat with pillows, and got myself into the car as best as I could. Cruise control most of the way was easy, traffic not so much. I also had to stop every 30-45 minutes to pee and walk around, which was good for my head.
</p>
<p>
I got home and was completely wiped out, and since then I have been slowly regaining my strength. The main issue is the stent though. I pushed myself a little too much a few days ago picking up a friend to hang out with and also lost myself standing and painting for several hours (oof). I ended up in so much pain from the stent irritation that I was crying, and let me tell you, as someone who enjoys pain, crying from it is terrifying for me. Luckily, I have pain killers for emergencies (they give you a 20-pill script on your way out).
</p>
<p>
This has happened a couple times now, cleaning my apartment, and going to the store almost killed me again. I guess the tradeoff is I won’t have an infection in my bladder and the stent is just irritating if I’m not careful. I can’t wait till it comes out!
</p>
<p>
So, I consider myself an aggressive healer. I have been intermittent fasting for over 3 years, and I do 72-hour fasts twice a month, a couple 48-hour fasts a month, and 23-27 hour fasts almost every single day. I have had almost no bleeding, almost no pain aside from nerves reconnecting, and random itchiness and sharp pains here and there. I have also had a minimal discharge.  I began Intermittent fasting as soon as I got back home, and I believe it has helped.  Although I have taken a break here or there due to knowing I haven&#39;t had as much protein intake for the day.  Protein is super vital for recovery.
</p>
<p>
I spent the last week and a half at home without panties on in bed with a fan on my crotch. I clean the fibrin out once per day and I have been dilating a little extra due to paranoia about depth in the first few weeks being the most vital for depth.
</p>
<p>
Some tips, if you have addictive problems, try not to be on the narcotics for very long. If you can, get CBD or THC gummies. I also spent the first week of recovery eating smoothies and omelets and that helped a lot. Do not be afraid to take laxatives, it&#39;s worth it even if you poop yourself. Constipation and gas are no joke, get it out however you can without straining yourself.
</p>
<p>
Use a pillow behind you when you sit to use the toilet, and make sure you can distribute your weight correctly without sitting at a 90-degree angle.
</p>
<p>
Water water water water water…. Drink 2 to 3 liters per day.
</p>
<p>
Vitamins:
</p>
<p>
B12 1000mg-5000mg (I personally use 5000mg daily)
</p>
<p>
Magnesium (spectrum ones that cost a little more but help with brain fog and digestion)
</p>
<p>
Fiber gummies
</p>
<p>
Women’s multivitamin
</p>
<p>
Stool Softeners (Kirkland 400count bottle is the cheapest)
</p>
<p>
Supplies:
</p>
<p>
Post-partum cotton underwear (use these, sit on a puppy pad, don’t bother with fem pads if you don’t need to go anywhere, just relax, pads at first irritated my stitching (I have lots of extra skin from weight loss).
</p>
<p>
For the fem pads, I use Posie everyday liners, a regular-length light version. These are the least invasive and are not scraping the sides of my stitching.
</p>
<p>
Get a neck pillow, a memory foam style. That thing was a godsend, I used it 99% of the time the first 2 weeks. You won’t regret it.
</p>
<p>
2 pack of gel ice packs (rotate them, using a sock or cloth over it, never directly on the skin)
</p>
<p>
A reach grabber, with grip and magnet
</p>
<p>
A comfy robe
</p>
<p>
A tablet or phone “gooseneck” mount. This came in real handy just being able to adjust it to where it was comfortable and not needing to move much to touch the screen or watch things.
</p>
<p>
Washable bed pads, I have 2 of them and they are great for laying in bed without underwear on!
</p>
<p>
Buy a box of Surgilube, you will be using a ton of this to dilate.
</p>
<p>
A battery-powered fan with grippy legs, I use this to dry my crotch area after a shower.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you have a blow dryer you can use immediately after showering; you won’t get completely dry right away but that’s really for when you are just getting out of the shower.
</p>
<p>
A USB ring light with the clamp so you can see your stuff conveniently for cleaning and dilating.
</p>
<p>
A small personal mirror for looking and cleaning.
</p>
<p>
Baby wipes, LOTS of baby wipes!
</p>
<p>
A douche bottle (any kind, I use a full silicon one it&#39;s easy to clean and flexible)
</p>
<p>
Extra towels, to place over your pee pad in bed, so you have to re-wash them less.
</p>
<p>
Baby shampoo for the first couple of months of by washing around the area gently.
</p>
<p>
Iodine 10% (the PPT vagina may have an odor while healing the first 1 to 6 months, I’m told a drop of Iodine solution if your douche will help with the slight odor. And there is a slight odor when you are drying yourself in bed.
</p>
<p>
Yoga blocks, I use to hold my legs apart in bed while sitting on my side with an ice pack on my crotch. And while that is going on, I have the small fan in the back keeping everything dry.
</p>
<p>
Keep toilet paper (the soft cushy kind) nearby while bed resting without underwear on. Sometimes you might get a leak here or there that requires a tiny dab of TP, remembering to keep everything dry as possible consistently.
</p>
<p>
Gauze pads or gauze rolls and wound wash solution. When it comes to the crusty yellow stuff, it&#39;s discharged from healing and the gland above the urethra. I take some gauze, drop some solution on it and simply dab the fibrin very gently, and then even leave the gauze on for a short time. Pulling it off will remove the fibrin and allow more air to go in and keep things nice clean and dry.
</p>
<p>
Optional, I have ordered a felt cushioned toilet seat cover. This allows my bum to relax a bit more when sitting down on the toiled. And again, it’s a personal preference.
</p>
<p>
The blow-up air mattress with max height. And this is if you are staying somewhere with a high up bed that&#39;s hard to get out of, you want to make sure you can log roll out of bed and get your legs to the ground without much strain or discomfort. For me personally, this was the best route.
</p>
<p>
If you have any metal piercings (nipples, ears, lips, anything) get surgical plastic placeholder jewelry. I personally had to take my lip rings out completely (not a big deal they didn’t close) but they also wanted me to take out my metal nipple piercings and I had ordered plastic placeholders that they said were fine to keep in. Any metal piercings will need to be either replaced with a plastic or taken out.
</p>
<p>
Comfy slippers and or comfy socks for the duration.
</p>
<p>
Loose-fitting yoga pants or easy on skirts for going anywhere
</p>
<p>
Finally, a power strip with like a 10-foot extension cord is built into it. This is priceless when you have to be in a hospital bed and need to have things plugged in within arm’s reach.

<p>
For context, a few years ago I was almost 400 lbs., I was down to 205 then quit nicotine 6 months ago in prep for surgery. I gain 25ish lbs. and the surgeons I went to didn’t bat an eye. They don’t gatekeep. I just want to say though, that getting in shape beforehand is extremely important, especially for your core. You want to have as much core strength as possible going into laparoscopic surgery. I had the issue of being super depressed over the winter and didn’t work out, but luckily, I worked out before winter, and I was working out 6 or so weeks before surgery again. I managed to get myself back to 215ish before surgery and it wasn’t nearly as bad as I could have imagined.
</p>
<p>
To touch base on post-op depression, it exists. I am constantly finding ways to reach out and have conversations with people every day via voice or video chat. This is vital to your mental health in recovery. Don’t waste time, make the first move and initiate conversations. It also helps time fly by.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, I’m 24 days post-op as of today and I’m feeling ok.  Lethargy is a thing, and due to the nature of my work, I have been working on and off since I got back home. Unfortunately, since I am a freelancer, I have no choice but to keep working. If you do not have to work, please wait the 6 weeks, recover, and relax. It’s a lot to put on yourself.
</p>
<p>
I also want to point out that some people who are post-op will boast about being mobile and going back to regular life as soon as (Day(s)) the after surgery. That is messed up, don’t risk any complications, it&#39;s not worth it, it&#39;s permanent. The first few weeks are vital, keep those stitches nice and clean, and work on taking your time. I personally am super hyper-vigilant, I am always on the move, this has been the hardest challenge, and I have paid for it several times since being back due to my stent.
</p>
<p>
The work Dr. Gupta and Dr. Pope have done on me has been phenomenal. Everything looks amazing, especially since I have hanging skin from weight loss. I have had almost zero bleeding, and zero problems with stitching coming out (although some appear loose, they are still intact and doing fine). Dilating is a bit rough due to the stent, but that’s expected. The treatment in post-op care at the hospital was TOP NOTCH. They put you in the post-surgical ward for cancer patients. The view was amazing, the room was amazing, and the nurses were amazing heroes who take care of some of the sickest people who struggle. At some point, I had to tell them that I was fine and that I didn’t need all the attention. I was worried for the other patients around me. But I made sure my needs were definitely met.
</p>
<p>
The program at University Hospital is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll attach some photos of my room to this post as well as what my insurance is covering off the bat. I will probably have to have their team go to work with my insurance company to cover more of the surgery and double-check all the charges. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, PPO Silver (Anthem, who owns University Hospital btw). They billed my insurance 105.5k so far and covered 90.5k so far. As of right now, it looks like I will be paying around 13k out of pocket, but my out-of-pocket max currently is about 4k, and my deductible is at 400$ left out of pocket. So, we will see. I don’t think I will end up paying the entire 13k.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask me anything at this point!

Just scheduled my consult with Dr. Gupta on Jan. 16th, anything you wished you asked or new before or after the procedure, and are you happy with how it look post 6 months at this point? Traveling from Marion, OH so want to go armed with plenty of information as I can get.
