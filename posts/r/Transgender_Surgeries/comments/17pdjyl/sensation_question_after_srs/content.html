Hey all, I&#39;m curious if anyone else has had issues with sensation returning, I&#39;m 8 months post op, I can orgasm and penetration feels good due to the gspot but my touch sensation is gone from mid labia down. I can feel pressure but not simply touch.
</p>
<p>
I know I&#39;m supposed to wait a year but 8 months without any changes feels like this is how its going to be. Is there any hope of it getting better or anything changing and if not is there anything I can do about it?
</p>

Generally speaking, as long as there isn&#39;t any funny business with the surgeon, the procedure, complications, healing issues, etc, you should be fully sensate after surgery, and what you&#39;re describing doesn&#39;t sound totally typical. It&#39;s been about 2 years for me since surgery with Dr Bowers, and I don&#39;t exactly recall if I was in the same situation as you 8 months out, but I don&#39;t think I was. I think everything was having sensitivity return and done by around months 3 months or so, that&#39;s when I remember the little zingers fading away. Definitely reach out to your surgeon if you have concerns, or if things don&#39;t continue to improve in the near future. Congratulations on your surgery though! I hope you are thrilled with your cosmetic results

I am pretty happy except it looks a bit strange internally. But thank you. I did tell him and he was surprised.

[you should be fully sensate after surgery]
</p>
<p>
This is definitely not the norm. Expect considerable neural disruption, and full recovery can take over a year.
