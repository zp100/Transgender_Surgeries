I no longer have access to the ghosting that happened when my mom messaged her as well but this is a pretty average Bowers back and forth. Something goes wrong, you contact the office, they tell you to contact Bowers and she either doesn&#39;t answer your question fully OR she just straight up doesn&#39;t respond
</p>

I noticed something like this in that TV series with her, I am Jazz. She’s the surgeon in charge until there’s a problem, then it’s Jess  Ting.

My housemate had surgery with her (it took 5 years, she had to make a fuss to get a sooner date because they were just going to let more time drag on) last year, housemate developed an infection and asked for antibiotics. The office told her there’s no way she had an infection and didn’t want to prescribe antibiotics. Well, she did indeed have an infection. If she hadn’t insisted on antibiotics it could have been bad.

I literally had to demand care from their office multiple times. My labia straight up died and they were sitting there on the phone saying &#34;there&#39;s no way it&#39;s dying&#34;

I&#39;ll be making a main post on here very shortly, I just wanted to get the screenshots uploaded while I still had the mental bandwidth to do so. I plan on documenting my experience from start to finish including my revisions and whatnot.

I have heard similar things, Bowers has a terrible reputation on the dl for a good reason. The fact she is most famous for botching the surgery of America&#39;s most famous transkid is disheartening. Bowers is a fraud and always has been, she is in no position to chair WPATH.

TBH after hearing her speak at oSTEM&#39; GAC symposium, I&#39;m not super surprised. Lots about how great she was, her accomplishments, etc, not much else about anything else

At the oSTEM conference a few years ago (2020-2021, can&#39;t remember which), they held a gender affirmation symposium on the last day, and Bowers was the main speaker

Her saying &#39;yuh nasty&#39; to a genuine medical concern, which she should have a lot of professional experience with and know how vulnerable this time is for patients.... so incredibly unprofessional and immature. She really needs a license review and a reality check

Update: I just got a call/some messages from Bowers, apparently she saw my post and disagrees with the way that I framed this quote &#34;Bowers refused to send me there because, to quote her &#39;my works good enough that I don&#39;t have to send people there.&#39;&#34;
<br>
This is the way that I remember this conversation happening in the office when I told her how amazing the oxygen therapy clinic was and asked her why she doesn&#39;t send everyone there. As you can see in my screenshots, she clearly did eventually suggest sending me there, but she sent me there AFTER my labia died, sending me there sooner MAY have saved my labia and thats where my frustration comes from.
<br>
She also sent me some screenshots of questions that I asked her where she did respond, so Ill be adding those to my main post when I get that up.
<br>
Hope this clears things up for anyone who may think I presented things unfairly.
