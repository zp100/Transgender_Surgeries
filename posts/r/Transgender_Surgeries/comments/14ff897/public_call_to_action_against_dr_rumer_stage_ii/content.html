Dr. Kathy Lynn Rumer is a GCS surgeon who operates out of Ardmore PA and has a long history of botching her patients, ghosting and gaslighting her patients when they have complications and hiring right-wing, ex Trump affiliated lawyers to silence said patients. Dr. Rumer targets low income patients who rely on medicaid and do not have the resources to either fight back or risk going public about their surgery in the event they receive a subpoena from her legal team. Dr. Rumer is even willing to go as far as to
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16770312/delaware-valley-aesthetics-pllc-v-john-doe-1/">drag her trans patients</a>
in front of a
<a href="https://epgn.com/2020/12/15/judge-suspends-new-antibias-rule-for-pa-attorneys/">Trump appointed, anti-LGBTQ judge</a>
, in front of a jury to put her patients genitals up for public scrutiny. In a time when republican fascists are rolling back trans rights this is absolutely unacceptable from a doctor who claims to be providing (by her words) an
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/4SJVf2M.png">“invaluable service to the trans community.”</a>
</p>
<p>
Why does this matter? Because WPATH and the powers that be have absolutely failed to hold Dr. Rumer accountable. For a decade she has dodged accountability while leaving a bloody trail of broken bodies in her wake. Kathy Rumer has made it a tactic to bully her own patients and detractors into silence using her immense wealth and the legal system, even going as far as to threaten journalists and other doctors. Rumer’s stranglehold of fear over the trans community and institutions leaves her victims with few places to turn to speak out. The few patients who do speak out not only risk losing everything in one of
<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16770312/delaware-valley-aesthetics-pllc-v-john-doe-1/">Dr Rumer’s SLAPP suits</a>
, but also have to worry about TERFs and far-right thugs who will continue to have a monopoly over this if nothing is done. Dr. Kathy Rumer is a threat to the entire trans community and we must defend her victims and put an end to her surgical practice, silence is violence.

Petition calling for Dr. Rumer’s Resignation
</strong>
</p>

</p>
<h1>
(Please save a copy of this entire list with the URL formatting intact, we will get to that reasoning in a bit.)
</h1>
<p>
So what can be done about Rumer in a complacent medical and legal system? The way we’ve always had to defend our right to exist. Direct action and pure solidarity.
</p>
<p>
We’ve already had a moderately successful call to action, flyers warning against Rumer’s practice have been spread across Center City Philadelphia. Mazzoni has silently cut ties from Dr. Rumer and her practice, inside sources confirm this as well as the current Trans Health Conference lineup as well as Mazzoni’s list of practitioners have delisted Rumer. Local therapists in the Philly area as well as the mid-PA such as Allentown area have blacklisted Dr. Rumer for surgery referrals and the required letter from a therapist. Rumer’s lawyer who participated in the harassment of two trans women dropped out of a local race for judge after public pressure. Rumer is now known colloquially as the “Butcher of Ardmore” in the local area and abroad. Direct action always gets the goods but there is still work to be done.
</p>
<p>
While the amount of horror stories have significantly decreased after the Petition and Outfront article. There are still people coming forward on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transgender_surgeries/">r/transgender_surgeries</a>
who have consultations coming up with Dr. Rumer and are rightfully asking questions.
<strong>
But what about those who aren’t reddit savvy? We need to protect them at all costs.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Speaking of reddit, the list above of Rumer’s actions and lawsuits should be saved with the links intact if you want to participate in direct action to warn any prospective Rumer customer. Admins of the various surgery subreddits could greatly help by creating an auto response bot which lists these anytime the keyword “Rumer” is mentioned.
</p>
<h1>
A Battle Plan
</h1>
<p>
Currently Dr. Rumer is drawing in new patients from three major sources. In order to win,
<strong>
we must dismantle Dr. Rumer’s remaining infrastructure.
</strong>
Let’s start with the first two which have more of a chance of making an impact.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
WPATH and Marci Bowers: Without a WPATH membership, Rumer will find it VERY difficult to practice reputably anywhere. During our last call to action we named and shamed Marci Bowers for her failure to revoke Dr. Rumer’s WPATH membership
<a href="https://www.wpath.org/member/794">(which is still active).</a>
We encouraged people to flood her office with calls and so on, and a few people even commented on her
<a href="https://i.redd.it/dpri8hlebara1.jpg">instagram</a>
where Bowers left a juicy response.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>
“She is a huge problem. I have lobbied those with potential to address this through Pennsylvania medical board but, as WPATH president, not in my jurisdiction. buyer beware”
</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Marci does indeed have the authority to revoke Rumer’s WPATH membership as she is the
</strong>
<a href="https://www.wpath.org/about/EC-BOD"><strong>
WPATH President.
</strong></a>
This response was performative as
<a href="https://jezebel.com/when-surgeons-fail-their-trans-patients-1844774990?rev=1597854733082">the medical board in PA has ignored a decade’s worth of complaints.</a>
Unlike the last call to action, this time we aren’t going to call her office. As stated earlier, Marci has a very open and very public
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/marcibowers76/">Instagram</a>
, as well as google reviews to get loud in. We need to make it known that if you associate with or harbor Dr. Rumer you will have a PR migraine. Especially the head of the organization who sets the standards for trans care.
</p>
<p>
<em>
I also want to note that if this fails we will be launching a petition, flyers, and organized action that will be dedicated to Dr. Bowers
</em>
<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10058951/Leading-transgender-medics-warn-children-given-gender-reassignment-surgery.html"><em>
who already has a checkered history as she collaborated with Matt Walsh (a prominent fascist) in his documentary against trans women.
</em></a>
<em>
We will also be encouraging people to donate to alternative organizations to WPATH. If your organization cannot protect patients against abusive practitioners like Rumer then your organization doesn’t deserve to have any credibility professionally.
</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.transhealthcare.org/kathy-rumer/">Transhealthcare.org:</a>
Dr. Rumer is directly paying this site to advertise in their directory of surgeons. This
<a href="https://www.transhealthcare.org/kathy-rumer/">page</a>
needs to go. There is a
<a href="https://www.transmedianetwork.com/contact/">contact here</a>
for the webmaster but better yet he has a
<a href="https://twitter.com/transguys">twitter account</a>
where he is quite active. Like Bowers, you know what to do.
</li>
<li>
Google: Rumer has been paying an ad service to flood google with advertising and to bury any and all negative press about her. She also must be working with Google directly as anytime you go to report one of her numerous fake positive reviews for “conflict of interest” google registers it as “spam,” It also appears that anytime someone leaves a negative review, it gets shadowbanned.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We need to boost the following pages so they can reach the top of Google searches for “Kathy Rumer” and “Rumer Cosmetics” and put an end to Rumer’s astroturfing.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.change.org/p/kathy-rumer-must-resign?recruiter=1273154371&amp;recruited_by_id=e0ccb890-15aa-11ed-8e8a-1139b8c2be18&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=share_for_starters_page&amp;utm_medium=copylink">Change.org: Kathy Rumer Must Resign</a>
</p>
<p>
For those who want to publicly ask Rumer why she has failed to take accountability on her Google reviews for “Rumer Cosmetics” Her questions are wide open, and it also seems leaving a “5 star” review doesn’t seem to get filtered and you can ask her whatever you desire. She enjoys making fake positive reviews about herself, how about we help her out in that but with a twist?
</p>
<h1>
When injustice like this becomes the status quo we must act. Our sisters at Stonewall would have never tolerated an abusive and litigious bully like Dr. Rumer, and neither should we. Let&#39;s show Rumer and all who enable her what trans power and liberation looks like. No Justice. No Peace.

Thank you for putting this out there. This monster and all of her cronies need to be stopped. It&#39;s amazing how corrupt this world has become, even Google supports her by shadow banning negative reviews. At that point, what the hell is the point of the review system?

Glad to see Rumer getting her comeuppance. No doctor should be able to take their patients to court for giving their honest opinion about their results.

At least the (different) doctor who botched my first surgery was just incompetent, rather than actively trying to deceive and harm people.,,
