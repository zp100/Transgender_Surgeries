Hello, I&#39;m a circumcised pre-op trans woman. I could be wrong about this, but I feel like the best looking SRS results come from people who weren&#39;t circumcised. Has anyone else noticed this? I hope that my own surgery will go well in spite of being circumcised.

On average it&#39;s probably true that uncircumcised people get better results (depth or cosmetic), just due to the extra source tissue. I suspect it depends a lot on the surgeon and the technique though. For a standard PI I don&#39;t think it would make much, if any difference. For a Thai inversion or PPT it might be more significant, but a skilled surgeon can still work around that to produce a good result.

It&#39;s also worth pointing out that just from the few examples I&#39;ve seen, a person&#39;s
<em>
size
</em>
pre-op is a better predictor of post-op cosmetic result than if they&#39;re circumcised. It&#39;s like, the total skin surface area, multiplied by the surgeon&#39;s skill, plus or minus how well you heal afterward, gives your final result. That&#39;s my half-assed formula, anyway.

So if one were circumcised, but their natal genitals measured in the 7+ inches ball park, thereâ€™s still hope for successful GCS?

Why would foreskin be more significant for PPT?

I had bottom surgery a few months ago, and literally asked my surgeon this exact question.  Their answer was &#34;It really doesn&#39;t matter&#34;.  They explained that the skin in the foreskin is different than most of the other penile tissue, and was more like tissue paper.  As a result, it was more likely to tear.  Because of this, even though I was not circumcised, they weren&#39;t going to use the tissue.

I struggled with this.  Iâ€™m not circumcised and wanted to go to Thailand, but covid.  In Thailand and Germany their surgical technique is different than here in the us.  There they use the frenulum and foreskin for labia minora.  Plus the vestibule has a nice pink skin.   In the us they donâ€™t do this because most were trained in the standard PIV technique.  So the answer is generally that if you get PIV in the us then it doesnâ€™t really make a difference.  But if you have a foreskin, then you have more options on how to use that tissue.

Cosmetically I think it looks good, and I&#39;m happy; I think realistic expectations are important. X

I havenâ€™t noticed this, and donâ€™t know why it would make a difference in penile inversion with scrotal grafts or PPT.

Yikes. So do ptâ€™s with circumcised natal genitals have poorer results from GCS? ðŸ˜¥

Circumcising babies is unfortunately really common in the US (at least compared to other countries I know of), but a lot of trans women here seem to have successful GCS. Many report sensitive clitorisâ€™. I know foreskin is supposed to help the head of the penis be more sensitive, but other than additional material to line the vaginal canal with, I donâ€™t understand how it would make much difference.

Oh, I see. I always thought the foreskin made the head itself more sensitive, rather than being erogenous itself. I can definitely see how having it lining the vaginal canal would be more pleasurable (assuming nerves stay intact) for the post op trans woman. But I guess a lot of American trans women donâ€™t have anything to compare it to you know? Itâ€™s harder to see your results not being as good if you never experienced something before. Kind of like how coke taste differently in different parts of the world.

Yeah, I think itâ€™d be hard to tell the difference especially if youâ€™ve never had the chance to experience having foreskin. I know a lot of US trans women report the ability to orgasm and experience pleasure post op so I think we all are capable of making the best of what we have. ðŸ˜Š
