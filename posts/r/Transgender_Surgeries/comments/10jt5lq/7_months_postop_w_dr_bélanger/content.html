There is some hypergranulation at the entrance of the canal, this is being treated with silver nitrate and cortisol cream. There is still inflammation on the small lips
</p>
<p>
Pain is still an issue, but I can’t do much about that. Otherwise, it’s still an amazing improvement for my mental health

How is the pain? Is it just when dilating?

Yes primarily while dilating due to the hypergranulation. I just take a little more time to insert it inside compared to other girls.

So sounds like the pain isn&#39;t a huge deal a bigger concern is just how long it takes?

I can’t tolerate the dilation unless I take some Tylenol and Advil. Overall it takes about 15 minutes more than it should if it wasn’t for the pain.
</p>
<p>
The time wasted from pain gives me less time to work and do things, which leads to stress, which in my case leads to psychotic symptoms due to my schizophrenia.
</p>
<p>
So for anyone that doesn’t have a Duo-Tang full of mental illnesses, it shouldn’t be a big deal

You need both to dilate? Even after 7 months? That seems like a ton of pain!
</p>
<p>
Also yea that sounds like the psychotic symptoms wouldn&#39;t be good!
</p>
<p>
I have a pile of mental illnesses so stress could cause issues

Pain is annoying, but it was at the bottom of my surgery anxiety list since it doesn’t leave any permanent traces.
</p>
<p>
Are you in the process of getting the surgery?

Ah that is nice that pain is not a big anxiety item for you!
</p>
<p>
I recently came out as trans and so have been looking into surgery as that is my biggest area of dysphoria. I funny enough was fantasizing about vaginoplasty way back when I thought I was cis.
</p>
<p>
I have a lot of surgery trauma though from the intersex surgeries that I had from ages 2-5 so the prospect of even
<em>
more
</em>
surgery is very frightening.
</p>
<p>
But if I want it done need to decide who now so that I can get on their waitlists, so
<em>
really
</em>
want,
<em>
really
</em>
scared kinda thing.

Yeah I understand why it’s a challenging decision given your circumstances. At least I can say that if you’re getting it at GRS Montreal, they’re going to give you excellent care and service.
</p>
<p>
The staff is very friendly, the surgeons are incredibly chill, the food was delicious and had vegan alternatives, and most importantly they listen to your concerns. They’re going to help you if you’re in pain or having difficulties.

I went zero depth and that was the surgeon I was assigned. My roommate there insisted on Belanger over Brassard (for full depth).
</p>
<p>
I have some issues with with them as a surgeon, how they handled me as a patient, and the aesthetics I was left with (feel free to creep my profile, deets are in there - but note, a lot of that was written in a post op depression, and I&#39;m much more chill about said issues these days (like a 4/10 to then 9/10 it was then))

When do you find time to apply ice? I basically don’t have any time in a day to stop everything and put ice on it for a while

When did you go back to work? I did most of my icing in the first month when I was still low energy.

I had about a month and a half off work and because of the pain they recommend to continue applying ice, but I couldn’t really do that if I’m at work all day and busy the evening

Hii! You look great! I wanted to know how did you pay for the surgery? Did you pay with insurance or out of pocket and if you paid with insurance, what insurance did you use? And how much did it cover??
