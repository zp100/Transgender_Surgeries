I can&#39;t believe a hospital is allowed to treat someone this way. I&#39;m sorry you had to experience that and I hope your gf has fully recovered

To be honest your description of the surgery is pretty standard. Not sure how you both were unaware that it is literally hell on earth after it occurs. I am sorry you couldn&#39;t stay with her there. It is ridiculous how hospitals don&#39;t allow that.
</p>
<p>
As for the hospital, i think you need to take into account almost all hospitals are short staffed and there are very few nurses available due to covid. Many have quit and the few that haven&#39;t are dealing with a crisis. Nurses are assigned to an unrealistic number of patients. I had a pretty similar experience. I literally had to hold up my own ice packs. It took 25 minutes for a nurse to arrive when i paged them. There were bodily fluids everywhere, between vomit, blood, urine. I had to crawl to a toilet. I forcefully checked myself out of the hospital knowing my partner would take better care of me.
</p>
<p>
I think people should take this as a caution to not have major elective surgeries at hospitals right now unless it is truly outpatient and less of a statement of the doctor (unless they have actually committed malpractice).

Nope, wrong. I had 12 hour full face surgery in Nov 2020, smackdab during covid and it wasn&#39;t half this bad. Stop victim blaming. It&#39;s well known medical staff neglect trans patients.

I&#39;m so sorry that happened to your partner and you. I think we should be careful here since someone is asking for support here, and this seems kind of horrific to me.

It sounds to me like you didn&#39;t do enough research. Her whole face has had reconstruction of course it will look shocking after and she will have to stay the night. The Dr shouldn&#39;t have downplayed it but you should have also done research outside of the hospital to find out exactly what you&#39;re in for. Also as far as ignoring her goes, hospitals are severely understaffed. A huge amount of staff have left to find better work, and a lot of specialist nurses have been sent to work in main hospitals to help with the overflow of Corona patients. Also you are actually allowed to leave a patient in urine for a unspecified amount of time just as long as it doesn&#39;t cause any harm to the skin. and most likely you couldn&#39;t stay with her because of Corona restrictions

Did I miss the part where she was mistreated? Tbh it just sounds like you weren’t mentally prepared to see her after surgery

Yeah you did… she was left in her own urine for over an hour, nurses wouldn’t respond to her calls, and her pain was not treated properly

It sounds like the three big issues were a gross misrepresentation of recovery time, being booted from her vulnerable partner’s side on the first overnight, and the surgeon not being available to approve aftercare / adjust the care plan.
</p>
<p>
Two of those (misrepresenting what recovery would look like and being unavailable) are on the surgeon.  The other is on hospital staff / policy.

I don’t know about you all but the part about the nurses ignoring her for over an hour and leaving her to sit in her own urine is totally horrifying to me.

Yes there are some issues here.  But they are more caused by hospital policy and less by Surgeon mistakes.  Would it be great if Dr. Kaoutzanis had a better system to deal with post care... absolutely no questions asked.  But this isn&#39;t a unique problem and many surgeons are stuck with poor hospital post care.
</p>
<p>
Its unfortunate that post surgery health care isn&#39;t very good, but more so its unfortunate that MANY hospitals don&#39;t allow a caretaker to watch after their loved one for the night.
</p>
<p>
Huge hugs I hope she recovers well afterward!

<p>
That&#39;s unfortunate, being rude to people isn&#39;t warranted and its certainly something I hate.  And will avoid doctors that are rude for whatever reason (other than having a bad day and needing a hug themselves).

everything seemed normal to me too, until i got to the part where the nurses ignored her. i woke up from FFS in a similar state, but i had very attentive nurses so the night after wasn’t terrible. i couldn’t imagine getting through that without the constant care from staff that i got.
