Hi so I had GRS about 2 1/2 months ago and since like last week I had some flap of tissue just inside the entrance to the vaginal canal. It is bright red and before dilation it basically covers the canal until the dilator just pushes it to the side. Up until a week ago there was no tissue there at all and it just looked like how I imagine the entrance should be...
</p>
<p>
My surgeon is over 2700 miles away so I can‚Äôt go to them. I emailed pictures but didn‚Äôt get a response. I went to a VA hospital and the PA or whatever. She probably really didn‚Äôt know what she was doing... the most disturbing part was her asking me ‚Äúis this where your vaginal canal is or where you pee from?‚Äù I‚Äôm just thinking are you fucking kidding me?? Like hello, I realize it‚Äôs not an exact replica but this is anatomy 101 and I‚Äôm pretty sure it looks good enough to be able to tell, that aside... She just looked at the entrance with a flashlight took a swab to get tested for bacteria and gave me antibiotics because I complained about a slight smell. (Still getting a slight smell every now and then since a week now) I asked for her to use silver nitrate and she said no you‚Äôre not bleeding right now so why would we do that? I didn‚Äôt argue with her, I just kind of got mentally frustrated and went home wondering why the hell I even bothered and felt like the appointment was a waste of my time and all I accomplished  was to make another woman feel uncomfortable....
</p>
<p>
I saw silver nitrate sticks online for like 7$.. in thinking about buying them and getting the job done myself. Is this an awful idea or no? I can‚Äôt afford to go to a non-VA doctor because I‚Äôm broke RN and they won‚Äôt give me a gyno appointment in a soon enough time frame (leaving for a 6 month trip to France in 2 weeks) Only way I‚Äôll be seen is by the same non PHD person who makes me feel like I‚Äôm putting her in an awkward situation. Was considering just going to the ER at the VA at like 1 in the morning to see someone who would obviously specialize in wound care and could possibly do it but that‚Äôs like.. last resort sort of thing. I don‚Äôt want to pretend I‚Äôm smarter than medical people but this sort of thing makes me wonder how some of these people even make it through their medical training. Guess education doesn‚Äôt prepare you enough for actual practice and application.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe just having this flap of tissue is completely fucking normal, I‚Äôm crazy/paranoid and it‚Äôll eventually go away ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

If you don&#39;t know whether that flap of tissue is completely fucking normal then you don&#39;t know whether you&#39;d be using the silver nitrate needlessly. Personally I think it&#39;d be impossible to do this on yourself without damaging healthy tissue.
</p>
<p>
I would phone the surgeons office and remind them you sent photos and need a response.

Will do ! If they don‚Äôt answer I‚Äôll probably end up doing it myself if they do I can get a professional to do it because I can just show them what the doctor said, I don‚Äôt want the tissue there at all!

Please don&#39;t do it yourself, you have no idea of the quality of those silver nitrate sticks and even if they&#39;re decent I just can&#39;t see that you&#39;ll be physically able to do a good job. Do you want to end up with a scarred vulva?
</p>
<p>
Maybe it was an oversight that they didn&#39;t answer the email, none of us are perfect. But you need to pursue them till you do get an answer to your issue. Then you&#39;ll have an actual understanding of what&#39;s wrong (or not) and if there is an issue get someone local to fix it but please please don&#39;t do it yourself.

I had an oestrogen implant in my belly, I&#39;m an RN so I took the two stitches out myself at home, it was actually quite difficult to do on myself. So trying to apply silver nitrate to my vulva I just can&#39;t imagine being able to do as it&#39;s even further away and you have to be very precise when using silver nitrate.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t see you should have issues getting a response from the surgeon.

Why was it difficult? Its seems like it would be quite easy to remove stitches.

It&#39;s more the angle you&#39;re trying to do it from when you&#39;re looking down your body at the sutures. When normally you&#39;re leaning in and above the suture line so have a great view. A mirror wasn&#39;t much use either.
</p>
<p>
Of course in my case they&#39;re technically easy to take out as you&#39;re not having to deal with old blood and hair matted into the suture line or sutures that have been left in too long or fragile older skin. Sometimes it can be a bit of a challenge especially if you care about not hurting the patient and damaging healthy tissue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had lots of plastic surgery for burns to my hand and after one surgery there was a mix up with when the sutures should come out (their error). So they were left in too long and the nurse ended up having to get her knee pressed against my hip while she pulled with all her strength to get them out. Not the most pleasant experience.

And the nurses always make it look so easy.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t know about leaving them in too long. I&#39;m definitely going to more pay attention to what the doctor tells me next time. I assume from that the ones that are meant to be left in a long time are the disolvable ones?

It&#39;s a nurses job to make things look easy... üòä I should probably take up poker as usually when I&#39;m worried things are going to go south the patient can&#39;t see the level of my worry.
</p>
<p>
It inspires confidence when someone looks competent. Having said that I always talk patients through what I&#39;m doing and if it&#39;s difficult I tell them and apologise that it may hurt a bit.
</p>
<p>
The dissolvable ones generally don&#39;t need any follow-up, they just dissolve and fall out. It&#39;s always good to check when sutures go in to ask if they&#39;re dissolvable and if not when they need to come out. It&#39;s not pleasant for anyone pulling out old sutures.

Be careful if you do it. I&#39;ve read a couple of posts on susans where doctors did it badly and it sealed up the urethra. That&#39;s an emergency trip to hospital when you can&#39;t pee.
</p>
<p>
Personally I wouldn&#39;t risk it.

Geez that‚Äôs crazy because it really doesn‚Äôt seem that hard, I guess my surgeon just makes it look simple af... But what choice do I have here ugh. I thought the stick just had a dry coat that the tissue would absorb when in contact with it.  I read that you can also neutralize the reaction with .9% + Saline solution (salt/water mixture should work fine) so worst case scenario I have that option...

How long have you been dealing with this issue? Just wondering. I messaged Chettawut&#39;s staff and they basically told me to sit on my hands and wait for it to heal. Very helpful.

The problem occurred as the skin healed over the urethra. I think they just applied it in the wrong place. But who knows what else could go wrong - I&#39;d not have thought of this problem if I hadn&#39;t read about it.
</p>
<p>
You could probably search and find medical books and papers in how to use silver nitrate.

Silver nitrate is corrosive. You might get yourself burnt. Like
<a href="/u/pyorre6" rel="nofollow">u/pyorre6

said, you should try to contact your surgeon until you get an answer to your issue.

I also feel like I have some extra tissue inside the canal, but I haven&#39;t been able to look inside. My canal is fairly tight. When I put the dilator, about 1 inch in, it seems to struggle to get past... something. It wasn&#39;t like this before. And it hurts a bit.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t found a doctor yet and I am not traveling to freaking Thailand again, so I am enduring the pain. I didn&#39;t know you could even buy silver nitrate without a prescription, but I have the question: What happens if you drop the nitrate on non granulation tissue areas?

Id imagine it would hurt like hell. You can buy sticks! I didn‚Äôt look for liquid or anything. I had planned on buying a stick and putting neosporin or something around the tissue Incase I accidentally brush something else, and just swiping the tissue once with the stick and see what happens, and keep doing it as needed. The tissue growth doesn‚Äôt seem to have any feeling of pain unless it‚Äôs pulled on and then it hurts at where it‚Äôs attached so I don‚Äôt expect to feel any pain.

Hm, that is the issue. I don&#39;t have a good view of inside my canal. I will try looking inside after dilation later to see if there is really extra tissue, but the pain and the struggle to get even the smallest dilator inside seems to support the idea that there is. And I am one month and five days post-OP, so the timing fits.
</p>
<p>
How are those sticks? Do you have a link to them?

I have, but like I said, my canal is not that large. I was looking at it with the Hello Kitty mirror just a few minutes ago and I can&#39;t see shit inside. Maybe after dilation.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, after researching a bit about silver nitrate, doing it by oneself seems like a recipe for disaster, especially on skin inside such a tight place. If it falls on other skin/flesh, it will burn and damage it. Maybe you have the dexterity to pull it off, but I sure as hell don&#39;t.

Yes it‚Äôs very caustic. Which is why I‚Äôm a little hesitant. But I did notice how my doctor would treat it before I left and he would just tap spots with the stick and that‚Äôs it. Seems simple enough idk &gt;&lt;

The sticks I found to buy seem to drop droplets of the substance, which is why I am scared. :c At any rate, granulation goes away after a few weeks, so worst case scenario I will just endure this shit for a bunch of more days

It did not for me - I required treatment. Hyper granulation can necessitate surgical treatment at times.

Alright, I should have said it can go away on its own (according to numerous medical sites I read). I hope it does for me as Chett insists I shouldn&#39;t go to another doc for two more months.

Your surgeon not responding to you is unacceptable. Call them until they do respond, and in the meantime, please don&#39;t use silver nitrate on yourself!

Hi, I have a couple of questions: how was your recovery until now?, how was your surgeon? And how do you conserve your results in terms of cosmetics, sensitivity and depth?

I think my recovery is fine and is still fine.. I personally really like my surgeon and they were good, I don‚Äôt have a follow up because I moved so that kind of screwed myself. Cosmetic and depth is maintained through dilating properly and often. Also for cosmetic I have constantly been aware of any rogue tissue and would take care of it if I could. The follow ups allowed for touch ups too. I‚Äôd have an appointment in a week or two if I was still around and this would be a non-(t)issue... Doing as little as possible to help heal correctly. Sensitivity is still coming back, random nerve pain from clitoris can be really rough at times.

<em>
Proper
</em>
post-op granulation treatment often requires the tissue to be excised
<em>
before
</em>
the silver nitrate is applied. Unless you&#39;re able to trim off the excess granulation tissue first with a scalpel or medical scissors, it&#39;s probably not going to work as well as you hope it will.
</p>
<p>
Most any gynacologist should be able to treat it for you. I would suggest seeing if there&#39;s a trans friendly one in your area that can help you out.

Great! Considering McGinn is one of the most respected GRS surgeons in the US, I&#39;m pretty sure someone at her clinic would be able to help you out.
