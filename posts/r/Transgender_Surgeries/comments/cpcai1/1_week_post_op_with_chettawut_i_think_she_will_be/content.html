1 week post op with Chettawut. I think she will be Beautiful when she is fully healed and she is already very sensitive inside and out I could hardly stay still when the nurses were cleaning and removing the bandages. So far no complaints I highly recommend Chettawut he is very nice.

Piece of advice though, try and keep your legs closed as much as possible during early recover. The stitching around the entrance to the vaginal canal is very sensitive and if loosened, can gape a little and create slightly enlarged scarring.

Glad youâ€™ve had a positive experience. I had my surgery with him two years ago and my results have settled down very well. If you need any advice, or just someone to talk to whilst youâ€™re out there- reach out. It looks like youâ€™re going to have some really good definition between inner and out labias.

Thank you. I only have two questions the first one is how long did you have to sleep on your back for after surgery and the second one is when did your vagina take itâ€™s final shape? Thanks ðŸ˜Š

Longer than I hoped for and yet shorter than I expected. It takes a while to adapt to it, however, eventually you figure out a way to make yourself comfortable whilst on your back. What hotel are you staying at? The Dusit have a selection of pillows, all of which serve different purposes.

I honestly would say it took a good 12 months or so. It wasnâ€™t really until I started having regular sex that I felt like I really had a vagina and then I started seeing how it was softening up and changing.
</p>
<p>
Hope that helps.

I&#39;m seeing him next month and just can&#39;t wait but also having quite the pre-surgical anxiety (I&#39;m over 50yo, never had surgery and HSP). There are so many posts about Dr Chettawut&#39;s wonderful results from the past years, but your positive post means so much to me right now and more than you could know. Thank you. And all our best wishes for continued positive results!

I just made my inquiry to their team. How was your general process with getting things rolling? Costs outside of the surgery itself (hotel etc). Curious to hear more about those.
