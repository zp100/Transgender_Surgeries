You look pretty. That sounds crazy. Was there minimal dissection? Were the sounds disturbing or could you just block it all out?

The doctor was reducing the hump on the bridge of my nose. I had rhinoplasty 10 months ago as part of FFS, and once all the swelling went away there was still a minor hump. He offered to revise it for me in-office.
</p>
<p>
They injected anesthesia into my nose and then for the procedure put a sheet of medical paper over my face with a hole for my nose, so I couldn‚Äôt see (not that I wanted to).
</p>
<p>
I will not forget the sound of scraping bone and cartilage. So surreal.

Jesus. For that reason alone we never mess around with local procedures at my job. I&#39;m not saying they did something wrong, just the sounds of surgery can be really traumatizing. I tried doing a dental implant under local and can still remember every moment as though it was this morning instead of 2yrs ago! Good luck and happy healing.

I did feel a little traumatized afterwards. I think my body had a nervous reaction mid-way through the procedure. My clothes were drenched in sweat, I didn‚Äôt even realize until after. It definitely took some time to calm down, but the nurses were really kind and helped get me a cool compress and water and some food.

The same exact thing happened to me. The dental surgeon was like &#34;Uh are you OK, man?&#34; I was like &#34;Clearly, no.&#34; They gave me nitrous and I was able to finish the procedure, but I was like &#34;Why now? I needed this 2hrs ago.&#34; They told me they don&#39;t offer it unless ppl ask bc you have to pay out of pocket. It was like $100. Worth every penny to not experience those sounds...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad you made it though!

2 hours!! üò≠ I couldn‚Äôt imagine. That‚Äôs awful. Thankfully my procedure was only about 20 minutes. Aside from the minor freakout, everything went smoothly. But woof, yeah, it‚Äôs been a day.

It&#39;s known as &#34;laughing gas&#34;. Just makes you out of it so you don&#39;t have awareness of what&#39;s happening.

It sort of felt like a numb rubbing, but it sounded like someone filing metal on a rock.
</p>
<p>
I was fine at the start, but my body freaked out a bit halfway. I got really warm and sweaty and my arms and hands got pinpricks like they were asleep. I had to breathe slow and calm myself down. I actually spent more time resting after the procedure and regaining my composure than I did in the procedure itself, which was only about 20 minutes.

It‚Äôs weird being conscious for surgery, had my testicles removed and I was awake for the whole thing , I could feel him cutting and stitching but there was no pain still was very difficult to get through but worth it

I think being awake for any kind of surgery requires a good deal of fortitude , and tbh I feel  the trans community goes through this a great deal to get by in the current world we live in , we grow up learning to be strong in order to become happy with the lives we want

I had that same operation too, I was 13, when it happened.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had 3 operations since then and I need another one because I have a deviated septum in my right nostril.
</p>
<p>
Rest well and I know you will have a great recovery process too.

This is my 3rd nasal surgery, too üòÖ Had sinusitis surgery to correct a chronic infection I‚Äôd had for years and fix a deviated septum, then rhinoplasty for FFS, then the revision today.

Compared to most other mammals, humans have evolved really terrible noses and sinuses.

Aww I am so sorry that you are going through so much pain and suffering, as well as lots of Discomfort too.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re My Superhero.
</p>
<p>
I am going to see an ENT, in February of 2023, I hope he&#39;ll operate on my nose, because the other 3 ENT Doctor&#39;s didn&#39;t want to help me by doing this option on my nose.
</p>
<p>
I relate a lot to Rudolph the red nosed Reindeer animated movie when I was a kid growing up in the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s, and 80&#39;s.
</p>
<p>
That movie is my favorite movie of all time because my nose was disfigured just like poor Rudolph&#39;s nose was, and he was an outcast and a misfit in society then, and so was I too.
</p>
<p>
I have surgeries coming up in 2023, I am meeting with my Dr next week Monday afternoon to fill out the 21 page referral forms in order to have him fax over those referrals to Trans Care in Vancouver, BC., So that I can be back dated for the long wait that I have already waited for all because my Dr wasn&#39;t versed at all with SRS/GRS surgeries both Top and Bottom surgeries I mean.
</p>
<p>
So 3 years later here I am.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re my inspiration because you haven&#39;t given up on yourself, and neither have I.
</p>
<p>
What doesn&#39;t kill us makes us stronger.
</p>
<p>
I agree with that statement.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to chat with me if you&#39;d like to?
</p>
<p>
I am going to follow your Reddit profile page, if you&#39;d like to you can follow mine as well?
</p>
<p>
We will both get to our destination in our different journey&#39;s hunny.
</p>
<p>
As William Shakespeare said:
</p>
<p>
This above all,

I had the same thing a few months ago!! I didn‚Äôt even realize that was a possibility until pretty much when they shoved the scissors under my skin lol It‚Äôs such a unique experience. I told him that I had sort of always wondered what it felt like and now I know. I posted an AMA on
<a href="/r/cosmeticsurgery" rel="nofollow">r/cosmeticsurgery</a>
not realizing that was against the rules so it was taken down ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I hope your recovery goes well!! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about recovery btw!

Ah! Yeah I was really surprised when he recommended doing the revision ‚Äúin office‚Äù. I was like, uh,, what?? Glad it all worked out!
</p>
<p>
How long did it take for any swelling and bruising to go down?

My doctor knew I have a really high pain tolerance and threshold for handling medical stuff, so he felt very confident I could handle it. I just wish they had numbed me more because I felt a lot of pain during the whole thing. But thankfully it still went well and we just chatted the whole time.
</p>
<p>
The swelling and bruising subsided much more quickly than it did for the initial surgery. But I would say it took about a week for the bruising and at least a good month for the swelling to settle.

This was a really interesting AMA thanks for doing it! I really learned some stuff, like that I&#39;m going to have to think REALLY hard before agreeing to do the same thing üòÅ

If I‚Äôd thought about it, I would‚Äôve asked the doctor if I could take a Klonopin or other anti-anxiety med beforehand. I also would‚Äôve eaten a bigger breakfast, and probably skipped the coffee.

<p>
I feel fine this morning!

I had the same thing done about a year ago. It was brutal. I experienced the same shock reaction too. Hope it heals well!!!

Healing was nothing bad, I had to wear the nose bandages for a week or two but was fine otherwise. I think the only problem with a return to work would be if you feel self-conscious about the bandages.
