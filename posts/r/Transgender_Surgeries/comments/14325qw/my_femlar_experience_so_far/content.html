Sunday, June 4th.
</p>
<p>
Obviously it&#39;s still really early.
</p>
<p>
Bur I will update this as I go along. I arrived at PDX in Portland on the afternoon of Sunday June 4th. I had not planned on renting a car for this week, but instead using Uber.
</p>
<p>
Well mid day on a Sunday Uber was a minimum of $68.00 usd. Doing some quick math and realizing that is equivalent to a full tank of fuel for my four door Jeep Wrangler I opted out. I asked one of the airport help people if there was a restaurant or lounge I could sit in and wait for high time to go down. Now I realize, but the time I order a meal and fries, I&#39;d have probably made up the difference in cost anyway, but for me it was a matter of principal. They airport man suggested the train, which is $1.25 for half a day or $2.50 for a full day. I took the train as it was scenic.
</p>
<p>
After a 45 minute journey, I arrived at my hotel, Hotel Roae by Stay Pineapple. It&#39;s pretty cute and everything has a pineapple theme. üçç They allow dogs if you have a furry companion to join you. My room wasn&#39;t ready immediately so they held my bags and I went exploring. I went to the Portland City Rose Festival across the street. It was $15.00, entry with re-entry allowed. Lots of carnival food so instead I went to Paddy&#39;s Pub for nachos, they weren&#39;t great and the service was soso. Honestly I think I&#39;d have enjoyed the carnival food more.
</p>
<p>
Later on I went for a walk and took some photos. Went to the Target and bought myself some yogurt, milk for tea, and drinks. I had dinner at Hubers, the oldest Cafe in Portland, the service was wonderful, the waiter was friendly and made brilliant recommendations. I had an American Style Thanks Giving Dinner, not what I am used to, but so yummy! Also bread with butter, a coffee and brownie fot dessert. Now I don&#39;t know about Texas, but based on this brownie, they&#39;re much bigger in Portland!
</p>
<p>
Monday, June 5th.
</p>
<p>
The next day, Monday June 5th, I had my 09:00am pre op with Dr Thomas. I finally met Estelle and Jonica, now I&#39;ve seen them both and can pick up on the differences in their voice, I know who is who! Dr Thomas was really nice. I can see how some people might not click with him, but I totally did. I think it&#39;s because he is a very analytical and scientific person. I appreciated his honestly and bluntness. I definitely feel he was the right choice. The office is so cute and has plants so felt right at home. These clinical, white marble floors lab places make me feel like I&#39;m in a Resident Evil film.. Not the games but the films. (&#34;She&#39;s mutating, I want her in the Nemesis Program.&#34;) Sorry I&#39;m a nerd.
</p>
<p>
So, following pre op I had breakfast, then went to my hotel to wash my hair and do my make up. I then went exploring I met loads of people I chatted to, I love how friendly people are here.
</p>
<p>
By 7:00 my friend and care giver while surgery is happening arrived. We put his bag in the hotel and then got dinner. Buffalo Wild Wings, because it shut down where we live. The service was.. not great. After that we went to the hotel, cleaned up and slept.
</p>
<p>
Tusaday, June 6th.
</p>
<p>
Then today, Tusaday June 6th we Uber to the Wilshire Surgery Centre, it felt like it was over in a jiffy, now I just cannot talk for two weeks. After getting back to the hotel, basically did lots of sleeping, ate an entire pot of yogurt and some popsicles. Took my meds, not much to report.
</p>
<p>
Wednesday, June 7th.
</p>
<p>
Went for 24 hour check up, everything looked good. Friend and I had some brunch, I ate small on account of a sore throat. Got back to hotel, got tidied up, had a shower, but didn&#39;t wash hair or scar. Did some make up and went exploring. We ended up at the rose Gardens and Ramen for dinner. More to come soon!
</p>
<p>
Monday, June 11th.
</p>
<p>
Haven&#39;t really filled in the other days. I might, depending on my mood later. I&#39;m Just overwhelmed with doubt.
</p>
<p>
I want to be CLEAR, I truly believe Dr Thomas is a scientist, artist and master of his craft. There are many examples on here of people who prove that. He has a video on YouTube with dozens of beautiful female voices. All the naysayers can go to hell.

I had femlar with Dr Thomas and had no laser adjustments done. Nor have I done speech therapy like he recommended.
</p>
<p>
I pass on the phone and in person. I had FFS before VFS and people would call me miss then change to sir after they heard me speak.
</p>
<p>
I think the only thing I struggled with was vocal fatigue for a few months. This was minor and mostly just slight hoarseness in the morning. The big thing for me was the week after surgery I coughed a lot. I would recommend buying over the counter cough syrup.
</p>
<p>
I did lose volume, but it seems to only be a big deal at loud places like a concert. But generally you can&#39;t hear people at places like that anyway.

Sheesh, sounds like I need to look into the local public transit (looks like Trimet) when I go to and from pdx next month, that‚Äôs an expensive Uber.
</p>
<p>
Also going to be staying at the Pineapple when I go to Dr. Thomas next month.
</p>
<p>
Hope you‚Äôre doing well.

Yeah I plan on removing my polish before I fly over to pdx, I always do before going under anesthesia given they usually put an oximeter in your fingers (surprised they didn‚Äôt ask you to remove the acrylics before you got to Wilshire, given they did for me for GRS and FFS).
</p>
<p>
Btw just wanted to let you know considering your last paragraph in this post, you‚Äôre gorgeous, and you present yourself as femme much better than I do (looking at your post history).
</p>
<p>
Trust the surgery, it will work.  It‚Äôs the most effective procedure available for VFS imho, considering it affects far more of your vocal anatomy than a CTA or a glottoplasty, and Dr. Thomas offers the laser follow ups just in case there‚Äôs an issue anyway.
</p>
<p>
Wishing you a swift recovery, sounds like you‚Äôre already quite out and about, so that‚Äôs mainly re: your voice recovery I guess :).  I wanna hear it (your voice) when you‚Äôre ready.
