I&#39;m 3-months post-SRS at Nuffield Health Brighton (UK). The surgeon recommended a conventional vaginoplasty utilising penile tissue (rather than peno-scrotal). I&#39;d been on blockers since early puberty, and I came out with just over 4 inches of vaginal depth - admittedly a good result for what I had to offer. Aesthetically, I&#39;m thrilled - I imagine most of the scrotal tissue went into creating my labia minora / clitoral hood etc.  I&#39;ve managed to push my depth out to about 4 1/2 inches through dilation - but if anyone has any tips to maximise depth (pressure, angles, recommended dilators etc.) I&#39;d be thrilled!

Some people additionally dilate with estrogen cream from time to time to help soften the tissue.
</p>
<p>
And some people use organic coconut oil. It has small molecules and may penetrate deep into the tissue, and may also make for a softening effect. Using non latex condoms is necessary if condoms are used because oil can dissolve latex.
</p>
<p>
And I have heard of some people who tried to integrate a few things from Suporns dynamic dilation. Doing it careful may be recommendable.
</p>
<p>
Someone else I heard of mainly applied some pressure for a while. Doing this careful may be recommendable too.

Dynamic dialtion uses stirring motions.

I’d guess that at 3 months it’s probably too later to do anything, although you may as well try.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind saying who your surgeon was.

just work at the maximal pain level, constantly.
</p>
<p>
take strong pain killers if needed
</p>
<p>
you can gain some depth in the early months as you&#39;re discovered, but if you can reach 5 that may be the maximum. going beyond 25% gain may be risky.
</p>
<p>
as soon as you stop trying to gain depth, the window of possibility will close

Thanks - I&#39;ve perhaps been comparitively gentle with dilation so far. Plenty of pressure, but not too much. I&#39;ve been mindful of granulation tissue, not to mention perforating my vagina. I weaned myself off painkillers in the first week I was home - the last thing I need is a codeine (or even paracetemol) addiction. Now I&#39;m healed up I might increase pressure a tad.
