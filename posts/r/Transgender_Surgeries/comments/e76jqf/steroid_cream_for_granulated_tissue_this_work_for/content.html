My PCP prescribed regimen of 2x daily application of Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP, 0.1% to granulated tissue just inside my vag.   She was hesitant to use silver nitrate for fear of potential nerve damage near the skin surface.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone tried this or other steriod creams and how

I’d just get silver nitrate sticks from your surgeon. I had such bad hypergranulation it completely covered and came out of my vaginal entrance. I was instructed to treat with silver nitrate the tissue once a week for four weeks. It’s completely gone now.

I had one spot of hypegranulation, right inside my vaginal opening. My surgeon excised and treated it with silver nitrate, and it caused zero problems. Silver nitrate treatment  is

super
</em>
common with post-op women, and I think your provider is a little paranoid. But trying the cream won&#39;t hurt, so just apply it twice daily as prescribed (I&#39;d do it just after you dilate in the morning and night.)

I know. That&#39;s why said she was being a little paranoid -- silver nitrate is generally the go-to treatment for post-op hypergranulation, and it usually doesn&#39;t cause any issues like that. It&#39;s a much faster treatment than steroid cream.
