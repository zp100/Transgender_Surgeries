I had surgery in two parts with Prof. Dr. HeÃŸ in Germany in August 2023 and February 2024. Depth is about 13-14cm (bit over 5 inch) and I can comfortably fit a 30mm dilator (Vagiwell No.5) with a bit of lube and a few minutes time. Smaller dilators like the Vagiwell No.4 go in very easy. Self lubrication works wonderfully when I&#39;m aroused and orgasms are great.Â Overall I&#39;m very happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
I had some complications 11 days after the first surgery while I was still in the hospital, I was starting to bleed seemingly out of nowhere, which had to be sewn under GA and extended my stay for another 4 days. The hospital staff was very nice to me even though they were chronically understaffed.
</p>
<p>
Thought about posting for a while since I saw so few photos of Vaginoplasties done by HeÃŸ on this subreddit and finally came around to doing it. Good luck to all my sisters fighting or waiting for their turn, don&#39;t give up, it was absolutely worth it for me! ðŸ’—

Wow that&#39;s a really good result. She looks very natural and your scarring is minimal,once healed up further you probably won&#39;t even be able to see them unless you&#39;re looking closely. I hope that you&#39;re feeling more comfortable in your body now :)
</p>
<p>
P.S. As a Trans guy I&#39;m constantly astonished and amazed by the results you ladies share on here :D. Thank you to all of your for your bravery showing your results and sharing about your complications and revisions needed. It really helps those of us awaiting surgery(by giving us hope that things do in fact get better :) x

It looks great when closed, but why is the clitoris so big?

Iâ€™m guessing because not all clitoris are the same size, the same way not all of us ladyâ€™s are build, same size or are perfect but that what makes every one special and unique on this subreddit and in life.

Rule 1. Be respectful to others, including identity and choices in surgery. Be polite and engage in civil discourse.

I recently had surgery with Dr HeÃŸ (08/10/24) and my results are very similar. Absolutely fantastic surgery!

First of all congratulations girl! Looks amazing! What is the urethral lining? Is it something to ensure a more functional stream when peeing? I might be very interested as urination has always been one of my main concerns and Iâ€™d love to use the toilet like any genetic woman.

Thank you! The urethral lining is used for self-lubrication inside of the vaginal canal. The part of the urethra that was previously part of the penis is left on and folded into the vaginal canal. There&#39;s a (very simplified) video-animation of the process
