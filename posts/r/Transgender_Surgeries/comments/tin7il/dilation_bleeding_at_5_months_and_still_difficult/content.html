Hi, all was fine in the 4th month, 2x day schedule...
</p>
<p>
3 dilators full depth but the 1st (25mm) takes me from 15 to 30 mins to get full depth. The 2nd (35mm) is easy 5-10 mins, the 3rd (40mm) from 5-10 mins. Sometimes i go to the 1st at the end for 5 mins more, but the session ends being 1 hour and a half, so I mostly end at 120 min. After that, Dilating time is 10-10-20 generally, but you know inserting times doesn&#39;t counts as dilating (making longer session). And started bleeding from the end of the canal. Dilators come out with blood in the tip, so I assume is in the end. I pull the lub out with index finger then, because the panty liners get too wet with lube &amp; blood &amp; discharge and it&#39;s a mess all day. But I&#39;m seeing bleeding more than other days. When doing poop, the pressure makes bleed a little sometimes. Sometimes nothing.
</p>
<p>
Surgeon told me it&#39;s habitual but this gotta be controlled. So, I&#39;m bleeding every session a little bit, and then 2 days a week it&#39;s a little more than usual.
</p>
<p>
Started to take muscle relaxant before the session, because I have too much tension in the pelvis, back, neck, stomach,  and can&#39;t relax consciously. I&#39;m really struggling with relaxation. Also taking little benzodiazepine helps with relaxation.
</p>
<p>
Obligued to use 3 dilators, just the 1st takes me longer to insert now, I&#39;m confused, and the bleeding adds more anxiety.
</p>
<p>
Also found hair in the canal at 5 cm deep, together with some strange protuberances... Could it be skin detaching at 5 months? Could it be granulation? It feels like veins, or little bumps. Never noticed before.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not good economically and not eating like before, my activities g sleeping are affected and have heavy worries about how I&#39;m gonna pass the winter. Cold makes my body be too tense. Some tips for relaxing than all we know? Another surgeon told me &#34;it&#39;s all up to you&#34; but i can&#39;t relax with known breathing techniques, calm music, etc.

Have you tried vibrating dilators? They are not expensive and they helped me with this issue. A LOT! My surgeon also prescribed me Estradiol Vaginal Cream. Now use that no more lube for me.

Yes I have one cheap, 20 mm diameter, but it5 helped when my problem was width, not depth.
</p>
<p>
There is some corrosion in the internal parts (cheap AF) so I left it aside...
</p>
<p>
Maybe it&#39;s time to use it again, I remember it was nice to have it inside, but I was so tight there that couldn&#39;t reach the last cms. I&#39;m sure my problem is relaxation, not lube or different dilators, but can&#39;t find the right technique to relax...
</p>
<p>
Also have a a little of promestriene (tiny bottle), it makes the skin really soft.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for reply, will try when I can the vibrator.
