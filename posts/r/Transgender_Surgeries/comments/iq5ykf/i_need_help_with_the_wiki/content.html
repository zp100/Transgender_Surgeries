<p>
For some time now I&#39;ve not been able to keep up with it all the content I want to add top the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index">wiki
</a>
, and at the same time I&#39;d like to expand its scope help more people. I&#39;m the only person working on it and unfortunately I&#39;ve reached my limit. There&#39;s also the risk that I&#39;ll stop one day and there will be no one in place to continue.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a noticeable increase in the number of FTM people using the sub, and I think its time to add more support for them. I&#39;d like to add FTM surgeries to the wiki in the same way that MTF currently is. It&#39;s a lot of work and I simply cannot do it. If one or more people would like to tackle it then I&#39;d like to discuss how it might be done.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also unable to keep up with surgery video&#39;s on YouTube. Its too time consuming and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing many.
</p>
<p>
If anyone has any special interests that might help others I could setup new pages for them. There are a few people who maintain such content already, however it would be an advantage to have it centralized - the wiki is the start of something that could be so much more in a years to come.
</p>
<p>
An example might be the &#34;Am I trans posts&#34;. It&#39;s an important topic and there&#39;s been so many posts on other subs and some great responses.
</p>
<p>
Another is the question of research supporting gender identity. A page on that would very helpful.
</p>
<p>
My main philosophy in the building the wiki is to help people find what they need elsewhere. In some cases its helpful to give an overview, and I have occasionally
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/implant-technology">written on certain subjects
</a>
, but I try to avoid it.
</p>
<p>
If anyone would like to contribute in any way, even if its small, I&#39;d like to talk about it. You could be helping a lot of people.
</p>

<em>
Edit:
</em>
</p>
<p>
To explain in more detail.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This
<em>
is not
</em>
about moderating this sub. That&#39;s not a problem at the moment, and the wiki is actually on two other subs setup where no one can post.
</li>
<li>
This
<em>
is
</em>
about collecting information from all anywhere public on internet and adding links in the wiki so people can find it. There&#39;s so much being posted these days, and I&#39;ve so little time, that I&#39;m not able to keep up anymore.
</li>
<li>
Its not really about structuring the wiki either. The main problem is just collecting information, organizing it is relatively easy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My workflow at the moment is to edit the wiki on my computer and then just copy the complete pages over to reddit. This makes it easy to do, but hard to work with others. Unless I&#39;m getting a huge amount of help from others I don&#39;t want to change as it will slow me down. This would not be a problem if someone wanted to work on a topic that I&#39;m not, FTM wiki pages for example.
</p>
<p>
I try not to write my opinion on things as I find its almost impossible to write something authoritative and correct, and its also too much time to write and keep up to date. The wiki&#39;s I&#39;ve seen on other subs don&#39;t get updated properly when this happens because people are very reluctant to modify others work. Lists of links don&#39;t suffer that problem. The cases where I have written my own content are exceptions that perhaps I shouldn&#39;t do, but I was particularly interested in something and it was a handy place to put it.
</p>
<p>
In case anyone wants to be a mod here, there&#39;s no real need because the only parts that mods do with any regularity is reviewing reports, banning trolls, and making sure people follow the rules (there&#39;s not much of that). The other mod tasks are quite infrequent. Anyone can help people out with advice.
</p>
<p>
And since we&#39;re on the subject of this sub,
<a href="https://subredditstats.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries">its growing quite rapidly
</a>
and I expect it will continue to do so. This sub has already helped a lot of people and by contributing you&#39;d be helping even more in the future.

Can we talk in a couple of days? I&#39;ll be off for the next 3 weeks (BA on tuesday), and if you&#39;re needing help you&#39;re going to have to hold my hand the first time lol. I don&#39;t entirely know what you&#39;re asking (or if I have the necessary skills) but if there&#39;s anything I can do to help you out I&#39;ll try.

This may be a super weird suggestion but since the wiki is written in Markdown I assume, or even if it is in HTML that&#39;s fine, could you make a Git page and then people who wanted to help could suggest improvements and then all you&#39;d have to do is approve permanent changes to the Git version of the wiki and then copy and paste over the Markdown/html to reddit? It would take some of the work off your plate while allowing people who may want to contribute some stuff but not be a full contributor the option to suggest changes.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough people who know how to do that to make it useful. The main problem is finding anyone who&#39;s prepared to spend any time at all on it - the rest is details.

Im new to reddit and i dont understand the mechanics of it yet. That said, im in the process of understanding my own transition and spending a lot of time reading about FTM surgery and health professionals in Australia. I could help with research i reckon, just not formatting at this stage?

There&#39;s an ftm page in the works if you&#39;re interested in helping with that. I might need to set up a reddit chat group if people are working on the same thing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/ftm/introduction" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/ftm/introduction
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most time consuming thing is searching through posts and finding those that can help people. I filter out those that don&#39;t really add anything useful. For example, I pick a surgeon and find everything I can on them and add them to the wiki.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s an Australian MTF surgery page for example
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/australia" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/australia
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But there&#39;s not much in it compared to the USA page
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/usa
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The formatting is just making it look nice and its dead easy with a bit of practice. There&#39;s guides on how to do that and I&#39;ll you&#39;d have to do is follow whats already done. There&#39;s a bit of formatting here with the bullet points.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a couple of guides
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown
</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/faq/formatting_guide" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/faq/formatting_guide
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You&#39;d probably need to do it on a computer. It would be incredibly painful on a phone.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a set of wiki pages on Australia doctors prescribing HRT. Here&#39;s one.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/australia" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/australia
</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Its probably somewhat biased to MTF.

I would like to add some information to the wiki regarding SRS surgery for MTF in Zurich Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Fakin no longer works at University Hospital of Zurich. He now works at
<a href="https://www.oceanclinic.net/" rel="nofollow">OceanClinic
</a>
in Zurich Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Richard Fakin only does inversion Vaginoplasty and he got fired from USZ (University Hospital of Zurich).
</p>
<p>
There is a diffrent surgeon at USZ who does SRS now. His name is Dr. med. Matthias Waldner and he offers inversion vaginoplasty and sigmoid colon vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Waldner assisted Dr. Fakin every time they did SRS surgeries at USZ. He has just as much experience as Dr. Fakin.
</p>
<p>
Just put
<a href="http://www.plastische-chirurgie.usz.ch/ueber-die-klinik/Seiten/team.aspx" rel="nofollow">this
</a>
in your browser and look for his name.
</p>
<p>
Yeah thats it basically. Dr. Fakin has had quite alot of bad reviews and I‘ve heard some horror stories of his work but Dr. Waldner hasn‘t had any complaints which is a good sign.
</p>
<p>
Anyway just thought I‘d add this.
</p>
<p>
Have a great day!

Thanks, I updated the wiki. I moved him from Switzerland to Spain properly and linked to this comment.
</p>
<p>
Do you have links for the negative reviews?
</p>
<p>
Do you have any links saying he was fired?

Just to be clear he works in Zurich Switzerland, Marbella Spain and Madrid Spain at OceanClinic locations as far as I know.
</p>
<p>
Only thing on the internet I could find was
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i5jr7x/just_got_approval_for_surgery_with_dr_richard/g0qgmsg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3" rel="nofollow">this
</a>
review on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Transgender surgery is still very much a taboo here in my country so the patients aren‘t really vocal on the internet about it for some reason. Also he worked at a very big hospital and didnt have his own treatment review tab or something like that so it is extra hard to leave a review specifically on him. Everything else I know is from a private connection who used to operate with him and through other trans women I have met who have gone to him.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps.

I can&#39;t afford the time to review the existing links without compromising something else so its better to just leave it at the moment. It can be quite time consuming to check them when parts of the post are missing - the remainder might be useful, or not. And its often possible to find the missing parts with a bit of effort.

If you’re willing and they are, some of the folks on the phallo subreddit can probably help out. There’s a lot of knowledgeable people there.
</p>
<p>
I’m willing to help, but I’m still pre-surgery and in the research phase, so I can’t attest to personal testimony; however, it’s a sort of special interest of mine. I can also help on the Canadian side, as most active people in the sub (and transmasc people who have had bottom surgery on Reddit, it seems) are American or British. I have some opinions on GCS Montreal and their approach to transmasc surgeries...
</p>
<p>
Oh, also, I know basic HTML/CSS. Maybe a bit beyond basic. So in terms of knowing the tech for a wiki, I’m confident I can do that.

That would be helpful.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s not really any particular knowledge needed, apart from being able to find things. Its mainly just reviewing external content to see if its worth adding, then linking to it. I mentioned elsewhere he that I&#39;d prefer to avoid creating other kinds of content in the wiki as it is very likely to cause problems.
</p>
<p>
For example, pick a surgeon, find out everything you can about them, add the worthwhile links to the wiki. If anything new appears about that surgeon later then add that too.
</p>
<p>
If you have anything personal to add then post it somewhere else and link to it.
</p>
<p>
The wiki tech is very easy. Unfortunately reddit doesn&#39;t provide many options to play with.

Due to privacy reasons I&#39;m not keen on using Discord, but its also not solving a real need at the moment. There is a chat feature in reddit. Its not great but it works for a small amount of communication.
</p>
<p>
What are you interested in working on?

Hey
<a href="/u/HiddenStill" rel="nofollow">u/HiddenStill
</a>
. I would be happy to help with the ftm side of the wiki, if you’re still looking for help. I’m ftm and I’ve had both top and bottom surgery. I’ve been pretty active in lower surgery spaces for trans masculine people for a few years now and I help mod a lower surgery discord for trans mascs to help provide information and support to those going through the process. I like to dig thru info and categorize it. A while back I organized transbucket masterslists for meta and phallo which is an organized list of every meta and phallo post on transbucket.

Heey!!
</p>
<p>
The wiki you begun has inspired and helped me!
</p>
<p>
I understand the need for a broader, larger scope and assistance in this endevear.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t how exactly how I can help but I would love to! I know that I am passionate and inspire other people! I am great at networking a recruting!
</p>
<p>
I am super busy with school and work but 2-4 years I will be way more profiecent in math and programming as well as eventually AI. So don&#39;t have oodles of time, but would be interested in helping!
</p>
<p>
Something about your post speaks to me, who knows? Perhaps this will blossom?

The main requirement is just being organized and keeping at it. A small amount regularly adds up over time, and its quite a value skill you can apply to other things.

Done.
</p>
<p>
As you have made a lot of posts I&#39;d suggest you add back and forward links to all of them, and possibly make an index as well.

Hormones is a difficult topic because of the amount of information available, and in particular Transfeminine Science.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://transfemscience.org/" rel="nofollow">https://transfemscience.org/
</a>
</p>
<p>
However, that site is hard to understand for most people.
</p>
<p>
I think it would be very useful if there was a resource that explained how doctors actually did HRT, with references to external sources. e.g. a part would be what blood tests are done, what the results mean, how you prescribe given those results, the expected results, and so on. Document the side effects and problems, how they are diagnosed and what the usual treatment is.
</p>
<p>
Further, there are many HRT protocols in use, and it would discuss how each of them they are done.
</p>
<p>
It would be useful for people to understand what their doctors are doing, to evaluate if their doctors are competent, and to help those who DIY to avoid harming themselves.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think any of the people who I know of who have the knowledge to do this are capable of actually writing something lay people can understand. I think it would be quite a lot of work over time if done properly, and med students are not known for having much time. I&#39;d imagine it would be quite satisfying though. Is that something you can do?

I can give you access to a page in the wiki, and I&#39;d suggest you just start writing in it. Don&#39;t try to do it all in one piece or it will never happen.

<p>
You should be able to edit this.
