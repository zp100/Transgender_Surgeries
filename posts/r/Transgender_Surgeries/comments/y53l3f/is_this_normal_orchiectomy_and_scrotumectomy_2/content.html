So first you have LOTS of swelling.  Make sure to bed rest for the next few days.  Too much movement can cause hematoma (pooling of blood in what is left of your scrotal area).
</p>
<p>
Otherwise as RSM mentioned you could have numbness down there for quiet a while anywhere from a few months to a year.  I have some weird semi-numbness from my simple Orchi.
</p>
<p>
But again the big thing is to keep an eye on the swelling and rest.  I would take Ibuprofen each day to help with the swelling and ice down there for 10-20mins two to three times a day.

You can absolutely get up and move around.  Just keep it slow.  Its just good if 90% of the time you are sitting or laying down for a few days.  And I would definitely do that given the swelling you still have.

Thereâ€˜s ice packs that are on time use and work by mixing a salt with water to get cool.
</p>
<p>
Itâ€˜s just plastic back like regular ice packs with crumbly stuff in there and a bubble you burst.
</p>
<p>
Those should be available in pharmacies and drug stores. Might want to call around for them.

Or just have frozen peas delivered to you daily as the last resort.
</p>
<p>
However depending on where you are the cold tap water might already be cool enough to work as a somewhat substitute.

yea looks fine after it stops swelling it should be straight mine was super swollen too and I had bruising all the way from my taint to my asshole for months.   just take care of the stitches and you will be fine.
</p>
<p>
I did mine over 4 years ago I even got to hold my severed testicles that were sitting on the medical pan after they were removed they were cold and squishy that was an interesting experience lol.. whole thing took like an hour or so I have 0 regrets to this day :)

no clue I did not have that issue but you had much much more damage done than I did.   the scrotal removal would of required me to goto the hospital when I did mine so it must be more work / dangerous..  I did just the orchi in just the doctors office i was awake the entire time but I couldn&#39;t feel a thing except for some occassional pushing and pulling it was weird lol

If you don&#39;t have anti-constipation medicine you should get some.  Otherwise if you have any fruit (canned is fine), applesauce, or ideally fruit juice like apple juice.  Those can all help

I donâ€™t see any signs of infection in the surgery area and Iâ€™m confident that itâ€™s going well for you. I wish you a speedy and full recovery.

ok the complete opposite, but when i had testicular implants i also had some absolutely NASTY bruising that looked pretty similar!! I&#39;d say to just keep an eye on it for any bad smell (worse than like..surgery smell. i know a lot of the time after surgeries things smell a bit funky), oozing, it being very warm to the touch, and excessive swelling.
</p>
<p>
are you taking any pain meds? some of them will help bring the swelling down!

Mine looked nothing like this. Iâ€™m guessing you had the sac removed also? Mine was very small cut and it didnâ€™t bother me at all. I had it done with my FFS
