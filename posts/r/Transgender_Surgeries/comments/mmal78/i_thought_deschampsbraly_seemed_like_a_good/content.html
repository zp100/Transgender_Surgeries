It seems like all surgeons are trying to push more stuff on the patients than the patients originally ask for, and it seems like surgeons are first and foremost a business, and not a medical care thing.  Its really scary and depressing.
</p>
<p>
edit: i want to directly ask him about that patient and their bad experience, but I don&#39;t want him to hate me.  See how difficult this sorta thing is?  I don&#39;t want to offend the guy that might be cutting my face open, and yet I want to know his side and everything.
</p>
<p>
even though I&#39;m MTF, this post felt like a rude awakening
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/ep86uv/im_the_first_ever_case_of_ftm_facial/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/ep86uv/im_the_first_ever_case_of_ftm_facial/</a>
i had been noticing how so many posts talk about how he suggests more things for his patients to get whether lip lifts or otherwise, and I&#39;m the type of person that doesn&#39;t want anything foreign added to my face (fillers/etc, even metal plates on the forehead scare me, yet they seem to be the only option. i&#39;ve only heard of one surgeon doing dissolvable screws for the forehead and i forget which one. and even that is scary).
</p>
<p>
why does it have to be this way :&#39;(
</p>
<p>
why can&#39;t there be any surgeons out there simply for the transgender healthcare, not as a capitalist enterprise, out there with no bad patient experiences and no bad results. Those that don&#39;t spend money advertising their image, and only publicizing the best results.  Human bias and all.  Is that really too much to ask?
</p>
<p>
edit: if you&#39;re downvoting me how are you not just shilling for surgeons?  Here&#39;s a result from keojampa despite previously hearing they deliver consistently excellent results.  I&#39;m SORRY for having GENUINE anxieties about these things (yes i get scared after seeing 1 bad experience/result), downvoting me for that is rude as heck.  I&#39;m not trying to slander them, I&#39;m concerned for my own stupid face, my bad.

All I can say is, there is always a chance of a bad result, no one is perfect. I can say from my experience, DB has personally talked me out of a lip lift multiple times because he feels it&#39;s too much for me. If he wanted money he could have just said yes too it the times I brought it up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I&#39;ve had a number of procedures from several surgeons. Never have they suggested additional procedures. If I ask for advice, they will give it, but always remind me that it is all about what I want and need. I would suggest having a few consultations and finding a surgeon you are comfortable with.

From some of the reviews, good reviews I might add, it seems like Deschamps frequently suggests additional procedures for facial harmony and such.
</p>
<p>
I agree, I&#39;m just anxious that I&#39;ll never be comfortable and that I should give up on trying, even though my face makes me so dysphoric.

Maybe they are not the right surgeon for you. They all have different approaches. Some are more focused on getting you to do what they think you need, some are trying to maximize the fees and others are focused on your happiness. I try to find the ones focused on my happiness. As an example, when I was in my consult, I was on the fence about my jaw and chin. I asked my surgeon his opinion and he said he did not think I need anything done to it. Based on his recommendation, I skipped the jaw and chin procedures and I am very happy with the results.

I had ffs with Dr. DB a few weeks ago, and I feel he did a really good job, beyond my expectations, although I&#39;m quite early in recovery and can&#39;t judge the final results yet. In particular I very much like what he did with my nose right now.
</p>
<p>
I did have a complication, basically due to my body being weird in a rare way and not liking 6-7 hours of immobility during the surgery. (Not my face, my face is recovering very well). Initially I was privately skeptical about whether he&#39;d done something wrong, but after learning more and hearing a lot of opinions from various sources it really was just my body being wacky and reacting badly in a rare way. In retrospect my body was always prone to this kind of issue, I just hadn&#39;t realized it was a health concern. Dr. DB and team promptly got me the care I needed and have been very concerned and compassionate and helpful about dealing with it. They&#39;re still asking about my recovery, which I find kind of sweet.

There&#39;s a ton of weird rare conditions out there. Mine was roughly 0.03% chance, and science hasn&#39;t yet discovered why the condition happens, just how to treat it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I guess I&#39;d say if you have unexplained chronic pain, numbness, swelling, stiffness, or tingling it may be worth following up with your doctor. But really, don&#39;t worry too much about it.

No, mine was not life threatening, and I&#39;m recovering decently. Any well staffed hospital would be able to figure out my condition and treat it. That said, there are other possible complications that are a lot more serious - I don&#39;t know all of them but surgeons prepare as best they can for all of the biggest risks. There is always risk associated with surgery. But we roll the dice every time we hop in the car too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I recently had FFS with Keojampa and compared to consultations with other surgeons I felt like he focused on what I truly needed and not a bunch of extras. For example I had one other surgeon recommend cheek implants, lower face lift and buccal fat removal in addition to everything else. Keojampa said it was too early to say if I truly needed the cheek implants and never mentioned the other two procedures. I genuinely felt like he had my best interest in mind and wasn‚Äôt just trying to get me to pay for as many procedures as possible.

No doctor is perfect. But your anxieties are completely valid and it only makes sense that you‚Äôre nervous around such a major surgery. All I can say is that Dr. DB never recommended to put anything foreign inside of me (e.g. silicone) besides the little titanium screws that go in your forehead which is very common for type-3 forehead reconstruction. And he actually did the opposite with me when it came to suggesting procedures I did not need that I personally brought up during our consult (e.g. trachea shave, lip lift) so I listened to his advice and I‚Äôm glad I took it.
</p>
<p>
I haven‚Äôt seen any negative posts where someone has been completely dissatisfied and regretful by going to Dr. DB for facial feminization surgery. But if you are going to him for facial masculinization surgery, I would definitely bring that post you found talking about him and try to clarify with him what happened in order for you to be more comfortable to have him as your surgeon.

I think DB is still a very good choice for FFS. He does have one f-m botched face surgery and a few with minor complications and one that claimed her ffs was botched by him. But overall he is consistent. What you should watch out for are serial butchers who are Russian Roulette surgeons, who are also sloppy and lack skills like Zukowski and Bart Van de Ven. These two have dead patients and a string of botched patients with Van de Ven reaching 30-40+ total and increasing number of botched women and 3-5 deaths or more. Lawsuits filed vs them and a plethora of bad reviews with horrific pics and articles about near death experiences of patients who luckilly evaded death by a millimeter. If you read about Diana Goetsch&#39;s coma article and Kellie Maloney&#39;s FFS in Belgium, both are very harrowing experiences of how they were both lucky to survive Van de Ven&#39;s surgery which almost nearly killed them and left them with mangled faces. Beware of cheap surgeons. Just don&#39;t bother.

I agree.  It&#39;s horrifying to consider death when undergoing surgery.  Absolutely so.   But the supposed mangled face from the FtM person that went to Deschamps is scary, too.
</p>
<p>
At some point its like, why isn&#39;t this sort of thing a socialized healthcare thing, IMO.

<p>
The FTM that your referred to in your post is a classic example of the &#34;truth&#34; never catching up to the initial post on the internet.
<br>
This patient and his results were discussed extensively in an earlier thread.  Someone actually found the original peer reviewed medical journal article that reports that patients surgery.   Keep in mind,  that patient had to give consent for the use of the pictures for publication in the medical journal.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1097/PRS.0000000000003185">https://sci-hub.se/10.1097/PRS.0000000000003185</a>
</p>
<p>
The subsequent details are bit foggy.  The patient apparently decided he needed more surgery on his chin, several years after the highly successful FTM surgery involving, among other procedures, a first ever creation of an Adam&#39;s Apple (caution - - one picture could trigger).  Also - - check out footnote 7 - - in the context of the description of the procedure to transfer cartilage from a rib in order to make an Adam&#39;s Apple.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the later surgery,  the patient apparently had a reaction to one of the drugs used during the 2nd surgery and that caused a cascade of problems.
</p>
<p>
But this is rather clearly not a result of the actions of the surgeon.  It is unique to this patient and the patient&#39;s unique reaction to the medication received during the surgery.
</p>
<p>
The problem you mention with Keojampa appears to be accurate.

Every reputable FFS surgeon will have bad reviews; it can be from any number of reasons. Surgeons have an incentive to push more procedures on you to earn more money; it&#39;s human nature. From what I&#39;ve seen overall, Dr. DB is among the top and busiest FFS surgeons in the field, so I think you are in good hands with him. Having said that, it&#39;s recommended you seek the opinion of some unbiased third parties regarding which FFS procedures you&#39;d truly benefit from.

i don&#39;t think it&#39;s really human nature tbh, most surgeons i&#39;ve met with tell me when they think i don&#39;t need something. they&#39;re not all money hungry, some actually care and do it because they wanna help people. that or they care about their rep and they know if they suggest to much that could end badly for them.

This review doesn&#39;t really deter me from wanting him to do my surgery.

I just had a consultation with Dr. Bassiri Gharb, one of the FFS surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic. Her recommendation was not to do anything related to FFS. She said anything that I would need would be age related and at least 5 years out.
</p>
<p>
Surgeons like this are not that uncommon and they are fantastic Doctors. These surgeons just aren&#39;t part of the small insular group of well-known Docs that thrive by name recognition and popularity on Trans forums or Reddit. For the most part, the goto surgeons have proven their competence at achieving acceptable FFS results. not by doing unnecessary surgery.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice if all this FFS surgery didn&#39;t involve risk, but it does. Facial symmetry is a monumental task with soft tissue. Add bone work to that underlying structure and you can understand why outcomes can be unpredictable.
</p>
<p>
Apply the 50 procedure rule.

It&#39;s a rule extrapolated from the a research paper by Dr. Cecile Ferrando at the Cleveland Clinic. Published in August of 2020
</p>
<p>
Adverse events associated with gender affirming vaginoplasty surgery
<br>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446999/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446999/</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Conclusion:
</em>
</strong>
<em>
The incidence of serious adverse events related to vaginoplasty surgery is low, whereas minor events are common. After a threshold of 50 vaginoplasty surgeries, these events were reduced, including the need for revision surgery.
</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In a nutshell, the study shows a surgeon doesn&#39;t gain full mastery of a procedure, thus reducing complications until they have performed the procedure as least 50 times.

I&#39;m kind of in the same exact boat as you. FFS is by far the most important surgery to me, and I want to be sure my surgeon is on the same page as me.
</p>
<p>
I have respect for these surgeons you mentioned and the good work they produce, tho I am becoming increasingly worried over what I&#39;ve been reading about Dr. DB. Not only did the case of facial masculinization both sadden me and scare me, but I&#39;ve also heard mixed anecdotes of his FFS results from former patients, especially when it comes to their noses. Not to mention I&#39;m reading he can have quite a proud personality and seem annoyed towards tweaks and suggestions you make towards your surgery which personally concerns me as this is huge and I definitely have aesthetic preferences I need met, though I&#39;ve never heard of him unwilling to make changes to his patient&#39;s requests either. I&#39;ve also read overwhelmingly positive experiences with him too in all fairness so I&#39;ll kind of just have to see for myself once I actually have a consultation with him.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m also torn on Keojampa, while a lot of his work is good and I do think he&#39;s a good surgeon, the girl who was amazing enough to share her negative experience with him on this sub kind of made me reconsider. I know these are more &#39;isolated&#39; experiences, maybe not what&#39;s typical and need to be considered with such factors in mind, but I personally find myself really listening to those who have experienced regret and less than adequate results when considering my options.
</p>
<p>
Have you considered Dr. Jumaily in LA? I&#39;m not sure what your FFS goals are, my most problemed areas are my nose and my forehead (with my nose being the biggest most important aspect to me) and I&#39;m starting to think he&#39;s probably going to be the best option for me. He also trained under Spiegel alongside surgeons like Keojampa and Mardirossian. I think if you need more lower face/jaw work he may not be the most ideal option though.
</p>
<p>
Best of luck with your search!

He&#39;s a good surgeon who does good work, but I&#39;m not sure if his aesthetic is what I&#39;m looking for.

ya i&#39;m wondering also. i didn&#39;t like he&#39;s work on Caitlyn Jenner or nikita dragun but i&#39;ve also seen some really good ones in this forum that look close to what i want. i think he pays attention to the aesthetics and doesn&#39;t just try and get you to look passing.

Yeah, my forehead and nose are also my problem areas.  I was considering Deschamps because I have a crooked jaw and he does Osteotomies, but I&#39;m also terrified of osteotomies in general, because of how extreme the procedures are, regardless of surgeon.    And the fact that many surgeons consider it a necessity to remove the front forehead bone to shave it down (in cases where extreme shaving is needed, such as mine probably), its just all around scary.
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t heard much about Jumaily, but I&#39;ll look into them.  Everyone in the California area seems very concerned with appearances in a respect different than just passing, though I can&#39;t say I&#39;m not concerned with wanting to look good besides passing, too (Hollywood being in California and all, so I&#39;m a bit paranoid about that myself)
</p>
<p>
Yeah, even if the negative experiences are isolated, they shouldn&#39;t be forgotten or brushed under the rug, especially by the rest of the community; I find it disingenuous and frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, after watching some videos of DB, he does seem sorta proud, and while confidence is good, one of his videos he talked about how FFS is basically a necessity because HRT will probably leave people dissatisfied, and I can&#39;t help but feel that that&#39;s kinda telling MtF women &#34;hey, get surgery, you won&#39;t be happy if you don&#39;t&#34;.  like yeah, that may be true, but I&#39;d rather have a surgeon that says &#34;hey, if you can be happy without surgery, power to ya&#34; instead of pitching the opposite.

ya i completely agree. good points. i&#39;m looking for an FFS who can really give me the aesthetic look i&#39;m looking for as well, not just passing. i want him to be a bit of a perfectionist especially in regards to the nose cuz i noticed many ffs surgeons aren&#39;t particularly that great at rhinos. they do a good job, but it&#39;s often not great.  i don&#39;t want to look done, but i definitely want a dramatic change and would love to look as close to my ideal and desired face as possible.

It‚Äôs awful that we have to be worried about doctors finding out about us or medical gaslighting.   A Hippocratic Oarh:  first do no harm.  And although everything says to ask surgeons for people they‚Äôve worked on etc, you can never do this and t.   Basically, your face and head is a HUGR deal and they expect us to just walk in pay and say do what you need to?!?
</p>
<p>
Anything like this still mergers a lot of pictures, conversations with patients five years down the line and images of what can and can‚Äôt be - as well as answers as to my their route may be different from another you consulted with.
</p>
<p>
Important business- we deserve to be informed and make our own decisions

It‚Äôs interesting because for me he didn‚Äôt.  I still know if need more forehead projection- totally flat, more cheek projection and of course browlift.   He suggested only moving the maxilla and a possible liplift which I appreciate.
