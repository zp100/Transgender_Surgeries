My entire experience with Dr. Hanna was amazing. It has set the bar for every other provider I‚Äôve dealt with, each of which has failed to compare. Some providers may do Trans Surgeries but it does not make them Trans Allies or advocates. Dr. Hanna is all of the above. I look forward to every visit with him and his staff. Nothing has happened that I wasn‚Äôt completely prepared for or told about prior.

Sensation is great! I‚Äôm still learning my new body but the mental part leads to even more intense sensations. No complications aside from some VERY common granulation tissue that was handled promptly and is now gone

I‚Äôve refrained from lengthy conversations about my experience because it‚Äôs so individual. I was quite comfortable in the hospital. So much so that I never took anything besides Tylenol‚Ä¶(minus one night nurse slipping me something for my painful gas..) but that was me. The team I had said they‚Äôd not seen that before. So I‚Äôm happy to share bullet points here for anyone that is curious but no one can guarantee what your experience will be like.
</p>
<p>
I can tell you that going into the surgery was scary but Dr. Hanna came to visit me just before and relaxed me immensely. The nurses were amazing, so sweet and gentle. I HATED the shower wipes! Don‚Äôt shave the morning of or the night before, give yourself a true 24 hours! The bowel prep sucks‚Ä¶ the hospital stay was nice. Dr. Hanna and his team visited me every day. The anti-nausea patch you‚Äôll get gave ME blurry, almost double, vision. I was hyper focused on my catheter because I was so afraid of not peeing when it was removed‚Ä¶ like so many stories I‚Äôve read on here‚Ä¶ Dr. Hanna is a urologist, so unsurprisingly I had no issues and pee‚Äôd like this had always been my anatomy. The more common things like wound separation and granulation, you‚Äôll probably deal with those too, just listen to him and let my photo be proof that you‚Äôll be just fine.
</p>
<p>
Trust the feelings you had that made you feel comfortable moving forward with this wonderful man

May I ask how long was the wait time from contacting their office to surgery date? Do they accept insurance or cash payments only?

I was trying to decide if I really wanted to go through with this surgery. Seeing your results totally convinced me that I‚Äôm only lying to myself about it. I called Dr, Hanna‚Äôs office and scheduled my consultation with them. It‚Äôs for May 8th. I‚Äôm so thankful that you shared your picture and experience or I‚Äôm not sure I would have done it. Thank you so much.

I‚Äôm glad that I made you happy, but you made me ecstatic. I just took one look at your result and knew I had to do it and choose him. Your courage to post that picture changed my life. I wasn‚Äôt going to go that far because of the fear I had but you changed all that and made me realize it‚Äôs totally worth it. Just talking to his staff was amazing, they are so sweet, I know I‚Äôm in good hands already. Thank you again. üíï

Hey, I had to let you know. I had my consultation with Dr. Hana on Tuesday and we talked about everything and I decided on shallow depth vaginoplasty. My past medical history makes full depth risky plus I‚Äôm a semi truck driver and there‚Äôs no way I could have dilated as I needed to. But the big news is that my surgery date is June 22. Two months away. I‚Äôm also having breast augmentation done at the same time. I‚Äôm not prepared to be full time at work but I guess this will force that issue now but so what.  I‚Äôm so excited this is finally happening. I told Dr. Hanna I had seen a patient of his post results on Reddit and that‚Äôs what got me interested in him and he asked me who you were but I didn‚Äôt tell him but I did tell him that her result was so beautiful and real that I knew he had to be my surgeon. You made everything happen for me. If you hadn‚Äôt posted that picture, I‚Äôd still be just wishing but you turned that wish into reality and have made a huge difference in my life. Just that little post gave me inspiration and encouragement and I‚Äôll be eternally grateful to you for that. Thank you again, you have no idea how much you did for me.

You definitely could have told him! His office has changed my life so much that we are like family now as much as I‚Äôm in contact with them. I‚Äôll be in their office Friday of next week for a Med Spa procedure. He probably has an idea about who you were talking about ü§≠ He loves doing a shallow vagina! I‚Äôm so happy that I could have given you even a little confidence in moving forward in your journey. I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE MY BREAST AUG WITH DR. HANNA! You‚Äôre in great handsüíã Happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è

I respect your privacy and it‚Äôs not my place to be telling the doctor anything about you and what you posted online without your permission, had I asked you beforehand I would have told him. Also, people use names online that aren‚Äôt necessarily theirs so I really didn‚Äôt know who to say you were but you can be free to tell them you pointed me in their direction. Nikki Laumann

Full disclosure: I am a ‚ÄúFreelancer‚Äù i.e a sole proprietor Hairstylist. I‚Äôm also currently in litigation for a commercial vehicle accident I was in.. With a pending surgery next month related to my injuries. I‚Äôm dealing with a lot mentally, physically, and professionally‚Ä¶ So I don‚Äôt feel that I am at a capacity currently to expand my little circle. I‚Äôm sorry if this seems rude. I‚Äôve just got a lot to manage as it is and I don‚Äôt think that I would have the bandwidth to nurture a new connection to the ability I prefer. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks for sharing this.  I&#39;m in a real conundrum because I&#39;m on Cobra and the wait times for most providers will put me outside of my coverage window.  I really wasn&#39;t familiar with Dr Hanna.  I&#39;m in TX also, down the road in Austin, and our options in this state have traditionally been less than stellar.   It looks like he does all three types, PIV, PPT, and Sigmoid Colon.  Could I ask which you opted for?

Just a quick question for those that went through Hanna. I know the site says hair removal not required with that said did the hair grow back in the wrong places after recovery. Trying to decide if I should get hair removal prior to surgery.

My consultation got moved up a month to April 25th. I‚Äôm so excited. Can you give me any details on how everything went? I only picked him because of the results I saw of his work and how happy everyone was with him but you having complications is now getting me worried. How long was it from your consultation to surgery? I was told 2-3 months usually.

My complications were purely constipation based and resolved with time and OTC intervention! Dr. Hanna and his team were amazing and responsive during the entire process.
</p>
<p>
As for the time between consult and surgery, I had my consult in November of 2022 and my surgery on March 28.  Most of that had to do with insurance eligibility for the surgery and not his schedule.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any other questions.

Oh ok, that‚Äôs understandable about your complications. Nothing to scare me off then. My insurance covers vaginoplasty and breast augmentation so I should get a date pretty quickly hopefully. I told them I can get off work anytime I want to and to let me know if there‚Äôs any cancellations so I can move up again.

Ok, I‚Äôm going to take advantage of your kindness and ask more questions lol. How long did you have to stay in the hotel before you could go home after surgery? Did you arrive the day before or two days before you checked into the hospital? How long was it before you felt able to go back to work? I‚Äôm more concerned about the recovery time to go back to work than anything else. I‚Äôm a semi truck driver and spend a lot of time sitting on my butt even though the work isn‚Äôt that difficult. I mostly just pickup and drop trailers. I also train new drivers so I don‚Äôt really do much of anything anymore except ride and observe. But I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to sit for long periods of time

So I‚Äôm only 12 days post-op so ymmv.
</p>
<p>
My surgery was on a Tuesday and I was discharged from the hospital on Saturday. My wife and I stayed at the hotel, I would recommend the Residence Inn that Dr. Hanna contracts with. We stayed in the hotel from Saturday to the following Wednesday. The total cost of the hotel for that time was around 900 USD.
</p>
<p>
I WFH, so I‚Äôm scheduled to go back to work next Monday. However, I currently could not imagine sitting upright in a chair for any length of time. The plane ride home, even with pain meds and a doughnut was pretty miserable.

Oh yeah at 12 days I would imagine that would be difficult. I‚Äôm hoping by 6 weeks I‚Äôll be ok to sit for a while at least. Me being a trainer, I could lay in my sleeper compartment and watch the new drivers from there so I think I can make do but I can‚Äôt be sure till I actually try it

I hope that I can afford bottom surgery some day, but as it stands right now, unless the VA starts covering it I don&#39;t know if I will ever be able to.

I‚Äôm sorry! I know that has to be debilitating, I was surprised and so grateful to be able to have my surgery. I know it feels like you‚Äôll never make it there at times. You should consult with my surgeon! He‚Äôs in the service and would be straight up about options and I know he does a self pay number that is reasonable. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã
