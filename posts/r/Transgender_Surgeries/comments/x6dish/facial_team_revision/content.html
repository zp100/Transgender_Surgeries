Hi new to Reddit, still learning how to use it so apologies.. it’s a little confusing where to post etc, I just wanted to ask anyone who has had surgery with the facial team if they have had a revision on their coronal scar and if it was successful ? I just want to put it out their I am NOT unhappy with my results and the facial team were fantastic I had a very good experience with them, but the scar has really started to affect my life and I’m feeling just as low as before surgery it’s extremely noticeable and makes me feel so low and embarrassed I was hoping I would never have to have surgery again as it came to a massive cost and YEARS of saving, I’m now going back for a revision which I have been saving months to cover the cost of and time of work etc, I just wanted to ask if anyone has had similar issues or a revision and had success, Ill admit I’m scared this is going to be for the rest of my life and will need constant maintenance and attention which is already making me feel so stressed and low, Thankyou for any replies, kind regards, and once again I’m not slating or attacking anyone I have just been unlucky perhaps
</p>

I have no direct experience, bit yes, I&#39;ve read from other accounts that they had a successful revision of the scar with facial team
</p>
<p>
They didn&#39;t have to pay anything except for the hotel I think? Maybe hospital fees too.

sorry I don&#39;t have much advice as I&#39;ve yet to have my FFS, but during the consultation with facialteam I asked about the coronal incision and they assured me that it would heal over some time and i didn&#39;t need to worry. If you don&#39;t mind sharing, what went wrong with your scar? is it a lack of hair regrowth at the incision site?

Basically the scar has stretched from ear to ear which is a complete line across my head with no hair at all right on the crown of my head so there is no way to conceal it, it’s very stressful and noticeable so I’m trying my best to cover it with hair fibres, I can no longer wear my hair down as it’s on the crown so is exposed completely, I feel embarrassed and I have noticed people occasional glancing noticing and then quickly looking away which makes me feel so low, so I’m praying a revision will sort it, I’m just scared that this will be a lifelong issue, I wish I had an understanding of scar tissues and how they might stretch when you have your hair tied back etc which I used to do I Never ever tie my hair back now as I’m scared of stretching it even more, I think actually having the scar on my forehead would Be have been easier to cover and treat then where it is now

Unfortunately the scar goes literally from ear to ear across the crown of my head like someone has literally cut me from ear to ear it’s pretty bad,I only went to facial team because they are apparently the best, however I originally wanted the works as in having hair line lowered etc, however they said this was not necessary and would leave a noticeable scar, they said my hairline was fine and that by doing it in the crown I would be completely invisible, they never ever mentioned anything about scarring or hair transplants, the only reason I had it don’t there was because they said it would be invisible , I would rather of had a scar on my forehead then what I have been left with, im hoping it can be fixed with a revision but I can’t believe I now might be faced with a lifetime of problems and possibly having to get hair grafts etc which im so scared will not take and for basically such a large area, im scared of what will happen in 4/5 years with the scarring or even hair transplants, I can never have my hair short and have to put hair fibres in to try and conceal the scar however I can’t get them wet or  move the hairstyle around at all, also when it is hot the scar literally burns and turns red, I feel so depressed I’m just praying a revision will solve the problem but I’m not sure, so many people have had FFS in Belgium etc in the more traditional way and gone on to have happy lives and yes of course things happen but I think it would have been more appropriate for me, I also lost a ton of hair afterward that has never grown back I feel it was to extreme for the surgery I had, after having a consultation in London about a possible revision the surgeon said he was shocked they would go for a coronal approach as this is usually a last resort used for brain surgery etc and people are told they will be expected to live with a scar etc and lots wear it as a sign of pride etc but obviously this was for a complete different purpose, it might seem trivial for others but to put my entire life savings towards this as a single person without family etc, now looking at getting a revision which has already put a huge financial stress on me, also with the factor that I’ve had hair transplants suggested has made me feel so low I just can’t believe I’ve ended up in a situation which could have been avoided, after looking at there site they seem to have updated their approach to a different area it looks like, I’m just venting but I feel so so low, I’m sure as trans people will understand the thought that people are looking at you staring noticing things that are different is very stressful, and the scar is such that people would stare, I would feel more comfortable having a scar on my head which I could conceal with makeup and more easily put topical creams and sunscreen on etc then what I have, it’s also more common and easy to make an excuse for, I’ve had someone tap me on the shoulder ask me when I was in a pub if I was in a car accident which was so embarrassing, I just feel so so low so I’m just hoping that a revision will help and if anyone has had any experiences that might give me hope
