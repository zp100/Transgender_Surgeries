Hello once again reddit, I&#39;m here to try and talk about things now that my revision has been completed.
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/jtxy40/more_updates_on_my_surgery_with_dr_gast/content.html">I discussed why this was happening a while back</a>
and you can link back to my original surgery reactions and such through there.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Anyway, I&#39;m going to start this off by being blunt: I still hate how everything looks. The revision helped slightly but not enough to make a serious change I can enjoy.
</p>
<p>

.
</p>
<p>
Suffice it to say, I hate how everything looks when my legs open up. My lower labia just plain vanishes. Now, I&#39;ve had sex with lots of cis ladies and a few trans ones too, but I&#39;ve never seen results that came out like this.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, I&#39;m disappointed. I likely have more dysphoria now than I had before surgery. I have such little depth I can barely even use my neovagina anyway, even after this revision to try and make it so I&#39;m actually wide enough at the entrance to do so.
</p>
<p>
I knew I wouldn&#39;t have as much skin to work with. Dr. Gast knew this too, I told her as much. However, she NEVER looked at my junk until the day of surgery.
</p>
<p>
I feel positive if she had I could have at least discussed zero-depth surgery as an option. Not only could it have saved me tons of time and thousands of dollars on electrolysis, but the healing could have been way easier. Oh, and what little skin I had could have been used to make something with good aesthetics that&#39;s way more sensitive overall.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I can have an orgasm now post-op. But the reality is I&#39;d honestly be embarrassed to show myself to any partner who wasn&#39;t warned a lot in advance about how things look. I currently feel gross trying to figure out how to even manage sex in the future. I don&#39;t want people even looking at it, or to have to remind myself how I look by seeing it. Dilating is now hell because that damn mirror stares back at me every day.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll really have an update post after this. Followup with Dr. Gast basically said &#34;sorry, there&#39;s not really anything else we can do&#34; so this is it. The scars will fade, but this is how I look.
</p>
<p>
Would I go to Dr. Gast or recommend her? She&#39;s managed some great results for other people and her team treated me well. However, the answer is no unless you can absolutely advocate for yourself and have a ton of knowledge going in.
</p>
<p>
I still think she could have helped me have a better turnout. Now I&#39;m stuck with what I&#39;ve got with literally no hopes of making it better. Barely three inches deep and I look like crap.

Gast was my chest reconstruction surgeon. I have ok results but nothing amazing. I found the whole no pictures to share thing kind of off putting—though I was able to see a few pictures thru Facebook and here.
</p>
<p>
There was a bit of a snag where it wasn’t until day of when she did the pre-op that I insisted she not leave any tissue and instead make me flat as possible. She wanted to leave tissue because I am a big guy. I am glad I made myself clear, but wow.
</p>
<p>
I had mine done at UW hospital and it really is a wonderful hospital.
</p>
<p>
I think Gast is very technically gifted but also a bit cookie cutter. I don’t think I’d consider her for ftm bottom surgery except that I live in the area and it’s convenient.
</p>
<p>
I find it pretty appalling that she seemingly has washed her hands of you. That’s something
<em>
bad
</em>
SRS surgeons do, like Rumer.

She did offer the revision as things as they were kinda ended up unfunctional. Lots of hypertrophic scar tissue on the entrance. No one&#39;s fault.
</p>
<p>
But like, I had VERY little skin going in. Like, I was dumb and assumed surgery was unreachable for me and got all the extra scrotal skin removed when I had an orchi years back.
</p>
<p>
She knew this, but yeah. Still acted like it would be 100% fine and no issue. I&#39;d have gone for zero-depth if I knew because I honestly think my result looks bad, especially compared to the others I found she did.
</p>
<p>
With so little skin to work with, there&#39;s likely not much to be done at all. I dunno if she&#39;s just trying to walk away or if you really just can&#39;t work with nothing, you know?

I mean I’m not a surgeon so I admit I’m just idk thinking shit up, but couldn’t a skin graft from elsewhere possibly do something for you? Like guys who get phallo have multiple skin grafts, sometimes even buccal. Idk I’m sorry this happened for you. She’s really too fast in and out sometimes at post ops, too.

I&#39;ve seen her a total of two post-ops, I&#39;ve always seen her assistant otherwise. I would agree, things move a little too fast at times. The most I think we spoke after the consult was the appointment before the revision.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d think a skin graft is possible too, but they seem to think my results are fine. I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m overworried. But the pictures I have compared to tons of the results from other surgeons or just her I&#39;ve seen?
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I got the bad end of the deal.

You could consult with a different surgeon. Perhaps one doing PPT.
