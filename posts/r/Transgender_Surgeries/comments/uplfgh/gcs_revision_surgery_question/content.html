Iâ€™m scheduled for revision surgery with Dr. Gladys Ng this July. She performed the original peritoneal flap vaginoplasty last May.
</p>
<p>
The main thing I want corrected concerns tissue surrounding my urethra. It looks a little bit like the stump of my old penis and when aroused becomes engorged. Not enough to protrude from my labia, but it partially blocks my clitoris. Not to mention that when turned on I get that sensation of arousal there that would happen before an erection. This feels terribly dysphoric. I want her to cut it all out so that my urethra is flush with the rest of my anatomy down there.
</p>
<p>
My question is does anyone else here have this issue?  Has anyone gone through this and had a successful resolution?  Thank you ðŸ˜Š

I have a similar issue where my urethral plate is way too big. It gets engorged when aroused and causes a lot of dysphoria. It is a combination of urethral and erectile tissue. Iâ€™m currently looking for a good surgeon to do a revision. I donâ€™t feel my original surgeon can produce a result I desire.

It may be an option to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.

may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.

A number of people have a revision for urethral issues. Its up to you ofc ... may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions.
