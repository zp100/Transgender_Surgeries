Hi everyone,
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m 24 days post-op vaginoplasty with PPT. Earlier in my recovery I had a lot of swelling which led to some sutures popping which led to a fair amount of wound dehiscence.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m slowly recovering and gaining a small amount of energy each day. But I feel like the pain never improves. Pain when I move. Pain when I dilate. Pain when I&#39;m just lying in bed (which is 99% of my day). Pain when I get out of bed. Pain when I try to sleep. Pain when I wake up.
</p>
<p>
I take my NSAIDS. I follow all the rules. I clean myself well with diluted hydrogen peroxide after each dilation and each trip to the restroom. I ice my vulva carefully and constantly. I take my pain meds on time.
</p>
<p>
The pain is always there.
</p>
<p>
It claws at my sanity.
</p>
<p>
I just have never experienced something like this in my life. I&#39;m used to getting an injury, resting up, letting it heal, pain decreases slowly as it heals, and then I slowly get back to normal. This is different. Going on 24 days of pain and I&#39;m losing a little of my sanity each day.
</p>
<p>
Any advice? I&#39;m following all of my post op instructions very carefully. I&#39;ve talked to my doctors about it. They say that we just have to wait for the wounds to close on their own. They say it may be weeks more before that happens.
</p>
<p>
Any advice or tips on managing ongoing pain would be helpful and appreciated. I had hoped that after almost a month that I would be doing better than I am.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: 24 days post op and the pain never ends. I&#39;m struggling mentally with how to deal with constant pain.
</p>

Ask your doctor for stronger pain relief. Im in week 5 and still on oxycodone in the evening. Gabapentin can also help.
</p>
<p>
I would have jumped off a building without the oxycodone at 28 days l

The gabapentin does help. I&#39;m on 2.7g a day, but recently I&#39;ve been having a lot of break through nerve pain despite this. I can&#39;t seem to stop the oxy either. I&#39;m taking 3-4 a day to keep the pain tolerable.

Try some other drugs. Some drugs can be safely taken together to increase their strength - some can‚Äôt so need to check with doctor. People respond differently to various drugs.
</p>
<p>
You could try tramadol, works for some and it‚Äôs not as addictive as many others in that strength. Some people get unpleasant side effects from it.

Thank you. I can try asking the pain management specialist about that. I just recently got a referral to one.

My psychologist also suggested weed or cbd. I don‚Äôt tolerate weed at all so it was out for me, but if you‚Äôre in a state where you can try it, it can be great for pain management

Did you recently end the percocets? I noticed a mental drop when I did.
</p>
<p>
SRS recovery is grueling.  It just is.  What you&#39;re experiencing is normal, and gets better by week 4-8.

I&#39;m taking a couple per day to help keep the pain at a tolerable level. It&#39;s just dealing with the constant pain that is wearing at my mind. I didn&#39;t think it would last so long at this intensity.
