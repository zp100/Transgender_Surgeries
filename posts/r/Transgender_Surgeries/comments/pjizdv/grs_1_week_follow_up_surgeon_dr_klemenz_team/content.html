So like I&#39;ve said in my
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/peyth3/ama_grs_dr_klemenz_team_markovsky_munich_germany/">AMA
</a>
here is my fellow up post for my first week post op.
</p>
<p>
Pls bear with me, my English is still not the best and formating in the app sucks.
</p>
<p>
First of
<a href="https://lensdump.com/a/9n3U9/?sort=date_asc&amp;page=1">here
</a>
the link how it looks the first week.
</p>
<p>
Now, how was it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 0
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was going down to surgery at 7:15 and made my first selfie after it 15:31 but I guess I was awake in a room before I was in my room ðŸ˜…. My surgeon came to me to talk later that day and told my that it was all good, no complications and that he used close to only scrotal skin for my vagina. The first feeling down there was like I&#39;ve had a really really right tuck.  Gladly I hadn&#39;t a bleeding down there, but my muscles acted strange that day and night. And I was in serious pain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 1
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was still ok, no serious bleeding but I was still in serious pain despite that I&#39;ve gotten to much medication. The problem there was that I only got paracetamol intravenous. And cause of this I wasn&#39;t allowed to get any painkillers till the evening.  This was a breaking point for me and I questioned if this surgery was right for me, cause I was in so much pain.  Also this was the day were I already should get out of bed. Since I&#39;ve hade problems with that they tried it 3 times and the 3rd was successful. Also in this night I haven&#39;t gotten painkillers, but narcotics.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 2
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Frist in the morning out of bed without help but a person still in the room and I&#39;ve gotten circulatory problems, so Back to lying in bed again ðŸ˜…. Since I&#39;ve had so much pain they tried to loosen the Bandage in the hope it will help (it slightly has). Still everything was ok and I&#39;ve got my cannula out of my arm.  But despite haven circulatory problems in the morning I was able to get out of bed a few times this day, also cause it helped against the pain from the stent.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 3
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This was the day were I&#39;ve gotten stronger painkillers (oxy) and with that I started to feel happy cause the pain was gone. They also removed the Bandage and 1 seam (since I haven&#39;t looked I would guess it was the right labia majora). Now the stent only felt like a to big dildo that you can&#39;t remove yourself ðŸ˜…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 4
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It&#39;s still ok with slightly bleeding. Since I wasn&#39;t able to poop already I&#39;ve got medication that it will be easier for me. I was also now ready to walk a little bit more and get my water from the patient kitchen.
<br>
And I was able to look at my vagina for the first time and it was hella cute to see her
<em>

</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 5
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was allowed to shower for the first time and had to get into the gynecological chair. Now the stent was removed, but since I had to much sore water (?) I&#39;ve got bandage packed inside my vagina again. The pain from getting the stent removed was also really strong, especially the inner part of it.  Since then I also shall cool my vagina 20 min 3 times a day.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 6
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Showering was hard cause my bladder started to cramp and cause of that, I&#39;ve got more medication, but my Bandage from inside the vagina got removed and despite the hard swelling especially from the labia minora the gynecologist was surprised how well it was inside.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Day 7
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was all ok again, despite slightly bleeding but not when they rinse my vagina there was close to no sore water again. But still hella swollen and all I can do is cooling.  This also was yesterday and it wasn&#39;t that much new here.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions my DM and chat is open and you can ask here. I&#39;ll try to answer as best as I can :3 (also I hope the formating isn&#39;t fucked up)

Thanks :3
</p>
<p>
Just yesterday I made a thread about it in German. Also yeah I haven&#39;t used Twitter as often as before cause I overshared on the main account and was in to much doxxing danger, that&#39;s why I switched to mostly tweet on my private account.

Haven&#39;t started dilating yet and tbh I really don&#39;t want to cause of how swollen my labia minora is, it&#39;s so swollen that&#39;s it directly in front of my vagina.
</p>
<p>
I would guess that I am going to start end of this week with it, when they try to remove my catheter.
