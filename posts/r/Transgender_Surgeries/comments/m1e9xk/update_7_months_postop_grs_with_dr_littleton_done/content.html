<p>
I&#39;m 7 months now post-op and am completely satisfied with my results. I have full sensation and can orgasm easily with clitoral stimulation.
</p>
<p>
I still have some granulation that&#39;ll be removed during the revision and a part of my labia minora also needs revision. Besides that I&#39;d say I&#39;m happy. Dilation is somewhat boring, I usually dilate during 40 minutes daily.
</p>
<p>
I get truly, I mean TRULY, wet when stimulated. Like, I&#39;ll be like leaking and dripping for a full half an hour after sex. I definitely don&#39;t need lube for finger penetration, but although I still haven&#39;t had penetration with dildos and such, I&#39;d expect the need for lube in such occasion. I have about 13 cm of depth and I feel that I can increase it with some dedication with dilation routine, but I don&#39;t really care that much about the depth.
</p>
<p>
Some scars are visible and I remove some local hair, but I doesn&#39;t bother me too much, and the scars are only on the top part. I&#39;ll link the other updates here and any other questions, please, be respectful when asking it. I&#39;ll gladly answer you all.

Sure thing. The Jejunum technique uses the jejunum from our intestines intead of using other parts like other methods do. The jejunum is capable of lubricating, doesn&#39;t smell, has lower chances of cancer, regenerates itself after being partly removed from the intestine, so you don&#39;t lose any part of it, has a good elasticity and its mucosa creates an environment similar to a natural vagina. Cis women have been having surgeries for reconstruct their vaginas using their jejunum for decades now.

No, the jejunum is a part of the small intestine.
</p>
<p>
The peritoneum (used in the peritoneal pull through form of surgery) is a membrane that lines the abdominal cavity.

The jenunum is in the peritoneum. But yes it is part of the small intestine.

Well, yes the jejunum is within the peritoneum, but so is the rest of the small and large intestine, and the stomach.
</p>
<p>
The peritoneal surgery is very different from the jejunum surgery.

Hey! Can you talk more about how Marcio treated you? Im thinking in doing a phalloplasty with him because Im from Brazil, but im afraid of how he understands dysphoria and respects trans bodies

Claro! Ahn, he isn&#39;t the most sociable guy I&#39;ve ever met. He&#39;s kinda closed, in the sense that he doesn&#39;t talk very much and looks serious all the time. I stayed in the hospital for 5 days and he would come visit my daily to see how I was recovering and to clean my vagina. He always looked mad because during the course of the day I&#39;d start closing my legs because it hurt to let them open for so long due to poor blood flow. At the end of the day I know he was caring for the best result I could get, so he cares. To me he looks like a person who values his own work and wants good results everytime. I don&#39;t know how he understands dysphoria, but I&#39;d think he sees it exclusively through medical lenses, since he isn&#39;t trans himself, but he never disrespected my body in any sense, nor phyisically nor with words. I&#39;ve seen some trans guys there, but they were all there for mastectomy, but they seemed to be treated equally as I was being treated. Pode me mandar DM sempre que quiser perguntar mais coisa dele também. Estou aqui para isso.

I felt 0 pain during my recovery. I only felt pain in the back and in my calves for staying bedridden for so long, but no pain in the surgery region. I mean literally zero.

Do you notice there is a connection point between skin and Jejunum? Is it like 1-2 inches of skin then jejunum? Is there risk of closing if don&#39;t dilate..    Can hair form in canal?

Hair can&#39;t form in the canal. There&#39;s no chance of that. I didn&#39;t have a single session of electrolysis and have no hair inside. I think there&#39;s a risk of closing of you don&#39;t dilate, but you need to go weeks and weeks without dilating or penetrative sex for it to happen. I can go a few days already without dilating, but when I restart my dilating schedule I notice my canal getting a little shorter and tighter for a few dilations, but I regain them quickly. Also I&#39;ll be 2 weeks off dilation during my revision and and surgeon told me it&#39;s not a problem at all if I was maintaing a good dilation schedule before the revision. I can&#39;t notice that connection between skin the jejunum.

Yes, I can fit the largest dilator. I know other women who have had the surgery with him too and they say good things about sex with men, but I personally can&#39;t answer that.

On citreous? What’s that?
</p>
<p>
And I don’t find dilation painful. It’s quite bothersome, but pain per se I don’t feel it by doing so. Specially if I start dilating with the penultimate size. It might be a little painful to start dilating from the biggest size. But once you adjust inside to the size you can go up easily. And I do feel sensation inside, although way less than externally.

Hi, my name&#39;s Robin. I&#39;ll be having my SRS with Dr Littleton in March. I was wondering if you have any more information on your recovery? You mentioned in one of the comments that you&#39;d be getting a revision at some point, may I ask why?
</p>
<p>
Happy New Year and my best wishes, Robin

U/auroritcha Hi, your post from 3 years ago was so helpful to me. Can you please tell me if you are still happy with aesthetics? Do you have orgasms and does your vagina lubricate naturally? All the best

Yes, it&#39;s kinda stretchy, I&#39;d say. I restarted my HRT about 1 month after surgery. Yes, he asks you to be in bed as much as you can. I didn&#39;t feel any pain *in* the surgery, that is, the vagina per se. But after a few days and weeks I started feeling a lot of back pain due to being bedridden and some pain in the calves due to poor blood circulation. Once I was able to walk as much as I wanted again the pain vanished quickly.

So do I! And seeing such good results from him leave me very hopeful (and sad that I missed this year&#39;s &#34;window&#34;)

Unless I&#39;m mistaken, he only operates in Brazil in the first months of the year. It&#39;s too late to schedule any surgeries, and I couldn&#39;t do so earlier due to financial constraints.

He does travel a lot, but he&#39;s in Brazil more often than not. I&#39;d double check with his secretary.

He operates during most of the year. I had surgery on August and know other women and men who have operated even later in the year.

Olá! Na sua outra postagem você falou que seu plano de saúde cobriu as despesas, como você descobriu que seu plano cobriria? Qual o seu plano? Obrigada!

Todo plano é obrigado a cobrir no Brasil. Só ir atrás dos direitos e se eles se derem de desentendidos fale que vai entrar com advogado. Só é necessário paciência.

Very nice result. Please auroritcha, can I talk to you? I will make a secondary surgery in Brazil. I am refining my options and Dr. Littleton is one in top of my list. Thank you.

Oi, tenho consulta com o Dr Marcio Littleton. Ainda Nao sei se devo ir na Tailandia com o Dr Banks. A estetica é super importante para mim. Você tem photos atualizadas dos seus resultados? Você tem orgasmos e lubrifica naturalmente?
