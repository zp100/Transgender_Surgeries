I took off like 8 weeks. Then I worked remotely as best as I could for at least a month more. Sitting was hard for quite a while. My FMLA only covered my pay for 6 weeks.

Walking was fine, but I got tired quickly at first. Sitting was the bigger problem. 4 months off work sounds like a lot to me. I think I was told not to lift heavy things for 3 months. I went back to the office after 2 I think and I went back to rock climbing at 4 months.

She and her whole team are wonderful. I found that they are always willing and available to answer questions or concerns. So ask all the questions you have! It was a really good experience for me.

I was covered by United Healthcare. I would think that BCBS is fine, but UW gender services should be able to tell you.

I had my surgery with her and had similar results but I am unhappy with it and want a revision. I ended up closing up. I quit dilating because I was having horrible pain and had bv. The post op doctor Claire was so mean to me I never wanted to go back and get help for my issues. When she had to dilate me I cried and she looked at me and said ‚Äúwell this is what you wanted‚Äù. Just so rude. My urethra opening looks very prolapsed or soemthing idk it looks similar to yours. Yours looks like they gave you more labia to cover your clit I have hardly any and it‚Äôs very exposed. Even 3 years post op my clit feels a little Raw to touch. There are definitely a lot of cosmetic parts of it I want redone by a more experienced surgeon.

That&#39;s a lot of hair down there. Don&#39;t you worry about ingrowns or any such issues?
</p>
<p>
And how come your surgeon didn&#39;t ask for electrolysis? I thought it was always necessary with standard inversion.

I did a full year of electrolysis to clear the shaft and part of the scrotum. She provided a pretty detailed map for the electrologist. She left the pubic hair that wasn&#39;t going to be on internal skin alone.
