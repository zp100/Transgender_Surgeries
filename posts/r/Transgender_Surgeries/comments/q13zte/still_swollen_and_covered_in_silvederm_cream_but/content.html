It will look better with time.  Give it 6 to 12 months for final result.  I know that is a long time, dilate, listen to your body, take care of yourself physically and mentally.

Hugs to you.  I am looking for a surgeon.  Working on my weight.  I am a doctor, it looks great except for swelling.  Will he let you use an ice pack here and there?  Hope you have a cushy pillow or donut to sit on.  Wish you the best, hugs.  Bridget

Oh good to hear from a doctor!! I am icing it though a little less today with moving from the hospital to hotel and dilating but I‚Äôm also taking Tylenol and another anti inflammatory to help. Hoping it looks much better in a few weeks lol!

It‚Äôs Dr Suporn‚Äôs method so modified PI. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a more specific name for his technique but the canal is made from scrotal skin and not from penile skin is my understanding.

Thailand seems like a bit of a mess right now, how did you go getting there, did the hospital seem stretched?  I&#39;m booked in with Banks in April.

The hospital I had surgery at didn‚Äôt seem stretched at all and the COVID situation isn‚Äôt ideal but honestly hasn‚Äôt been much of an issue aside from the quarantine (which just changed) and the extra paperwork getting into the country. I think it‚Äôd be hard to vacation here (and mildly unethical) but it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre going anywhere so it hasn‚Äôt been a big deal.

What was like this doing dilation for the very first time? Did it hurt with you being so swollen? An if you could rate it 1-10?

Mm it‚Äôs definitely hard to describe. The first dilation Dr. Banks did the in hospital immediately after taking out the packing and so that one didn‚Äôt really hurt it just felt uncomfortable and so weird! My second dilation was definitely harder and I would say getting to depth was like a 5-7/10 but once it was in and I was able to breath it was mostly just uncomfortable but not too bad. I‚Äôm about to do #3 though so I‚Äôll see how that goes! I can‚Äôt really compare it to any sensation I‚Äôve felt before but I‚Äôd say it hurts like the same amount as like a slightly sensitive arm tattoo if that‚Äôs relatable? But not as sharp mote like a stretching pain.

The &#34;Suporn Technique&#34;. It is his own and is recognized as that. It has

similarities

with a scrotal graft but there is a bit more to it than that.

Hi, I have a couple of questions about your SRS (To be honest there are a lot of questions): What made you choose Dr. Bank over Dr. Suporn and other doctors (It&#39;s on my short list and I have doubts who to go with)? How has your recovery been so far? Do you recommend Dr. Bank? How consider your results in terms of cosmetics and sensitivity so far? How is your vaginal depth currently? How is the dilation process? Do you know if Dr. Bank used the tunica vaginlis in your surgery? Are you planning to have revision surgery? And if you want to undergone one, What would improve your result with one? (It is very swollen, but is a very good result, especially consider than youu have one week post op) How is your stay in Thailand (Chon Buri)? What is the aftercare like for Dr. Bank and the clinic staff in general? And by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

Yeah happy to answer! I‚Äôm a little tired from dilation so let me know if I miss one.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
I chose Banks because of availability mostly but also I‚Äôve heard from many people his results are identical if not a little better. I didn‚Äôt know going into it but apparently he does speak better English and has better bedside manner. I can‚Äôt compare but I really liked him.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My recovery has been pretty smooth so far I think. The hospital was super super easy and I was always able to get quick pain relief when I needed it. I would say my highest level of pain was like a 7-8/10 at night and they were super fast. I‚Äôm just to the hotel now and I‚Äôm able to walk pretty far but sitting just sucks lol. Dilation is also hard. Like a lot harder than I thought it would be but the painkillers help.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As far as my results I guess I‚Äôm happy? I have no clue how they‚Äôll look but they seem like they‚Äôre going to look good. I have no numbness anywhere either. Way too early to tell about anything sexual though but I‚Äôm not concerned about it right now.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My depth is like 6.25‚Äù roughly? Plenty enough for me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I think I answered a bit above but dilation sucks. It‚Äôs painful and takes a lot of time. I‚Äôve heard that it does get easier after the first week or so so I‚Äôm hopeful but yeah it‚Äôs hard.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It seems like Dr Banks does mot use the tunica vagnalis in every surgery but gave me the option. I opted for it but he did say there is a higher risk of granulation at the seam of the graft.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Unsure about revision. It‚Äôs free with the clinic so maybe? But also like I have no idea how it will look in the end? Someone from the clinic said about 10% of people come back for a revision.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So far everything here in Thailand has been great! Quarantine was a bummer but the hotel made it easy and the rattanschol hotel where you stay after surgery is super fancy. The clinic also handles like all logistics which is a big stress relief.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please let me know if you have any other questions or feel free to dm me! üñ§

Why do you have silverderm in there?   Did the doctor give a reason?   I used that extensively when I worked in a burn center and that‚Äôs definitely not the standard of care for surgery sites.  That‚Äôs not even enough cream for it to be effective.

It‚Äôs used as a disinfectant after dilating or using the restroom. I‚Äôm not a doctor so I can‚Äôt confirm it‚Äôs actual efficacy but Dr. Banks seems to take it very seriously.

<p>
In the us it‚Äôs used almost exclusively for burns and sometimes for pressure ulcers.  I‚Äôve never seen anyone use it on a surgical site.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs a good medication, but using it after dilating or using the bathroom is weird.  It suppresses staph and other bacteria on the skin, it‚Äôs definitely not a disinfectant.
</p>
<p>
Do you know of anyone else using it like this?
</p>
<p>
Sorry to pry but, I‚Äôve been a nurse for a while and am very familiar with this medication as I used it multiple times a day in burns.  We used pounds of it per shift.  It‚Äôs just odd to see it being used like this.  Why not chlorhexidine?  That‚Äôs an actual disinfectant routinely used for surgical sites and cleaning.  It was most likely used on your surgery site along with iodine during prep for surgery.

Honestly could not tell you why it‚Äôs used except as a disinfectant for more regular use. It‚Äôs intended just for the labia minora and clitoral area so maybe it‚Äôs helping prevent infection while also being less caustic? I am also washing with hibiscrub before and after dilation, douching with diluted betadine post dilation, and applying betadine to the suture lines post dilation so definitely not solely relying on the silvederm. I‚Äôm super interested in why and how everything works though so thanks for bringing up this curiosity!
