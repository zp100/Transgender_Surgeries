Not to minimize your feelings, but FFS takes months to heal and it&#39;s still
<em>
way
</em>
too early to be judging the results. Your entire face is healing up and things are going to be shifting around for a while.
</p>
<p>
My nose looked super uneven too for the first few weeks after my FFS, and I was horrified at the results (the post-op depression certainly doesn&#39;t help with that). It did get a lot better over time though, and it&#39;s now at the point where you wouldn&#39;t notice any unevenness unless you were specifically looking for it.
</p>
<p>
Did your surgeon recommend you tape up your nose at all?

I already have a consultation with 3 surgeons, one lightly told me that it appears like there’s a problem that will need correction but he said to wait 3 months and we’ll know for sure. But I already know it’s botched, based on my previous experience with surgery.

I’ll be updating through YouTube and Reddit. We’ll see in 2-3 months. According to multiple plastic surgeons I’ve spoken to, by that time we will be certain about what my nose is going to look like. I’m already fairly certain, as I said before I’ve had a rhinoplasty before. The concerns I had 2 weeks post op from my first rhinoplasty never resolved.  I had some cartilage issues and I was told to wait. Yeah that never got better but I’m going to wait anyway so everyone can just accept this isn’t going to change with time. Lol

Yep, I hope I didn&#39;t come across as too dismissive or made it seem like I was saying this will go away entirely. I meant more that there&#39;s a really good chance it&#39;ll improve over time and become less noticeable and fall within normal ranges.

I doubt it, considering that the swelling made it look a lot better. The swelling puffed out all the irregularities, the swelling has been going down very very quickly for me, since I’ve completely cut out sodium from my diet, take arnica and bromelain tablets, drink lots of water and anti inflammatory foods like ginger and tumeric teas and beverages.  As the swelling subsides, my nose looks more and more fucked.

I’m 2 weeks out from a rhino too... it really messes with your head but pls give it a bit more time... yes u still may need a revision and yes it may not be perfect but it probably will get better... what has really helped me with swelling and healing is taking arnica tablets.  If you’re not on them you should start right away.  And the nose is changing so much at this point. Two days ago my nose was twice the size... and I also have uneven nostril swelling so that’s very common as well.  Pls hold out hope angel.  And also, nose swelling aside you’re actually stunning.

Thank you, I do take arnica tablets as well, and I also take bromelain and the swelling has reduced DRAMATICALLY. All the people Ive spoken to that went to Dr.Zukowski say my swelling is much much better than they where at my stage so that’s good. Bad because I can see the contours of the underlying bone and cartilage more and more each day. But oh well..  revision here I come.

I hope you’re right because this is eating me alive tbh. It’s like a rollercoaster. One moment I’m okay and the next I’m suicidal and spiraling. Thank you for your words of encouragement ♥️♥️♥️

Honestly I feel the same fkn way one moment u see a bit of potential and then the next you’re like wow wut da fuck did I do to my face...  the best piece of advice other than arnica and taping is to stay the fuck away from your phone camera.  Seriously it spirals me. Just leave it alone and completely ignore it for as long as possible.. and honestly.. I live in the nose tape right now and it helps cause it hides my nose so I don’t get upset every time I look in the mirror.  Trust me the more u stay away from your camera the better you will feel 100%

Yeah I live in nose tape, and a mask now.  It actually looks better on camera, the mirror is what truly shakes me to the core. Like woah.. that’s my nose dude lol that’s my fucking nose WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK DID I DO?! I’m just trying to focus on the fact that I’ll have this fixed in a year and with covid I get to wear a mask most of the time.

Honestly I’d considered working at Starbucks and having all your revisions paid for by them and then going to Harrison Lee in Beverly Hills.
</p>
<p>
I had sub par ffs with Spiegle and Dr Lee’s work has made me feel completely in love with my new face, in particular my nose. He had to redo my entire ffs and then some and I’m in love and I’d highly recommend him

I’m so sorry this happened to you. This is one of my biggest fears about surgeries, but at the end of the day I know it will make me better in the long run. It won’t be easy to hear, but just stick it out, and I know one day everything will be as it should be. Stay strong sis. Love, Amy.
