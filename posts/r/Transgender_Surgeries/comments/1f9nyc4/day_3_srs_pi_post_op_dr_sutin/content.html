Today I got up for the first time after surgery, the nurse and my wife helped me with that 🙏🏻  It wasn&#39;t hard to get up, probably because I was too tired to lie down and my ass looked like a square 😂 I walked a bit to the window in the ward, looked at the beautiful view of Bangkok, stood some more and lay down. In 3 days of lying down I realized that if you think you have a lot of energy, it&#39;s a deception. I sometimes didn&#39;t have time to finish my lunch because I was tired and needed to sleep for at least 10 minutes to continue. So I didn&#39;t rush into walking, you have to get used to it gradually.
</p>
<p>
The bandage is very disturbing for walking, as well as the tampons in the vagina. The bandages are supposed to come off tomorrow and maybe tomorrow I will go to the bathroom for the first time with a laxative.
<br>
Morphine has been discontinued, more pain but I&#39;m managing. 4/10. A couple times I&#39;ve woken up during the day from a severe spasm in my vagina, like being electrocuted, very painful and unexpected. Sometimes colicky in random places, unpredictable, probably recovering nerves. 🌡️ Temperature 36.6 - 37.8 during the day.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully tomorrow the bandages will come off and I&#39;ll be a more free. Really looking forward to walking again and really looking forward to the swelling reducing.  This day has been quiet, nurses come in often, about every hour, lots of food, I&#39;ve been washed, lots of taking care of me and sleeping. We&#39;ll see progress from here on out, I feel like I&#39;m recovering well. ❤️

Glad you’re healing well.  Walking helps with blood flow. My week in the hospital at Piyavet found me walking 3 times a day. I was determined to get my strength back and to heal.  I had the sigmoid done by Dr burin at Pai   You got this

Glad you’re up and able to get a few steps in. Did they replace morphine with something else? I’m assuming they did.

Sounds like your journey has been pretty good so far ! I still need to wait for another 3 more years before I can get my surgery
</p>
<p>
Looking forward to hear more from you, especially since I’m considering PAI to get my surgery
