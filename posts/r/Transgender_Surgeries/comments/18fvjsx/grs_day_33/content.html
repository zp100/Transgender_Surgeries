Hi people! I‚Äôm on day 33 after Grs in Slovenia by Dr Petrovic. I‚Äôm still feeling tired and it‚Äôs hard for me to do things like go outside for a little walk (my vagina is still swollen and I‚Äôve a little wound dehiscence at the V point - don‚Äôt know how to explain - where I insert dilators :) ), but I can basically do everything at home like cooking, using washing machine. The only hard thing it‚Äôs to cleaning up my cat‚Äôs litter. I started working full time remotely on day 12 from the hotel and I‚Äôm able to work regularly (I‚Äôm only slower and I need some extra breaks according to my boss like have time to take a tea or to have a little walk at home). I stayed at hospital 11 days cause I had problem with catheter (they removed and put catheter 3 times, I wasn‚Äôt able to pee and it was the worst pain I felt on my entire life). I had catheter definitively removed at day 14 and I was cleared to go home 5hours drive from the clinic. I dilatate 2x a day for 45 min and dilatating is so boring!  Some day I bleed from my urethra after the first pee in the morning (not a lot of bleed, just some bleed) when I think I had hematoma after surgery. I send pictures to my doctor and he say it‚Äôs nothing bad. I‚Äôve got some pain, especially in the evening when I‚Äôm tired I feel pain when I‚Äôve the dehiscence and some times I feel something like ‚Äúelectric pain‚Äù at my clitoris and I‚Äôm feeling some ‚Äúpressure‚Äù at my vagina. I described pain to my partner and friends like someone kicked me on the b@lls (I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt know how to explain better, English is not my native language). My depth is 5 inches I think (I only see the last dot of soul source dilator) and I‚Äôm happy because I had standard inversion with scrotal graft. I can‚Äôt wait to go back to my normal life, like go out for a dinner and see my friends and ride motorcycle with my partner. The recovery it‚Äôs really hard and I didn‚Äôt thought was hard like this.

Hello,  I&#39;m interested in how it was with the genital hair, doctor asked me electrolysis before the operation, how do you feel now and are you satisfied with the result?

Hi, I did laser before surgery as recommended from the surgeon. Now I‚Äôm 9 months post op and I‚Äôm dilating 1x a day for 20 minutes and I‚Äôve got 5 inches depth (little after last dot on Soul source). I‚Äôm satisfied, it looks natural and everyone told me it‚Äôs a good result.

I feel you but I found a clinic that was friendly and staff was so nice. I focused on my surgery and I‚Äôve been able to do it, just know you‚Äôre doing that for one big reason.

As far as I know laser is required everywhere in EU. The only place where laser is suggested and not required is Thailand.

Supposedly with Dr. Kanhai in Rotterdam, it is not needed. I will try with him, would home IPL give satisfactory results, what do you think?

Absolutely not, only medical laser or electrolysis or the risk is to have hair inside after surgery. Home IPL is not permanent as reported on technical instructions.

It will help the next person who&#39;s considering your surgeon. Its a bit scary to read nothing at all.
