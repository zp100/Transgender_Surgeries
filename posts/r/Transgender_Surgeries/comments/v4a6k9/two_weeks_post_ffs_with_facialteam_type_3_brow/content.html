Thank you so much! The most important thing for me was being able to tolerate my reflection, and this has completely gotten rid of my facial dysphoria

Agree with the first comment. May I ask to see what the incision hidden in the hair looks like at 2 weeks? Completely understand if not.

Of course! So I had surgery on the 23rd, so it&#39;ll be two weeks on Monday.
</p>

<p>
The first two pics are on the top of my scalp. I&#39;ve had a lot of scabbing and inflammation around these areas, especially on the left side. It was at it&#39;s worst a couple of days after surgery, then fine for a while, and became bad again after travelling a few days ago. It&#39;s all fine now and I can see some sparse amount of hairs coming up on the line.
</p>
<p>
The last pic is from the side of my head and I&#39;m amazed at how fast and well it&#39;s healing. There&#39;s no active scabbing and virtually no missing hair. It&#39;s the same on the other side.
</p>
<p>
One thing I didn&#39;t expect is the amount of flaky dandruff on my scalp. It makes sense, and I have a lot of dry skin around my forehead and nose too but it was definitely unexpected

Thank you so much!!! Good luck with yours!! The best advice I can give is wear the hilotherapy mask as much as possible. I only didn&#39;t wear mine to get up and walk/go to the bathroom and have had such little swelling and bruising.
</p>
<p>
Can&#39;t wait to hear about your experience!
