My clit is a little irritated... this picture was taken post masturbating, so maybe that&#39;s why...
</p>
<p>
I have been given permission to use lidocaine and an antibiotic cream to make dilating with granulation easier. I only have a small section, and a small section of graft rejection. Neither warrant any action and they&#39;re healing well on their own. It&#39;s just slow going due to the perpetual moisture inside the vagina.
</p>
<p>
Sensation is almost fully back. She&#39;s always ready to play whenever I am. I am learning what she likes, and enjoying figuring out the techniques. My vagina is awesomely sensate, though I can&#39;t play with anything too big yet due to the granulation, my medium dilator has proved to be a handy tool when I&#39;m in the mood. My libido seems to be elevated since surgery...
</p>
<p>
I have an abscess where my testicles used to be, but it&#39;s not related to the surgery. Odds are, it formed due to a small hernia that formed sometime afterwards.
</p>
<p>
I have been a bit bad as far as dilating goes, and I&#39;m working back up to my recommended 2x daily. I have been struggling to do anything due to a battle with sepsis and pain in my groin. This abscess may need to be surgically drained, but my doc is on a wait and see period right now. The other thing is, there maybe another small fistula that got missed. I&#39;ll be tested for that later in the month.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: I love her. She&#39;s mostly happy and healthy, and I&#39;m extremely happy that I went through this. The pain and issues have been worth it

Is the sepsis related to surgery? My husband almost died of sepsis caused by an abscess on his inner thigh. Be careful please!!

No. Apparently, it&#39;s a result of a possible tear/hernia.

I have had several potential hernias due to a lot of heavy lifting.
