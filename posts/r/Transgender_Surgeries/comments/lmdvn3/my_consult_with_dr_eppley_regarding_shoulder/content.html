Hi all, you may remember my post here from the other day, to which this is a follow-up-
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/lh3cxn/can_you_all_help_me_find_what_more_body_surgeries">https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/lh3cxn/can_you_all_help_me_find_what_more_body_surgeries
</a>
</p>
<p>
-where I asked about what more body surgeries I should talk to Dr. Barry Eppley about. A few commenters said &#34;share your experience when you hear from him!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Well, I had my consultation and got a quote, so I&#39;m here to report back!
</p>
<p>
He&#39;s a really friendly guy, as my other surgeons I&#39;ve met with have been, and we talked about shoulder reduction, rib removal, temple implants, breast augmentation, and he briefly mentioned hip implants though I&#39;m more interested in the first few things I mentioned.
</p>
<p>
He said basically nothing that isn&#39;t already available info on the wiki about shoulder reduction, which was fine, I think surgeons have to talk over the procedure.
</p>
<p>
We then discussed rib removal, which he assured me as to the safety of, the way most people attest that it&#39;s a safe procedure, and he talked about how he could at the same time do liposuction on the region as well as remove some of the musculature that holds together the removed ribs (the intercostal muscles, I believe)- a bunch more than I bargained for and I&#39;m really excited about!
</p>
<p>
This would provide me with the smallest waist I can get on my frame, which I desperately need because as numerous people have pointed out, my body is craaazy boxy and I need work done on it. He noted that lipo alone wouldn&#39;t be a good option, given that I&#39;m fairly lean (where he got this idea, I don&#39;t know, quarantine has not been kind to my waistline!), though I&#39;d definitely like to pursue lipo in the future on places like my arms and back that need work, if I can&#39;t manage to lose more weight there.
</p>
<p>
I also stated that I wanted to do breast augmentation, on the recommendation of some of the people here (thanks for you input, y&#39;all!) which he said adds a day or two of recovery time in tandem with another procedure and would be easy to do. This is also true of temple implants, which offer the advantage of being long-term solutions the way fat grafting isn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
However, he stated that after-care being a big concern, he&#39;s reluctant to both rib removal and shoulder reduction at the same time the way he would be willing to do both BA and either procedure because of how incapacitating both are. After making it clear to him that I would have the help of my family afterwards, though, in contrast to most of his patients who go to him alone, he was more amenable.
</p>
<p>
Doing both procedures means staying the night at the surgery center, which ups costs, and so the quote I got for following through with both at once comes to a little more than $40,000.
</p>
<p>
Recovery itself will take a month or more, mostly due to the shoulder procedures, during which you have very limited arm mobility. I&#39;m not sure how to dilate during that time, but dealing with my man body is absolutely a must so I intend to find
<em>
some
</em>
way.
</p>
<p>
In any event, I&#39;m happy to answer any more specific questions that I can- honestly, he provided little more information than is already available on the wiki and I haven&#39;t gotten a timeline for scheduling from their office yet, but I&#39;ll be sure to update this post when I do hear back from them!

Idk... as far as health goes, I would be more hesistant with silicone implants than removing some of the bottom ribs, which I agree with eppley that they are useless... it&#39;s the surgery itself that Eppley says is dangerous... whereas living without those ribs doesn&#39;t change much, especially ribs #12 and #11

I was obsessed about my shoulders. Thought they were too broad but after measuring the Biacromial Breadth I noticed that it sits right on the average women value (35.4 cm), but I still have lots of fat around my arms which makes it look broad, Itâ€™s getting better everyday. Have you measured your biacromial shoulder breadth?

based on your photos i&#39;d recommend not doing the shoulder reduction. i don&#39;t think its worth it for your body shape. if you get your hips augmented a little to bring them out to be more proportional with your shoulders, plus the rib removal, you&#39;ll be in really really good shape.

Eppley operated on me in 2015 and it is literally the worst mistake I have ever made. Google the reviews to confirm. His talent is marketing NOT surgery.

My previous care coordinator told me about &#34;rib excision&#34; being a listed procedure and I think my current insurance referred me to a clinic that did ffs soft tissue (i need my bones touched though so I still need to follow back because) They did talk about body contouring procedures that seemed to be covered. This isn&#39;t all out of pocket is it?
</p>
<p>
I watched a video of a shoulder reduction surgery and I&#39;m personally worried it&#39;s so much effort for what might not make as big of a difference as I want, but my one shoulder is already in a bad crunchy condition. I&#39;m small though like 5&#39;5&#34; 120lbs so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m too far different from your dimensions so I would be definitely follow up to see how things turn out if it does what you want from it. I know it pulls the shoulder together forward and inward and I know holding them like back farther helps them to appear smaller so which is sort of opposite.
</p>
<p>
That whole reworking around the ribs, can you tell me a little bit more about that? I&#39;ve never heard of that just the &#34;shortening&#34; of the bottom 2 floaties.

It does make a small difference in the shoulders, sure, but I think it&#39;s worth it depending on your dysphoria. It takes a few centimeters off and since the difference between the average men&#39;s vs women&#39;s shoulders is within the realm of centimeters, I think it makes a bigger visual difference than one might assume.
</p>
<p>
As for the ribs, a lot of it is definitely resectioning, where the surgeon takes and moves around the ribs rather than removes them, but I believe Dr. Eppley takes out most of the last ones- 10, 11, and 12.

omg, wait what? I thought it was simply just shortening the bottom two which amounts to basically no difference. Do you have any before/after for that one you can send me? Is there any way the #9 rib can be adjusted?

sorry, I&#39;m honestly probably not explaining this well- I&#39;m looking for the page on his website about it but I&#39;m not finding it rn. Here&#39;s the resource on the triple-tissue removal he does I found:

Honestly I&#39;m not incredibly sure on the specific science-side of how it works, I&#39;m sorry!

That&#39;s actually very helpful! Thank you. I&#39;ve been having trouble finding anything like this that wasn&#39;t a VR photoshop from Korea with zero actual information. I&#39;m not bitter, I swear, lol. I&#39;ll be having a conversation with my health care caseworker right quick!
