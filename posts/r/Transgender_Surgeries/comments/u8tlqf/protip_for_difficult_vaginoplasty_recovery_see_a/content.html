Seriously.
</p>
<p>
I am 8-months post-op and ever since surgery I struggled with some really bizarre pain and uncomfortable sensations.  I felt like I needed to pee 24/7 and there was a constant unpleasant ‚Äúbuzzing‚Äù sensation in my pelvis.  I was worried about nerve damage, like permanent nerve damage, and I wasn‚Äôt getting much in the way of support from my surgeons office.  They basically told me that the nerves were still healing and there wasn‚Äôt much else I could do.  My primary care physician wrote me a prescription for Amitriptyline which helped me sleep, but not much else.
</p>
<p>
I ended up in PT due to a car accident and I mentioned what I had been going through since surgery.  My PT asked me to get a referral from my primary care physician for pelvic pain and she would have me see the pelvic floor therapist.
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you that my life has changed these last three-weeks since I started seeing the pelvic floor PT.  She didn‚Äôt know much about vaginoplasty and told me early on that she would probably treat me very conservatively because she didn‚Äôt want to hurt me.  Her theory behind my pain/sensations is my body tensing-up the pelvic floor muscles following surgery due to the pain and trauma of the procedure and now they can‚Äôt relax.
</p>
<p>
She had me use my fingers to stretch my labia and gently disrupt the scar tissue which has helped desensitize the area a bit.  She has also had me start doing stretches to relax my pelvic floor and stretch my groin muscles.  The uncomfortable sensations and urge to pee have decreased tremendously and I have finally started to feel like I can enjoy myself following surgery.
</p>
<p>
If you are struggling with a difficult recovery it could be worth it to ask your surgeon if pelvic floor PT is right for you.

The surgeon I&#39;m going to actually requires it as part-op care.

Yes! As someone who works in HC, more patients (both trans and cis) should see pelvic health physical therapists!
</p>
<p>
They help with so many aspects of the pelvic floor like pain, weakness, dribbling, urgency to urinate, tightness during sex, etc

I am utterly convinced that physical therapy is some sort of sorcery.  I couldn‚Äôt move my arm all that well after my car accident and had numbness and tingling that I was almost certain had to be nerve damage.  Through gentle manipulation and stretching I have regained all the movement in my arm and numbness and tingling is gone too.  PT is amazing and I wish people knew more about how much it can help.

I can also vouch that pelvic floor physical therapy helped me a lot also.

I too had pelvic floor PT as part of a difficult recovery and revision of my vaginoplasty.  It helped tremendously, plus the the therapist brought out a vibrator and showed me how to use it help relax the tense muscles.  She also added that I might really enjoy it!ü§£

Can&#39;t agree enough! I just started seeing one now. If anyone is in the DC/NVA area DM there&#39;s a great local person who has discount pricing for 5 sessions for non cisgender individuals.

I think everyone I mean EVERYONE who gets Vaginoplasty should be sent to a pt. I‚Äôm 5 months post op and my pt saved me, I was in so much pain and now it‚Äôs getting better more rapidly than I could have possibly expected
