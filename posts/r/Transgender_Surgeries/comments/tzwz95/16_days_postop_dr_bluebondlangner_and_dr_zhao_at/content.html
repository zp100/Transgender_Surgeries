<strong>
TL;DR
</strong>
</p>
<p>
NYU is amazing, the Nursing and support staff are spectacular, and my healing is going very well. I highly recommend NYU and I think what sets this apart is the support staff! Also, hair removal sucks! Ask me anything
</p>
<p>
This is going to be a long post so I just want to prepare everyone, but I wanted to go into detail about my surgery with Dr. Bluebond-Langer and Dr. Zhao. I had surgery on March 24, 2022. So right now, I am 16 days post-op. I will go over the pictures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pictures
</strong>
:
</p>
<p>
First picture, is of the first time I saw my vagina you can see there is lots of swelling in the labia majora but everything else looks pretty good. Catheter is still in
</p>
<p>
Second picture, is my first dilation with blue dilator in the hospital I got to the 4th dot
</p>
<p>
Last picture is me today 16 days post op. I am dialating with the green dilator and the last dot is at the entrance of my vaginal canal. So roughly that is about 7 inches (which I am super happy with!!)
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Experience in hospital:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I cannot say enough good things about everyone in the hospital. The nursing staff was amazing all my nurses were absolutely fantastic. I had minimal pain. The biggest discomfort was the gas pain which is what they said would be the worse. However, I wouldn‚Äôt say it is worse than any other time I felt super bloated it just took a long time to go down. They do give you GasX which did help my pain level. I did take the narcotics until day 3 in the hospital, but I have not needed them since.
</p>
<p>
The support staff at the hospital were also amazing I had a visit from the integrative care nurse which did some reflexology and some mindfulness meditations with me and that was super helpful. Finally, we need to talk about Kevin. Kevin is a divine human and is your go to for dilation. He came in on day 4 and gave me all the information I could ever want on how to dilate.
</p>
<p>
The final day in the hospital which is was Tuesday March 29 is a lot. At 6:30 am Dr. Zhao came in and removed my vaginal packing. This was not painful as many others have talked about, but it is definitely no pleasant either, but it is over fairly quickly in about 10 seconds. After that Kevin came in and we did my first dilation.  All I can say is that I don‚Äôt know how I would have done it without him. He made everything so simple, and my first dilation was successful. My favorite saying is that I need to use ‚Äúgay amount of lube‚Äù which is a lot.  I then went and finished with a douche. Douching to me is by far the weirdest part of this. Sticking a little red tube up there is weird, again not painful just weird. At this point it is about 10am. At 11:00am Kevin comes back in and we do a second dilation. Already I am getting the hang of it and it goes much faster. By 12:00 we are out of the hospital and on back to the AirBnB
</p>
<p>
Again, my overall experience with the hospital was amazing. All of the nurses were very caring and were there to help me through it all. The support staff again is amazing. Dialation is often the ‚Äúworse‚Äù part of the surgery, but I found with Kevin‚Äôs coaching and help it has not been bad. Even now it is not painful it is just tedious more than anything. Dr. Bluebond-Langer and Dr. Zhao are great and amazing surgeons, but I think what really sets NYU apart is the support you receive after your surgery.
</p>
<p>
I am going to go into a little bit of detail on the preparation I did for surgery. I am happy to answer any questions about this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hair Removal:
</strong>
This by far is the worse part of the whole surgery process. It is so much worse than anything I experienced in the hospital. Anyways, I had 5 sessions of laser hair removal. I live in Massachusetts and so was able to go toe Mass General Hospital for this. Which worked out well because they could bill my insurance. Laser is intense but is over pretty quickly. I think the whole procedure lasted maybe 3-4 minutes. Highly recommend using Lidocaine. It made a world of difference. Finally, I did two sessions of electrolysis each 4 hours. This was awful as you can well imagine. I did choose to go to Dr. Spiegl‚Äôs office (he is a FFS person) because they did lidocaine injections. The shots were awful but it made the actual electrolysis almost painless. There would have been no way I could have done it without this. However, it is expensive. I think it was close to $1300 dollars. I am still waiting to see if my insurance will pay for it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Weight
</strong>
: Dr. Zhao and Dr. Bluebond-Langer did ask me to lose weight before the surgery. They wanted me to lose about 25 pounds before the surgery. This was probably the most difficult task but I was able to accomplish this because I had already been seeing a weight doctor at Mass General. So, when I went into surgery, I was 3 pounds from their goal which was fine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Time
</strong>
: From start to finish it took about 1 year and 2 months. I had my first consultation on Feb 9 2021 and then my surgery on March 24, 2022. I know this is pretty fast compared to some of the wait times she has now, so I feel very lucky I didn‚Äôt have to wait very long. I will say that the year was necessary for all my hair removal. That was really painful, dysphoric, and mentally taxing endeavor so I was honestly glad I had the time to space out my appointments. This helped greatly with my mental health.
</p>
<p>
I am sure there is more to be said but I will leave it at that. I am happy to answer any and all questions. I hope this is helpful to people out there!

First of all, congratulations!! üéä
</p>
<p>
I was wondering how was Dr. RBL and Zhao‚Äôs bedside manner and pace on the actual day of surgery and the hospital time?  I had a consult with them and I really loved them and their mannerisms but I will admit they were a bit rushed at times because I‚Äôm sure they are super busy, but is it different when surgery time rolls around?

Not OP but I had a different surgery with Bluebond at NYU. It‚Äôs true she can be really rushed, but it‚Äôs because she has SO many patients. I can‚Äôt imagine the number of surgeries and how many people she sees in a week. But her bedside manner is really exceptional for the amount of time you‚Äôll see her. For my procedure I saw her for literally a minute before the actual surgery while she drew on me. It was chaotic but I truly wouldn‚Äôt have gone to a different surgeon. My results are better than I ever could have imagined and when I had an emergency on my 20th day post-op (which was a Sunday and no one was in office), RBL personally called to talk to me and calm me down.

So not OP but I had a Vaginoplasty with them just over a month ago and they&#39;ve been very on top of my personal situation (complications of Crohn&#39;s disease almost delayed my surgery) and I even tho sometimes I only see them for 20-45sec during an appointment they seem to really be on top of their patients. Also the nursing staff is amazingly friendly and highly educated.

Have you had any complication after surgery, to do with your Crohns? I have cd as well as srs is becoming really complicated to get for me! I haven‚Äôt talked with any actual surgeons only GIs, an they aren‚Äôt really advising it. (But I really need it!!)

So the biggest issue post surgery related to my Crohn&#39;s was the bloating, it took me longer than the average patient to stop being bloated, that hurt a ton and was prolly my Crohn&#39;s fault. Besides for that I didn&#39;t have any issues (I had to stop my humira meds for surgery but only missed 1 dose)

Oh okay! I find I am bloated these days an I figured it may of been because of weight gain, but could be because of CD as well. An I‚Äôm also on humira!  Did u have any history with fistulas? were they hesitant of preforming surgery or was it a pretty easy process ? Xx

So I&#39;ve had bowel surgery previously for fistula. Buy my gastro did my yearly exams before my srs to just confirm I was healthy enough have surgery. Dr Bluebond-Langner and Dr Zhao were both aware and on top of my Crohn&#39;s and had been in contact with my gastro to coordinate my care (mostly they only disagreed on how long to be off my meds, my gastro didn&#39;t want me to stop at all and the surgery team wanted me to stop for at least a month they settled on 1 week)

They were fine. I didn&#39;t see them much. They came in a total of like 3 times and only for about 10 minutes each time. But yeah they are very busy. Honestly I didn&#39;t really care that I didn&#39;t see them because really it is the hospital staff that is most important in my opinion.

That‚Äôs great that the hospital staff are amazing! Makes it worth waiting!

Also, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible but did you get a say in what your vagina looks like or had any particular request for RBL? (Like larger labias, etc?)

I honestly didn&#39;t ask. Her work is better than just about anyone I have ever seen so I just let her do her thing. She did an amazing job and I am super happy. I was very pleasantly surprised at how pronounced the labia minora was. But yeah I know others have asked her and she had said she would try her best.

Seems like suddenly all of the NYU patients are suddenly posting here. Are they asking people to? Haha. It&#39;s not like they are having trouble filling their wait-list.

Well that&#39;s great. I am scheduled for surgery with BBL&amp;Z in December and have been really happy with their team so far. So I&#39;m glad to hear so many good things.

I can say that there are some surgeons who will ask patients (I won‚Äôt name names ofc) to make posts on Reddit and promote their social medias like crazy. The nice thing about NYU Langone is that they are very protective about that kind of stuff and I‚Äôve NEVER known them to ask patients to do any kind of promotion for them; plus they really don‚Äôt need to, they are over the roof busy as they already are anyways. Also, Bluebond and Zhao patients are extremely nice and kind about their posts and guidances in particular, so that‚Äôs nice.

That all sounds right. I&#39;ve just noticed a sudden barrage of posts. Which is good, because it further inspires my confidence.

Thank you for posting your post-op experience and the photo of the dilator going in. I haven‚Äôt seen much photos of patients with the dilator inside after the first day the stuffed condom was inserted. I personally had my vulvoplasty in October 2019. At the time I was honoring the time request off from my work place to get the surgery done. The one thing I didn‚Äôt take in to consideration was that fact that this Covid pandemic was to come three months after I left my surgery state I was in in Portland, Oregon and flew back to Hawai‚Äôi return to work.
</p>
<p>
I do plan to have my vaginoplasty vaginal walls soon in the coming year or two years how ever long or short I can get on a wait list for. I have purchased a few soul source dilators prior to surgery because that was the original surgery I wanted vaginoplasty, but last minute my nurses at my transgender care center talked me out of it. I really wish they didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt mind going under again, but this time have my vaginoplasty done.
