So far so good. The only problem I&#39;ve had so far is the hospital nursing staff giving me stool softener, which has resulted in me shitting all-over myself for the past day, but I&#39;ve managed to keep my dressing clean.

Hi, thanks for doing an AMA! Is there a particular reason you chose Dr. Rodriguez? And please correct me if I am wrong but isn’t she also relatively new, and if that is the case, did it cause any anxiety?

She is new. It didn&#39;t bother me though, as she has extensive plastic surgery experience.
</p>
<p>
I chose her because her schedule was relatively open, and because she was in-network with my insurance.

Awesome! Thanks for the answer. A follow up: what was your timeline like from first contact to consultation, then to to your surgery?

I contacted them for the first time in March of 2018.
</p>
<p>
My surgery was initially scheduled for May 16th of 2019. When Satterwhite left and I was pit with Rodriguez, my surgery date was changed to May 2nd.
</p>
<p>
Due to certain life circumstances, we then pushed it up to April 3rd.
</p>
<p>
So frim the beginning to my surgery was roughly one year and one month.
</p>
<p>
(I should note that at one point she tried to schedule me for December, but that didn&#39;t work with my schedule.)

That’s really cool, I’ve looked at their website and they have really good results! I hope you give us a follow up when everything is healed up!
