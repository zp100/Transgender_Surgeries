My eyes don&#39;t focus quite as well since I had a brow reduction, and I&#39;m getting a little worried about it.

I had brow surgery back in September of last year. In most respects, it went fine - result is cosmetically good, no terrible scars, sensation is slowly returning, etc - but one thing I noticed quickly was that it left it a little harder to focus my eyes. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s radically altered my sight, but there&#39;s a sense of weakness in them that wasn&#39;t there before, and when I lie on my side or try to look at something very close up, I find myself going cross-eyed.
</p>
<p>
My forehead also feels quite stiff and tight, and I still have relatively little muscle control. I can&#39;t really raise an eyebrow on its own (though I can raise both at once like normal), for example, or squint without it feeling weird.
</p>
<p>
Is this within the bounds of normality, or should I be concerned?

I see that you went with Bart. It sounds like a functional issue. I also had surgery with him and now have complications. He is to my opinion a mixed bag and seems to be performing surgeries he is not quilified to do. Like you, I had the impression he rushed my surgery too. I have both cosmetic and functional issues.

It&#39;s been over 3 months for her though and she went to Bart. I doubt he would know what&#39;s wrong with her even if she asks and he would likely say &#34;IT&#39;S NORMAL&#34; like he usually does when someone has concerns. You may even have hematoma and he may say &#34;IT&#39;S NORMAL, IT&#39;S JUST SWELLING&#34;
