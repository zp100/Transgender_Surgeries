A few days ago I used a vibrator down there for the first time and while I really enjoyed it I wasn&#39;t quite able to reach orgasm but today it just happened. The orgasm itself lasted longer than usual (maybe 15 seconds) and I&#39;m not gonna lie... It was the most intense climax I ever had in my life. It was like shock waves going through my body. I was shaking involuntarily for minutes afterwards and I was so so happy. 🥰
</p>
<p>
It really helped me to focus on the sensation and to hold my breath a bit. I also tried to contract the pelvic floor muscle a lot.
</p>
<p>
To my surprise I got really wet after a few minutes of stimulation. Before the surgery I had a lot of pre-ejaculate when aroused and I&#39;m relieved that I didn&#39;t loose this ability.
</p>
<p>
edit: I would only try this when you are completely healed.

I do kagels religiously and my orgasms are through the roof better. I would suggest them to anyone wanting more intense orgasms.

100% agree! I always experimented with contracting my pelvic muscles in all different kind of ways during masturbation and it can do crazy stuff to your orgasms. Building solid pelvic floor muscle control really stepped up the game for me. :D

I really wish someone had told me this years ago. I didn&#39;t have an orgasm for like 4 years, no one told me I had to
<em>
learn
</em>
how to orgasm as a woman.. pre HRT the process was automatic.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been doing kegel exercises and practicing different way of clenching my muscles while using a vibrator. I haven&#39;t achieved a &#39;full body orgasm&#39;, but it&#39;s definitely improved things and I had one that went up my spine a bit and made me super giggly.
</p>
<p>
Uh, so yeah.. pass on the knowledge please.

That’s what I do all the time + contracting the pelvic floor muscle rhythmically. By doing so I was able to have as many orgasms as I like even before SRS just using a vibrator. I didn’t really train this tho.

(That’s my alt acc btw)

I was curious about what exactly causes the better orgasms: regular kegels or contracting the pelvic floor muscles immediately before and during orgasm. I asked Chat GPT and got this helpful answer:
</p>
<p>
Kegel exercises can help both men and women have better orgasms. Here&#39;s how you can use Kegels to improve your sexual experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Identify your pelvic floor muscles: These are the muscles that you use to stop urinating midstream or to hold back gas. Contract these muscles for a few seconds, then release them. This is a Kegel exercise.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Practice Kegels regularly: It&#39;s important to do Kegels regularly, every day, to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Aim for three sets of 10 Kegels per day.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Experiment during sex: Once you have stronger pelvic floor muscles, you can use them during sex to enhance your orgasms.
<strong>
Experiment with contracting your pelvic floor muscles during intercourse or masturbation. Try different rhythms and intensities to find what feels best for you.
</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Combine with other techniques: Kegels are just one tool in your toolbox for better orgasms. Combine them with other techniques, such as deep breathing, mindfulness, and clitoral or penile stimulation, to enhance your sexual experience.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Remember, it takes time and practice to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and to experience the full benefits of Kegels. Be patient and consistent, and you&#39;ll likely see improvements in your sexual satisfaction over time.

Thank you :) I wish you all the best. Just wanted to add that it normally takes longer to have the first orgasm. (I think up to a year is still super common)

If you think that was great, wait until you have a multiple orgasm. Congrats! I had a similar experience to yours. Getting GCS was the best and most important thing I ever did for myself.

Things really seem to go similar for us haha..
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t had an orgasm yet, but it started feeling really good one time I dilated during third week, had a wet dream a few days ago and got close to it yesterday. I&#39;ve been getting horny the past couple of days.. but I&#39;m still too sore it seems.
</p>
<p>
But the sensation truly is.. wonderful. Not entirely different to before, but much better. And it&#39;s really a lot of experimenting with contracting the pelvic muscles..
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure if the release will be different or better.. nor if it will last longer or not.. how sensitive I will be afterwards.. but I&#39;ll probably find out in a few weeks.

Yup, our recovery is shockingly similar. :D
</p>
<p>
The soreness almost completely disappeared a couple days ago and this definitely helped.
</p>
<p>
Another advice I can give is to not think about anything surgery related because for me that topic is a big turn off. I just tried to concentrate on the clitoral stimulation and nothing else.
</p>
<p>
Yeah and the vibrator helped a lot. :D I think it would not be possible for me to get off only using my fingers at that point. :D
</p>
<p>
I plan to upload more pictures in a few days because she is a lot less swollen by now. :)

Don&#39;t worry too much. My surgeon told me that it&#39;s very unlikely to loose the ability to orgasm if you had it before.
</p>
<p>
Before surgery it was the same for me. When properly aroused I got soaking wet and now it&#39;s no different. The glands responsible for that are not removed during surgery.

Congratulations girlfriend,  I&#39;m waiting and day dreaming still for my day to be post opp.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve always had really low T before Transtion and hardly had any amount of ejaculate and have absolutely zero now after over a year on hormones but I get extremely wet also and to the point of wearing pantie liners but the orgasams I have now does me the same way as you described.  Lol
</p>
<p>
They are the most rocking my world experiences that last anywhere from 20-30 sec and I squeal like a baby pig and shake afterwards.  I&#39;m 55yo and have never ever had as enjoyable orgasam as I do now. And that&#39;s by myself  I couldn&#39;t imagine if someone else was giving it to me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m extremely happy for you and I will just keep dreaming of the day I make it to where you have. ✨️ 🥰🤗

i’m almost exactly a year post op, and I haven’t been able to orgasm yet. It’s sensitive, and it’s exciting, but I get nowhere near orgasm, and it’s not improving. I think I might have to get used to the idea that it’ll never happen again… and that won’t be easy - although I knew the risk was there.

If your clitoris has sensation you should be able to reach orgasm eventually. Before surgery I experimented a lot with pelvic floor muscles contractions and was even able too achieve orgasms through anal sex only.
<br>
I&#39;m convinced that stuff like this is a skill people can learn. Some are even able to climax from nipple stimulation only.
</p>
<p>
Just don&#39;t give up and keep doing it with positive things in mind. Just concentrate on the feeling and contract your pelvic muscle when you get close. Then just keep going. Try different toys, vibrators or what ever works for you and I&#39;m sure it will come sooner than later. :)

Storytime
</p>
<p>
I was about 3 months into HRT (still have all the OEM equipment) my levels were nowhere near where they need to be but one night deep into a 🍄 trip my wife started to play with me.  When I take my therapeutic dose of mushrooms I loose cognitive control of my body. It takes complete focus for me to even move my arms. Well she got me to a place I had never been before. The waves and waves of orgasms just kept coming. My whole body was convulsing and shaking for at least a half an hour after she stopped. I was a puddle of goo. Not even talking about the amount of body fluids that was produced. That was the first female orgasm I experienced.  Estrogen is powerful stuff.

Yes it is for sure but everyone is different. Some cis women have very unspectacular orgasms. It just varies too much between individuals to draw a clear line between &#34;this is a female orgasm&#34; and &#34;that&#39;s a male one&#34;. Hope that makes sense.

I get that, but compared to my pre HRT orgasms this was completely different experience. I have gotten my wife to this same level of orgasm in the past. Shaking to the point of not being able to speak or move. My wife has asthma and there have been times I thought I was going to have to take her to the ER so she would start breathing again.

Mine are veeery different compared to pre-HRT too. But it&#39;s not like this for everyone. Just saying that to make no one feel under pressure to have full body orgasms when they don&#39;t.
