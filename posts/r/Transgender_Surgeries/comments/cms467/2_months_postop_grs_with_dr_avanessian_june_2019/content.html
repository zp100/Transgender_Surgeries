I think a lot of people have probably heard how amazing Mt. Sinai is, but here&#39;s my experiences (link to pics at the bottom).
</p>
<p>
<em>
Why I picked Dr. Avanessian
</em>
</p>
<p>
First, I wanted someone covered by my insurance. Secondly, I had the chance to serve as caregiver to someone having surgery with her and observe first-hand how things would go.  I found her incredibly sensitive to what can trigger dysphoria-- she clearly chose her words carefully when speaking to me-- especially about my genitals. I liked the surgical results I had seen from her. Her use of a woundvac for post-op care makes life a lot easier-- just lay on the couch and let the pump run.  Finally, the only requirement she made about hormones for me is to stop them the day before surgery and resume them with the next regular dose after surgery.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Pre-op and costs
</em>
</p>
<p>
I had my pre-op appointment at the end of Nov 2018 and she was scheduling surgeries in Feb 2019 at the time. I opted to have a June surgery because I needed time to have hair removal done. At my pre-op physical exam Dr. Avanessian was concerned about my skin not being as elastic as she wanted so she suggested I tuck aggressively for the 6 months prior to surgery.  In that time I also did about 40-50 hours of electrolysis. Surgery was covered by insurance (Allways Health Partners) and our out-of-pocket cost was $2500.  I do not live in the NYC area, so my only other major fixed expense was renting an airbnb for about 5 weeks for $5500 (20 min from Dr. Avanessian’s office), but I found places closer to $3000 if I were willing to have a much longer commute. I booked my airbnb about 6 months in advance (as soon as I had my surgery date) and the prices would have been almost double had I waited. Be prepared for the high food costs in NYC though-- while not strictly necessary it was generally easiest for me to use FreshDirect and simply have my groceries delivered.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Hospital stay/Results/Recovery
</em>
</p>
<p>
The hospital staff were excellent.  All the nurses were incredibly kind and supportive-- they’ve all clearly veterans at caring for people post-GRS.  If I pushed the call button a nurse was always there right away.  My pain was well managed with gabapentin and OTC ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I had little, if any, bruising and my depth is 6.5 inches. I have not had any UTIs or yeast infections.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Overall
</em>
</p>
<p>
I am very happy with my results so far.  I found post-op to be as easy as I could hope for.  All the medical staff was well-trained and extremely kind.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Relevant info about me and surgery
</em>
</p>
<p>
I’m 36, in good physical health, and had been on HRT for about 18 months at the time of surgery. For surgery, I had a penile inversion without peritoneal graft.  Dr. Avanessian thought I had enough material to work with and did not think I would greatly benefit from doing a peritoneal graft.  She was clear with me that she would do the graft if I wanted it but it would require a second surgeon to obtain a graft.  Personally, I did not want a delay and trusted her instincts.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Hospital stay (days 1-4)
</em>
</p>
<p>
I had the best anesthesiologist I’ve ever had, Dr. Nik.  He did a fantastic job because I woke up feeling fairly alert and with no nausea. I immediately broke out into a huge smile when I woke up because of how obviously it didn’t feel like I had a penis anymore. My woundvac had a leak the first night and the nurses patched it until morning until Dr. Avanessian did rounds and fixed it.  I definitely felt the packing when pressed on during fixing the leak.  The only other major event during my hospital stay was almost passing out trying to use the toilet.  The nurses came immediately and helped me get back to bed.  They told me it was fairly common and I did feel better after laying down and drinking water for awhile. I took a Lyft XL to the airbnb.  It wasn’t as bad as I expected with the catheter and woundvac as long as I had the seat reclined.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Days 5 – 7
</em>
</p>
<p>
During this time I was at an apartment in Brooklyn.  I was not able to do much more than get up for the occasional trip to the bathroom during this time.  One evening the woundvac did clog, but my wife was able to unclog it by calling the help line.  They had her turn it off and back on basically.  By Day 7, I was sore from how much the swelling had gone down with the vacuum still on. I had my one week follow up to remove the packing and catheter.  The tape covering the packing hurt a lot coming off! I was still too numb inside to feel anything too intense when the packing and catheter came out. I was told I needed quite a lot of packing (14 units) so my vaginal canal has quite a bit of girth in addition to depth.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Weeks 1-2
</em>
</p>
<p>
Pain at this point generally feels kind of like a blister or sunburn on my crotch.  External skin felt pulled tight, and the incisions were still very sore and scabby. I started dilating twice daily for 30 minutes with the smallest dilator (purple) and get a depth somewhere between the last dot and the thumb notch.  I didn’t find it painful, just messy. I was able to start showering during this time, but it was very tiring. After my 2 week follow up I moved up to the blue dilator.  It wasn’t very painful but I could definitely the “fullness” from it when dilating.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Weeks 3-4
</em>
</p>
<p>
I definitely started to feel more alert and like myself at this point.   Everything was obviously swollen still but I could start to move around a little easier.  I moved up to the green dilator in this time. This is was the first time I started having discomfort while dilating, but the discomfort passed after a few minutes at full depth.
</p>
<p>
<em>
Weeks 4-8
</em>
</p>
<p>
At 5 weeks I was treated for hypergranulation (lower part of my vaginal canal) with silver nitrate and got clearance to make the 5 hour car trip home.  It was pretty tiring but not terribly uncomfortable except for bumpy roads or stop-and-go driving. Once home I made it to the largest dilator and continue to get the same depth as when I first started. I have some sensation both inside my vagina and little from my clit at this point.  I can definitely get aroused but I’ve not wanted to push things too far because my incisions are still pretty sore. I started tapering down on some pain meds (gabapentin) during week 7. At 2 months, I’m finally able to get around the house without too much pain or difficulty.  It’s still uncomfortable to wear clothing on my bottom half (but doable when needed)- my incisions still are pretty sensitive to chafing.

I had my consultation with her last week and now I&#39;m just waiting for a date. Thanks for sharing, this post has helped reassure me that I&#39;m making the right choice in seeing Dr. Avanessian

Thanks!  At 2 months, I still feel amazing at having gone through surgery and have no regrets. But I definitely have times where I&#39;m impatient to be fully healed up and back to a normal activity level! :)
</p>
<p>
Oh that&#39;s a great point about the peritoneal tissue-- I think I hadn&#39;t fully realized that when she explained it to me pre-op!  I completely believe it with how much self-lubrication there is...

Getting the packing and everything out was the single best thing to help with that early on! The first real shower in a week feels amazing. :)

Oh 6.5&#34; was what they told me right after surgery when I still had packing in-- sorry for the confusion.  When I started dilating I do remember feeling like the back of the canal would feel like it would &#34;open up&#34; after the first bit of dilation and I could slide in deeper.  After awhile I no longer had this feeling anymore and just went straight in to that full depth.

Hah... oh good question! For me I think it was somewhere around 2-4 weeks where I stopped noticing spraying so much.  For me it seemed to correspond with just having swelling go down and getting used to changes in how to use various muscles.

Once the drains close (around 2 weeks post-op for me) I had significantly less bleeding.  It was probably around 4 weeks post-op before blood totally stopped.  I had a lot of protein fluid draining out of me until around 6 weeks or so.  Once the protein fluid stopped I just use a pad to dilate and not to sleep on.  Morning flow is still definitely a thing for me but it&#39;s pretty much just self-lube at this point. :)

You wrote during week 1-2 you felt your external skin was pulled tight. When did you get used to it? Do you still feel the tightness now?

It felt that way for the first month or so.  It definitely feels comfortable now and not tight-- the skin will flex if I poke it but bounce back to hold its shape.

I’m also going to chime in and say how helpful this post was for calming me down a little. I am 2.5 weeks out from my consultation with Dr. Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
I am so excited to be on this path and the anticipation gets to me. I just have to remember to stay patient and I’ll get there!

I can definitely relate to this.  The waiting and pre-op stuff like hair removal can definitely wear you down. No matter how close your date gets staying patient is definitely the hardest (and most important) part-- you will definitely get there though!

For my wife and myself it was around $200-$250 a week for food.  Full disclaimer: I have diet restrictions so you can definitely do cheaper groceries if your diet is more flexible.  She was also cooking for us a lot as take out tended to be around $20-$40 for the two of us per meal.   From where we were to Dr. Avanessian&#39;s office was around $20-$30 one way on a Lyft.

Sure.  Keep in mind I&#39;ve still got some swelling still.  It will probably be 6 months before final appearance.
