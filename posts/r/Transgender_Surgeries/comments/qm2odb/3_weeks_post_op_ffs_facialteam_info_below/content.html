Procedures include
</p>
<p>
Type 3 forehead reconstruction + orbital barring + brow lift (coronal incision)
</p>
<p>
Rhinoplasty
</p>
<p>
Jaw + Chin reduction
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery with FacialTeam on the 13th of October and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my results! I‚Äôm still pretty swollen in  my chin+jaw and my nose (especially from the front) My side profile was always my biggest insecurity on my face prior to surgery (don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing my before publicly) and now I cannot stop taking pictures from that angle üò± The entire experience with FacialTeam was amazing and honestly could not find any room for fault.  My one apprehension going into surgery with FacialTeam was the possibility of my result being somewhat conservative as I had seen this a couple of times on this thread. I can positively say that my expectations were met and I am already in love with my result! They done exactly as I asked.  Any questions about my experience I‚Äôd be happy to answer ü•∞
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm going to do another post once I‚Äôm further into healing documenting the entire healing process starting at the day after surgery!

Hi, you look gorgeously feminine. Congrats. Can I ask you who was/were your surgeons that operated on you for your eyebrow lift, orbitals and forehead? Did you have a breast augmentation? If yes who was your surgeon? And are you comfortable sending me a photo of your face pre op please? Just to have an idea of what FT can do. Thank you so much

Hey, thank you so much!! The surgeon that performed my forehead surgery was Dr Miguel Juli√° Mart√≠nez. He was really informative in my pre op consult.
</p>
<p>
Yeah I had my breast augmentation 2 years ago with a surgeon based in Edinburgh, Mr Ken Stewart. He specialises in trans patients and I think he‚Äôs the government advisor to cosmetic surgery in Scotland. I‚Äôm super happy with his results too!

I think due to the fact that I‚Äôm insecure about posting my before pictures due to the dysphoria I had that was the deciding factor for me getting the surgery in the first place would indicate that I do not look the same. I wanted to post my result so that people would see FacialTeam‚Äôs work and if it helps anyone then that‚Äôs great! I have no time for sarcasm darling, please leave it off my posts in future‚ò∫Ô∏è

Only question I have is did you have your lips done previously because they certainly look like they have been done.  I only question because your lips look fabulous to, no way on gods green earth is anyone going to know you‚Äôre anything but female.

Thank you so much I appreciate it‚ù§Ô∏è Yes! I have had my lips done, I haven‚Äôt had them topped up since July 2020 so they have dissolved quite a bit since then. I used to go every 6 months or so for a 1ml top up! I‚Äôm planning on getting them dissolved and redone sometime soon to freshen them upü•∞

I honestly prefer lip filler over getting the fat transfer because I love the way Hyaluronic acid fillers plump and hydrate under the skin! I‚Äôm usually pretty routine with them and I love the look, just had a little break from them in the run up to my FFS

Also have the lip filler fairly regularly but it‚Äôs over a year since I did due to Covid and I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised how they‚Äôve stayed good.  However, I think I‚Äôd prefer the full time one off surgery now

Aw thank you so much, I really appreciate it. Prior to surgery I passed but I definitely had a harsher facial structure than I do now. Certain angles and definitely taking pictures would trigger me and I would find myself editing them and picking my face apart and kind of gained a complex with it. I definitely would say I still look like me, just with the exact feminine proportions I wanted before, softer and didn‚Äôt feel at all self conscious about posting those unedited pictures which is a first for me in years!

Yeah no problem!
</p>
<p>
So my bestfriend came with me and took amazing care of me! I rented an apartment close to the hospital rather than staying in la villa Marbella as it worked out so much cheaper for a lot more space. That being said if I went alone I probably would have opted to stay at la villa Marbella with the nurse check ups and hotel being used to FFS patients staying there‚ò∫Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
I think you should plan ahead and take extra time off from work, would that be 2 weeks following surgery? Or getting home? It‚Äôs a pretty personal thing, but I experienced a few headaches in the first week and needed to be in a dark room. So I would leave working until the minimum of getting back home to the US.
</p>
<p>
In regards to pain medication, honestly the surgery itself isn‚Äôt particularly painful! But it‚Äôs your head and you tend to feel more discomfort in that area. During my visit to the hospital they had me on stronger pain medication through my drip (I‚Äôm not sure if it was morphine or oxy but it was one of the two) But after I was discharged it was ibuprofen to help with any pain and swelling. They give you a few sleeping pills too which are great as nighttime is the worst time for the discomfort. I think they can give you stronger meds on request but I‚Äôm not 100% sure. Like HiddenStill mentioned they use ultrasonic tools during surgery which really lessens the impact damage done to your face and it isn‚Äôt particularly painful as such üòä

Thank you so much! A coronal approach to the incision is when its placed further back in the scalp, so that it‚Äôs totally covered by hair once it‚Äôs healed. It gives a more natural result compared to a hairline approach (but different needs vary) My brow lift is scarless as it‚Äôs performed during the forehead surgery where they remove a small strip of skin which pulls the eyebrows up higher and they then place little hooks that are dissolved into the body once fully healed which keeps them even higher and in place as the soft tissues heal. My cost roughly was around 30k euro without accommodation etc, I was quoted that in the early summer though and I know they change their prices regularly. The wait time for me was a little over 3 months but I think in general it‚Äôs a 3-6 month wait from consult. Consultations are free with them you should check on their website!

I had surgery with them 2 weeks before you, same procedures + far transfer, and I&#39;m amazed by how fast you are healing! FT healing is good in general, but it looks you are on a fast track even for them.
</p>
<p>
My jaw is still very swollen and nose also far away from healing (but it think it got more work done than yours).
</p>
<p>
You look amazing and results are stunning!

Ah no way! How are you getting on girl? Thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Honestly I would say I‚Äôm pretty blessed with good genes, I heal from things pretty quickly anyways. But prior to surgery I worked out 5 days a week, ate a balanced diet and drank so much water as usual. Can‚Äôt wait to get back to working outü§£ I‚Äôm also mad for vitamins and supplements! Everyone kept saying how fast my initial swelling and bruising went down by the time I had left. I can definitely see still quite a bit of swelling front on when I‚Äôm really analysing (finding the jaw the worst at the moment) but wearing the chin strap and taping my nose at night time has really been helping.
</p>
<p>
Hope your just as pleased with your resultsü•∞

I will be able to go back to training next week. Time flies!

I guess it&#39;s really in genes as I&#39;m also into healthy diet, supplements and sport. But from the beginning I was swollen more than most girls, doctors told me that a lot...
</p>
<p>
I still wearing a chin strap, but what about tapping your nose?
</p>
<p>
In our group of girls pineapple juice got really popular as a supplement to help with swelling. In few local shops around the world owners are wondering, why their stock of pineapple juice got empty üòÑ

So you just use micropore tape and place is strategically over your nose, it stops there being a build up of swelling overnight and it really works! If you google it tons of videos will come up.

Thank you‚ò∫Ô∏è It‚Äôs was really a combination of my wants and needs and their recommendations.
</p>
<p>
Their forehead work speaks for itself and I didn‚Äôt really have any direction for them with that. The surgeon was extremely informative about how he was going to be aggressive with reconstruction and barring as I had a heavier brow before. I was pretty direct in the fact that I wanted a significant brow lift and definitely wanted the hooks placed.
</p>
<p>
I would say I was the most direct about my nose which I think is the most important to be in this case. I made sure to say I did not want a completely straight nose from the side, I wanted a raised and pinched tip and I didn‚Äôt mind if it looked slightly done.
</p>
<p>
I was direct about my chin also, telling them I didn‚Äôt want a round chin. I wanted more of a V line approach to keep the bottom third of my face striking just more feminine! And the jaw is pretty much based on your anatomical restrictions and where is the safe place to stop.
</p>
<p>
Altogether I would say that my concern going into it was conservative results but I‚Äôm a pretty direct person and state what I want. However I was pleased to see the surgeons take a pretty good initiative to addressing the issues I needed fixed, with a little guidance on what I wanted!
</p>
<p>
I also think it‚Äôs a very personal thing your result and unfortunately has a lot to do with your pre op face somewhat and is maybe why some people would prefer extremely aggressive surgeons, I think safety is paramount though!

Great results. Would they post your results on their websites? I think a lot of people say FT doesn&#39;t produce dramatic results because a lot of their patients just move on after the op. I&#39;m happy for you! üòä

I think if you go back to Spain once you are fully recovered the take your pictures and post them on the website. I‚Äôm not 100% on that though, I‚Äôm still not totally sure about sharing my before and after. But that may change in the future it‚Äôs all still kind of fresh, I‚Äôm so happy with my results though and happy for them to go everywhere and anywhere haha! Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è

I&#39;m booked in for a Chin reduction with facial team in a few months. I was just wondering, how do they decide how much to reduce your chin height by?

Thank you! So they do a pre op CT scan which they then use for a template to determine where to remove the bone. This way the can safely remove the bone without disrupting the soft tissues surrounding it, paired with their ultrasonic tools makes for an easier recovery and less risk of complication!

For the total cost of the surgery, materials and hospitals fees I paid just over 30k euro. Then on top of that I paid for accommodation out with la villa Marbella and flights etc. My quote is from earlier this year and I know they change their prices regularly so don‚Äôt want to give you a complete breakdown. Consults are free however and they will give you a personalised quote!

WOW, you look amazing! Congrats!!
</p>
<p>
I have my surgery with Facial Team booked for early next year, can&#39;t wait!!
</p>
<p>
During my consultation with Dr. Simon I was told that Chin/Jaw is Dr. Simon&#39;s expertise and Type 3 forehead + orbital barring + brow lift is Dr. Luis Capit√°n&#39;s. Did you have to request a different surgeon for the forehead work or it was randomly assigned? Were you told during the consultation who the surgeons will be for each procedure?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve never heard about Dr Miguel Juli√° Mart√≠nez but I can already see that his work is excellent!
</p>
<p>
Thank you in advance!

Thank you so much‚ù§Ô∏è How exciting!! It‚Äôs going to be an amazing experience for youü•∞
</p>
<p>
Yeah that‚Äôs right they both specialise in those procedures, I had my consultation with Dr Bellinga initially and I knew he was the nose surgeon but I wasn‚Äôt completely sure on who was doing my surgery until my pre op consult.
</p>
<p>
Dr Bellinga done my rhinoplasty and Dr Juli√° performed the rest of my FFS! Honestly I‚Äôm so pleased with both their skills hands down!
</p>
<p>
There was another girl getting surgery the same day as me and my surgery took up the entire day like 9 hours under the knife so I would assume Simon and/or Capitan was involved in her surgery.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Dr Juli√° sat down and started speaking to me I knew I was in amazing hands! We were completely on the same page with everything.
</p>
<p>
Any questions you might have I‚Äôm happy to answer‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you so much for such a detailed response! ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve heard so many great things about Facial Team&#39;s work and the overall experience that I had to book with them!  I had two consultations with Dr. Simon and he&#39;s been so patient, professional and answered all my questions even if they were silly or duplicates from the first consultation :)
</p>
<p>
I do have couple of questions if you have a moment:
</p>
<p>
Did you go alone or you had someone with you to support you and care for you during the recovery? I know they provide with a nurse on daily basis to cleanup, etc. but I wonder if it&#39;s smart to go alone?
</p>
<p>
How bad is the recovery? More specifically, do you think I&#39;ll be able to work ( on my laptop remotely) during the recovery time or I should take full 2 weeks time off from work?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m from US and here most surgeons will prescribe narcotic based pain killers (Oxycodone). When it comes to Europe, I&#39;ve heard that rules are more strict and I wonder if I should ask my primary care doctor in US to provide me with prescription of narcotic based pain killers so I can take with me or Facial Team is able to handle that? If so, are their pain killers strong enough and similar to the ones in US? I&#39;m just not so great when it comes to pain and even for simple dental cleaning I request lidocaine injections prior the cleaning :)
</p>
<p>
Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Very few people have much pain at facial team due to their using ultrasonic bone cutting tools. I have heard of them providing stronger pain killers but it‚Äôs very rarely needed.

Congratulations!  I am simply amazed. You look so pretty and feminine. I&#39;m astounded that I see no surgical scaring along your hairline what so ever, in just a few weeks. I&#39;ve seen others that leave me really concerned...
</p>
<p>
Like yourself, my profile is VERY dysphoric for me. I caught a glimpse of a  picture over the weekend and it instantly twisted me up inside. I&#39;m in the early stages of choosing whom to do my FFS.  I want all of the procedures as you had. I&#39;m curious as to how you arrived at the decision of what to have done and by whom. FacialTeam is an obviously choice but did you look into others?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m from the US and I&#39;m trying to get a sense of the travel costs to stay in Spain. Can you provide some ballpark of the non-surgical costs and how long that you had to be there?
</p>
<p>
One last question I like to ask has to do with when you look in the mirror now. For me, every time I see my image, there is this jolt of dysphoria that often sucker punches me. A friend that had FFS told me afterwards, that she was shocked to discover just how much energy that she used to devote to this mental gymnastics before FFS that simple vanished afterwards. She no longer has to guard herself looking in the mirror. Have you noticed anything similar for you?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for sharing your experience. You certainly inspire me to move forward with FFS.
