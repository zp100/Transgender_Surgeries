I think it would be a good idea if you linked all your posts together, or added an index on one of them and linked to that each time. i.e here&#39;s the last one,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/vz59x9/day_40_dr_sutin_pai_bangkok_thailand_added/" rel="nofollow">Day 40
</a>
.

I&#39;m not entirely sure how to do all of that but that would be a good idea I only started posting this like this because I wanted to have other trans women see what the healing process is and how my recovery is going so that they can gauge their recovery should they decide to choose the doctor that I used or at least have a general idea of what to expect when they are healing despite the fact that we all heal differently at least they can use it to also compare when I was looking for doctors I couldn&#39;t find any type of research like this which is why I decided to post every few days so that other people can find the research that I was looking for so I humbly put myself out there with my vagina so that hopefully others who don&#39;t know can also be educated but I&#39;m not entirely sure how to index it is this something you can explain?
