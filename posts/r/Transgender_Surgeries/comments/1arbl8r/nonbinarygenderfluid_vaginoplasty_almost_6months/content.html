Honestly considering you are not the first high BMI individual to get this surgery thanks to Dr. Ramineni, it just goes to show BMI gatekeeping is absolute bs.

Right?  Like I even had less dehiscence than a lot of other people and I was self reliant right away.
</p>
<p>
I am built a bit different, but yeah the gatekeeping isn&#39;t based in merit.

It‚Äôs more about the anesthesia tbh and it isn‚Äôt BS. Good on the surgeon and anesthesiologist for taking on the liability though

People with BMI go through a ton of medical necessary surgeries every year without dying, those surgeries arent gatekept cuz the risks are so minor and the benefits are enormous.
</p>
<p>
Only reason bottom surgery is gatekept by some surgeons is the fact it is still seen as cosmetic surgery.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
Though tbh, even if surgeons dropped BMI requirements you would still want to go to Dr. Ramineni because he has something most other surgeons dont, experience with high bmi patients which is incredibly valuable, since many surgeons are not confident at all when it comes to us because of their lack of experience.

It‚Äôs not the anesthesia. My bmi wasn‚Äôt even a concern for ffs despite being under 8 hours. It‚Äôs not an issue for BA. But if I want bottom surgery they want me to weight. Not sure what I want down there so it‚Äôs not an issue yet, but it‚Äôs definitely concerning.

Right? People will litterally make up any excuse to back medical fatphobia.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s almost like they forget they&#39;re 600lb patients going through bariatric surgery which is far riskier.
</p>
<p>
Cover my weight and my pre labs would have you believe I was someone half my weight üôÑ

From what I was told, the biggest issue if the feet holdy things and that&#39;s it.
</p>
<p>
Also they don&#39;t take on liability that&#39;s why they have waivers so unless they are completely negligent I assume the risks of surgery.
</p>
<p>
Also there is a reason why they do pre labs you know, mine were awesome.

Hopefully not weird to say, but: thank you for posting over the last few months. I am on the high BMI side as well and seeing someone around my size going through surgery helped me finalize the decision to go forward with Dr Ramineni (who i&#39;m seeing in early March. ~3 weeks. crazy!).
</p>
<p>
I mean there are definitely other factors involved too (financial, insurance, letters, etc), but I&#39;ve been holding off for almost a decade for surgery due to weight - my lowest was around 33-34 BMI, or around 260lbs with my height, which was *still* too high for most surgeons at the time.
</p>
<p>
So... anyway. thanks again.
</p>
<p>
A question (or two?) if you&#39;re okay with it.  Have you had any issues with hair inside that you can tell? Do you have to use lube for sex/solo time?

Hell yeah! So close üòÅ
</p>
<p>
You are very welcome. Us bigger people deserve self love and acceptance as well which is why I post ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
</p>
<p>
I havnt noticed any hairs inside my canal. He&#39;s really good about his folicule scrape.
</p>
<p>
I do have a few strays that are inside my labia but that&#39;s alright, I&#39;ll get those zapped soon. I didn&#39;t do any removal at all so I&#39;m happy with that side of things.
</p>
<p>
I havnt done much of anything yet, as I&#39;m mostly waiting on that trouble spot, but the few times I have yes I used lube üòÖ It is slightly annoying that i have to remind people but who knows maybe I don&#39;t have to, I&#39;ll save that experiment for a bit further down the road.

From what i understand, the follicle scrapping happens to the scrotal skin once its removed which makes the interior of the canal, there&#39;s no scraping in other areas hence it is quite normal for some hair to still be around the labia.
</p>
<p>
Kind of an off topic question, but since i get the feeling body size makes things a bit different compared to smaller patients, how quickly did you size up in dilators? I got the soulsource set a few weeks ago and the smallest one is tiny lol

Size only really effect rate of healing. Maybe
</p>
<p>
If I didn&#39;t have that nasty fourchette separation I would have been pretty on schedule.
</p>
<p>
Now if you had diabetes that would potentionally be a different story, but even then, the core area gets great blood circulation so even then...
</p>
<p>
There was no impact on sizing up. Got to orange by week 4-5

I was more thinking about body size in general, if someone is rly thin it might be harder to fit the bigger dilators inside easily compared to someone bigger with more &#34;space&#34; xd
</p>
<p>
Which one did you start with and how soon did you get to the next one. Getting to orange by week 4-5 definitely feels quite fast but if it is easy, did you stay at a specific size for a while?

Still no impact. The surgeon in question (and Ramineni does) should be testing the largest dilator while making the canal.
</p>
<p>
Unless you mean depth then height could have a impact though mostly in instances like with a sigmoid canal were up to 11inches is doable (I know a few) and even then they weren&#39;t very tall.
</p>
<p>
I took a integrative approach to sizing up so in the 5th week it was being introduced. Where as the week before Green was introduced and is now around halfway comfortable.

Yep same thing, been looking for this surgery for around a decade only to be blocked by outdated BMI standards, thankfully thanks to post like these I was able to find this surgeon and got the surgery scheduled for this May

I&#39;m so so glad you were able to finally be able to take the steps to get to a more self loving you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry it took so long and am deeply humbled that my journey was able to have such an impact ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
</p>
<p>
As I&#39;ve said before, us bigger folx deserve the chance to experience that same bump in self love as our lower BMI counterparts.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully everything goes perfect, but regardless this chance is truly a gift ü§ó
