Hey,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a European so I can&#39;t use fancy American health insurance which means I&#39;m stuck with second rate international surgeons. I want someone who will radically change my face and safety is a secondary concern because my backup plan is to eat a bullet. If I get nerve damage I don&#39;t care. If I look like a plastic doll I don&#39;t care. As long as I survive and don&#39;t go blind I could care less what else happens provided I don&#39;t look anything like this any more.
</p>
<p>
I consulted with Facial Team but
<em>
hated
</em>
their simulation. I was just about to put down a deposit with Dr Rossi in Argentina but then I read a slew of negativity about how he&#39;s super conservative now and doesn&#39;t do very much. So back to the drawing board I guess?
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t want to spend more than $50,000. Please help me decide what to do this is killing me; I just want this to be over.
</p>
<p>
Any suggestions greatly appreciated, thank you.
</p>

You could try getting a consult with Quentin Qassemyar and see what you think. His consults are free of charge

Rossi has always given pretty good consistent results. His bone work is A-1 even on heavy masculinized faces. There&#39;s actually surgeons out there that charge just as much for mosquito bite results. Do your research.

Facial team Brazil is the best. For many Facial Teams dr Thiago Tenório work better than Facial Team Spain. Though his work is subtle and he doesnt make the doll look so much as Dr Lucas Patrocinio in Uberlândia-MG Brazil who is known for his agressive changes. Fronto+rhino+mentoplaty with Dr Patrocinio was around BRL 65k last year. He posts some immediate results in his instagram @lucaspatrocinio and @feminizacaobrasil. Hes seriously a game changer for your face, and you probably will get a cloudy vision for the fist month but then it will be gone. I had mine with him few months ago, really worth the money.

I went to Rossi and he did an amazing job on me, pretty cheap and aggresive results I love, no problems so far

So the thing about those simulations is that they never reflect what your healed results will look like. My surgeon doesn’t even use them because they’re not useful or reliable indicators of your results. Honestly they just end up making us feel worse about how we look now or how we’ll look after surgery.

There’s sluzky if you’re interested check the facemaker instagram, she’s also got a patient group chat if you’re interested. I think she specialises in browbone reduction:)
