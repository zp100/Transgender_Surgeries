Please explain how this picture fits into the overall experience you describe with the post-surgery swelling. It this before or after they went in to fix things? Where do you stand now and what suggestions did Dr. Ting provide to help you through the altered recovery?
</p>
<p>
This is a great way for others who may face variations of this problem.

The picture was taken yesterday, I will see if I have pictures of how it looked before. Dr. Ting just said keep dilating, and let everything close up. Once everything closes and the swelling goes down (5 or 6 months) then we’ll decide if I need a revision. The hardest part about everything is the soreness of the open wounds. It’s not really painful just so uncomfortable.

Oh, I&#39;ve been there, I know exactly how it feels. Did he prepare you for the extended recovery time? Healing through second intention can turn into a really awful experience. There&#39;s no guarantee that it will be terrible, but you should be aware of the road map of possibilities.

I spoke with my doctor and he said it’s common and to just keep moist gauze on it twice a day. I see him this week for a follow up. Thank your for the concern!

Thank you! Trust me I have days where I cry because it doesn’t look how I wanted it to. But I’m trying to stay positive, and if I do have to go back it will be for cosmetic revision not anything internal which makes me feel a little better.

I am a few week after GRS with bank; but my vagina has never ever looked like that. It seems very sore and having complication. Well if your doctor thinks happy and all good then is good, I was shocked when I see your photo to be honest.

Yeah it’s pretty shocking. Because of all the complications I had early on, I’m just trying to stay positive and see how everything heals. Congrats on your surge.

I just had my consult with him two weeks ago. What are you thoughts of Ting and the team?

Hey, thanks. I think ting and his team are great, I’ve had nothing but really good experiences with them. I am mostly in contact with the his fellow more than him, but she is responsive and helpful too. Everyone on the team though is encouraging and kind.

Thanks for the feedback! That&#39;s wonderful to hear. I didn&#39;t get to meet the fellow but my friends did the following week at their consult.

I had some wound dishiscence pretty early on too. I ended up needing a labiaplasty (among other things) but if your depth is still okay then hopefully things just patch up from here.  Good luck sis!

Thank you for sharing. Though it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s gold for others to know about others to feel educated about potential complications or others that get complications so they can read about it. If you want your post to figure on the wiki, you can tag the user called HiddenStill.

Dr Jess “The Butcher” Ting is at it again! I’m a former patient/victim of his. Thankfully I didn’t get this bad or get any infections but he gave me piss poor results back in 2017 with shitty follow up service
