I’ll post an album and report once I have figured out imgur again.
</p>
<p>
wow holy fuck my mental health was terrible that first week or two. Thank goodness I am feeling better now.
</p>
<p>
I’m mostly happy with my results, and I am glad I went through with the surgery. Deleon nailed the aesthetic I wanted. Have masturbated but have only come to the edge of orgasming, I think the anti-depressants are inhibiting that. Only two complications have been 1) a tear/wound separation along my right labia majora near the vaginal opening, and 2) less depth than expected, like 3 inches at most. I was smol down there beforehand. The doctors have told me the tear will heal on its own, and the lack of depth is less impactful as I am a lesbian.
</p>
<p>
I was afraid dilation was going to be horrible, but tbh it’s been fine. I lube up my purple dilator, I watch old Among Us videos, and I douche it out with warm distilled water and soap.
</p>
<p>
I’m REALLY euphoric looking down and realizing what parts I have down there. Like I have what I’ve always wanted since I was a teenager! 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹

This is so exciting! You look like you&#39;re healing really well, especially considering you&#39;ve had minor complications. Congrats!

Hey, you look great! Do you douche on bed or in the shower? I usually do this in the shower, but Im having a light to medium discharge that my Doc says is the lub. I tried to do this at bed today, after dilate and I struggled:(

Looking great! Thanks for the motivation. Had surgery with Dr Min Jun of the Crane Center in San Francisco 10 days ago and it’s definitely been rough. Every day is better but recovery is so hard for this surgery. Especially in cold months. I definitely did not consider weather patterns for recovery.

OMG! Im brazilian and I live ib São Paulo, 18 days post op and I can say that is too hard to afford dilation and douche 3 X a day in these cold days (12~15°C), I really cant imagine how it is for people who live in colder places 😵‍💫

The funny thing is it’s 14 Celsius here. It’s not even that cold. It’s just so vulnerable feeling after surgery.

I got it! I was talking about this with a friend that have surgery with my doctor just one week after me. Sometimes the blues get us so hard! Maybe because of the hormones or the fact that we cant go anywhere... idk, feels kinda lonely sometimes 🥺

I’m going to DeLeon in April of next year. Thank you for sharing! Not enough people share their results from her. How was the overall experience? How long did you have to stay in TX? Just wondering how long I have to get a rental for. Thanks again for sharing

I’m healed up well, I have pretty good sensation. Don’t have any more depth than I started with. I’ll have to upload new pictures, it’s been 9 months.
