Definitely need to spread as much as possible. Even with most people knowing about Rumer and her history of mutilating people, I still see people occasionally asking about her and if she’s good. That’s proof that you can never tell your story too much and there’s always people that it doesn’t reach.

I think the best things we can all do is make people aware of the need to research and point them in the right direction.
</p>
<p>
This sub is already the largest trans surgery resource on internet and it’s growing at a rapid rate. I hope it will become so well known that essentially everyone one knows to come here, and that will have an influence on our care. It’s the only thing that will.

You can do it on reddit too, just make your own user feed. Now that you can add galleries on reddit it&#39;s even easier.

The thing is you really need to engage with the community here while you&#39;re telling your story. Let people interact with your experience so the same problems don&#39;t happen to them, and you don&#39;t end up sounding like chicken little.

The sad reality is that Spiegel and people like him have had warnings about their shoddy work for years. Rumer has had people warning of her butchery for what seems like forever. Yet girls still go to her and have their lives destroyed by her in spite of the published warnings. I simply don&#39;t know what the answer is. If the AMA won&#39;t police these people, it&#39;s everyone for themselves, I suppose. It&#39;s just a sad state of affairs.

The FFS Facebook group is sort of filled with some stuck up people. I got called southern tranny trailer trash, got accused of spreading misinformation since I “work for a surgeon”, and kicked out. I’ve also been told that some others have been getting bullied and booted as well. So much for a nontoxic safe environment to share surgical results and learn from each other.

Some people there were very helpful and knowledgeable, but there seemed to be an influx of more negativity there over the last few months. I tend to think that trans people understand what each other go through and are sympathetic to each individual’s experiences. But I also forget that there are just some really shitty humans out there regardless of the “group” they belong to.

Unfortunately, the bad seemed to out way the good. There are/were some some knowledgeable people there, but unfortunately it seemed to have turned into a high school level bullying group.

Some people are limited by the type of insurance they have. They may get a list of 2 or three Dr&#39;s to choose from in a selected geographic area or a single state. No one wants to go into surgery believing they will be disappointed in the end. Like everything else in life, It takes resources to increase the probability of a better outcome.

Agreed, he probably did meticulous work on the high profile people and then for everyone else shrugged his shoulders and said to the apprentices “they get what they get” I’m so sorry that happened to you btw, I hope you get the Justice you deserve 😞
