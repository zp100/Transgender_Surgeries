Careful with the &#34;even better result
</p>
<p>
I was worried better options would appear but I must say even with ppt available now, what I got from suporn matches that. Besides it would probably not hurt to see how it turns out anyway.
</p>
<p>
... Actually no, it will hurt. But you pay probably as much.

Weird, they confirmed multiple times by email for me. I can forward you the emails to show them if you like?

Let me ask them again. They previously refused to do it base on their reasons, including lesbians also need vigina to play with sex.
</p>
<p>
Recently, they had some administrative changes and I was very upset about it. They first asked for my referall letter though I sent them 6 months ago. Then they said such referral letter was not sufficient only less than 2 from the surgery date, even though they confirmed it was ok when I sent them. I was very angry with them and they finally apologized and said everything was ok for documentation. I worried about the efficiency of the communication with the administrative staffs, but at least I have the chance to bring the minimal depth topic up directly with the doctor in the consultantion session right before the surgery.

I chose to receive SRS mainly just for changing my ID and live easier. I live in a country where gender on IDs can only be changed after SRS. Life would be difficult without my ID changed in this relatively conservative country. I don&#39;t plan to marry and I am not interested in sex. I even don&#39;t think it is practical to find any partner, as in my country there are many parents interfering with the freedom of marriage of their children and many men think the main purpose to have a wife is to give birth to a boy to carry on the family name. In addition, I think I&#39;m asexual and still don&#39;t know if I&#39;m attracted to men or women and I don&#39;t have a desire to have sex. Also, I&#39;m of Asian race and after prior surgeries I have formed hypertrophic scars that are not easy to disappear on their own. I also had a keloid (the kind of scar tissue constantly growing in size outside the original boundary of the wound) on my back, not knowing how it developed, but I had it removed in a surgery and received radiation treatment to avoid it from growing again. That&#39;s the medical reason why I wanted to avoid dilation and a full-depth vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
I thought of immigration to a country where ID can be changed without SRS but gave up this idea because it will be difficult to find a job and I don&#39;t want to leave my old parents as I&#39;m their only child. There is no best choice for me but full of compromises to make.

Tbh, if you read his paper, it’s more than obvious that this decision to not make minimal depth surgeries comes out of his own “beliefs”. I say that especially because labia are the first thing that is done, and then, with the remaining skin, he does the vaginal canal… so he could perfectly cut it and do minimal depth without any issues… of course, adapting the rest of the protocol could require an effort (dilation, staff training and other stuff), but I mean, why not?
