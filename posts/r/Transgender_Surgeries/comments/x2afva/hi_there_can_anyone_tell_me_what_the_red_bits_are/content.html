Looks like granulation. If it persists it can be treated with silver nitrate by a nurse. X

You look like youre healing well! It took me a while for my swelling to go down and for my vagina to start actually looking like a vagina and not a surgery site. Hang in there and try not to fret! you&#39;re going to heal beautifully. :)

Granulation? You might ask your doctor about corticosteroid cream or silver nitrate.

I had this around my vulva and confirmed with my MD and the Surgeon that it is not granulation and just a normal part of healing.  I was very worried for a couple of weeks but now it is not noticeable.  My surgery was April 5, 2022.  Good luck.

Itâ€™s normal to have granulation tissue which  is what that is, and if you want to speed up the healing I would put medihoney on it and it will heal right up! You look great btw!

Quick look at their website says it&#39;s an &#39;antibacterial wound gel&#39; with &#39;80%
<strong>
medical grade
</strong>
honey&#39;. Even though honey has
<em>
some
</em>
antifungal/bacterial properties it&#39;s basically just herbal medicine with extra steps.
</p>
<p>
If it is granulation as the other commenter suggested a bit of silver nitrate will easily get rid of it

I was REALLY upset about my results for months! Now, after a year, it looks alright. I&#39;m going back in to get a revision done near the end of the year for aesthetics. But the state of my vagina for something like 8 months was questionable at BEST! A lot of me asking myself if I made the right choice.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the red is likely granulation tissue, blood from dilation, etc. If you&#39;re local to your doctor, they can assess. But things look pretty good considering how recent you had this done!

You don&#39;t have to worry. This is normal. The wound is still in the healing process and it will gradually get smaller and less swollen. When it has fully healed, it will definitely look good. You have to wait for a while.
