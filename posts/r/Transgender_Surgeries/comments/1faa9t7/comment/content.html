DISCLAIMER: I&#39;m on a lot of good drugs so please be gentle if I come off as offensive somehow!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll edit my post with updates as I go. Pics if my trans surgery family wants to see em.
</p>
<p>
This is going to be a lot of detail so you are forewarned and forarmed before you go through this experience yourself.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Surgery started almost an hour late due to OR prep time. I&#39;d rather they clean it very thoroughly after the morning surgery so meh, NBD. I&#39;m gonna be here for a while what do I care exactly when surgery starts?
</li>
<li>
both surgeons came in and quickly talked to me before surgery. They&#39;re in a rush, I didn&#39;t have any questions, I had asked them all at my pre-op interview, like &#34;can I please have pretty full labia AND depth?&#34; Dr Bowers said don&#39;t worry sweety your vagina is going to be gorgeous. She clarified straight away that this is going to be within reason, AMAB people only have so much skin to work with she can&#39;t give you very long labia. We&#39;ll see if I agree with her once I&#39;m all healed up. I&#39;m betting I&#39;m just going to be so happy I don&#39;t have to see a penis and testis getting out of the shower I won&#39;t mind if they&#39;re not long glorious labia. Anyone want to take bets? üòÇ
</li>
<li>
I was
<strong>
so
</strong>
<strong>
SO
</strong>
hungry. all clear liquid diet the day before had me like üò©. I won&#39;t tell you about bowel prep the day before, just... Don&#39;t plan any meetings on bowel prep day, t
<strong>
rust me
</strong>
</li>
<li>
Ask  your surgeon if it&#39;s OK to clear the area by trimming or shaving a couple days before. I shaved the night before then did the anti-bacterial prep in the morning before I left home and it was so freaking painful. It burned and burned and burned, especially on my perineum where I should have used more shaving cream. üò≠üò≠üò≠ it was like 5/10 painful, it was AWFUL and burned for hours. Do everything you can within surgeons orders to avoid treating broken/irritated skin with those anti-bacterial wipes!
</li>
<li>
My PIV line going in
<strong>
burned
</strong>
and was 4/10 painful until I went into surgery which took a while. I&#39;ve had PIV lines before, they don&#39;t have to hurt this bad :/
</li>
<li>
All nurses/doctors/staff have been super nice and kind, only 2 out of probably 15 people that have talked to me have mid-gendered me (one of them twice and was very apologetic when I corrected her sternly the second time). I do not pass, but, my legal gender is female, my pronouns are written on my board, and, they have my freaking chart so be better people, I&#39;m here for a gender affirming VAGINOPLASTY for f&#39;s sake!! OK OK getting off my soap box...
</li>
<li>
The nurses have all been really responsive and given me good drugs whenever I&#39;ve asked (I&#39;m white so ya know, sadly my black and brown family may have a different experience, I hope not). The only nurse I asked for permission to use their name was Brenden, he&#39;s a
<em>
joy
</em>
to work with. So good at is job, amazing bedside manner, friendly, joined in the conversation for a minute that my wife and friend and I were having about spiders üòÇ so easy to talk to, was really considerate when my wife was sleeping in the room and was really quiet and kept the lights down, I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better nurse.
</li>
<li>
I had a private pre-op and now have a private room that&#39;s QUIET. Super thick door I can&#39;t hear anyone talk outside so I may actually be able to get some sleep I&#39;m super sensitive to sound - so SO privileged to have good insurance and a tech job to be able to have this luxury of a nice room not to mention getting Gender Affirming Care to begin with!
</li>
<li>
bed is really nice, upper half/lower half controls on both sides on the railing where it&#39;s super convenient to reach along with nurse call button and every time I adjust a decent amount the mattress does this gentle inflation side to side action. Fancy!
</li>
<li>
I am vegetarian so picked the tofu with mixed vegetables for dinner with a brownie for dessert and it wasn&#39;t terrible! That&#39;s not fair, it was good actually, I&#39;d be happy spending $10-$15 for it at a restaurant.
</li>
<li>
prepare your loved ones. You may be a really
<strong>
really
</strong>
chatty, loopy, say-anything weirdo on the pain meds/coming out of anesthesia. You might say some things you regret, you might propose to your SO which hopefully you don&#39;t regret üòÇ, you will have basically NO filter so prepare anyone who is accompanying you! This is not an open invitation or excuse to be an asshole mind you you&#39;ll still have a LITTLE self control just not a lot üòÅ

With all the negative reviews of Bowers what convinced you to choose her as your surgeon?

Her expertise, how many surgeries she&#39;s done, the results documented on her website, how she treated me at my first meeting, how nice and welcoming her office staff are, her proximity to me as I live in the area, she does follical slicing and surgical electrolysis for hair removal so I didn&#39;t have to wait years to fully clear the area, she takes my insurance, ¬†the fact that she does PIV because I have a hernia repair with abdominal mesh so I&#39;m not a candidate for PPT.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s done 2,500+ surgeries. Not all of her patients are going to be completely satisfied with her work.
</p>
<p>
After I chose her I learned more that made me happy about my choice: She&#39;s updated her technique to use more of the foreskin (if you have one) for the labia minora to give you pink inner labia, her patients typically get really good depth.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day I found her to be very trustworthy. I like to think I&#39;m a decent judge of character, I believe that she really cares about her patients.

Oh and also, she has a very low revision rate. She&#39;s done less than 200 revisions after 2,500 surgeries

Sounds great. I feel Dr Bower&#39;s would be great certainly having personal thoughts for her patients. Hope it all goes great for you.
</p>
<p>
Love you comment about not seeing a penis or testicals. let me assure you that is the greatest thing ever. It is not even so much about having a vagina it is all about not having that other shit there. Everyday life is so much easier, everything is just comfortable. Oh and as your body grows into your vagina it is even better. I have a boyfriend and that part is amazing.
</p>
<p>
Sit back and recover/heal as your body feels, don&#39;t rush it as you have the rest of your life to live with a vagina and let me tell you it just feels normal and natural and you don&#39;t really think about it

Dr. Bowers did my wife fantastic, Dr. Gunther is better to talk to for follow-up stuff tbh, I&#39;m sure you got a taste of how good his bedside manner and people skills are.

Hi! Now that you‚Äôre near a hundred days out, would your review have changed at all? I‚Äôm supposed to get my surgery with Dr. Gunther near the end of January and I‚Äôm a bit anxious üòÖ. Also if you‚Äôre still comfortable with it I‚Äôd be really curious to see pictures. Feel free to dm me ‚ò∫Ô∏è

More on Marci Bowers. Presumably they are somewhat similar.

Some nurses wouldn&#39;t give me pain meds on a regular schedule, they wanted me to be in pain before they&#39;d give me anything. Other nurses would give me the meds every four hours to keep me medicated and not feeling the worst of the pain
</p>
<p>
Dr Bowers bedside manner is to be pretty brisk and to the point Dr Gunther is very warm and has a bedside manner that I personally felt more at home with
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve seen both of them for my follow up care and neither of them are perfect but they&#39;ve taken good care of me. They give all their patients their personal phone numbers so you can SMS iMessage them which is great but they don&#39;t give you any notice if they&#39;re out of the country or unavailable so you have to stay on top of getting them to answer ¬†question or provide advice.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m pretty happy with my results, I am still treating granulation but at my most recent appointment Dr Gunther said I have one or two more granulation treatment visits then I should be done.
