My pic has been auto-set to NSFW so hope you can see it!? (I’m supposed to be able to modify the setting but can’t seem to find where to do that....)

My facial transition in six images was quite a challenge!😅 So, start bottom right (obviously!) and work to bottom left - that’s the 2014 surgery. Then top row, top right to top left - 2019 chin and jaw surgery.

Yep. Makes sense haha! It’s tricky, isn’t it? Many ways to put together Tatami or flow a sequence of things into a grid.
</p>
<p>
I’m thinking that if if/when I have any images to share that if it’s more than two or three, to number them in the corner.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how was the swelling in your jaw? Your final result is just radiant! You are clearly so happy, I can see it just in your eyes alone!

Yes, all good thanks - the 2019 Kamol surgery was in June so I was well healed by late 2019.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad the change in my overall psychological state and personality shows through. The shadow, anxiety and negativity that followed me from aged 2.5 until transition just all went immediately I decided to press the button😊

I had a great experience at Kamol. I was on my own and went for three weeks and stayed the whole time at the hospital. Great facilities and nice location. A lovely small shopping centre a few minutes walk away with good supermarket, Boots chemist and restaurants/coffee shop. Wish I’d stayed another week in Thailand and visited the coast but I did need the two and a half weeks post-surgery for the bruising and swelling to subside.

I just had chin and jaw done with Facial Team in 2020 before COVID.  They revamped their surgery methods completely since 2018.  They now use a 3D model to make plastic guides that are inserted into the jaw during surgery to guide the cuts.  This means they can make a more refined jaw with less risk to nerves.  They don&#39;t cut the chin and re attach they just go in and make the cuts to taper it and reduce length. The cuts to the mandible are much more aggressive than prior to 2018 when they used the old method.  I am extremely happy with the result.  Even without lower face lift I can see a big improvement but as they advised a face lift will show off the result better.  You look amazing by the way.

Thanks Dana and am pleased you’re happy😊 That’s really interesting as I had someone in the surgery group asking me about their techniques and I said I couldn’t really comment as I know they’re always improving and was sure they’d probably moved on since 2014. Their bone work seems to have always been their speciality. Yes, they’ve always advised on waiting six months or so for facelift after jaw for optimum result. When Kamol did my jaw and chin I actually gambled and had a lower facelift at same time and they were quite aggressive so the result has been absolutely fine 18 months on - even having lost quite a bit of weight in my face this year as a result of my dieting and which I was initially a bit concerned about but it’s been fine.😊

😊I’m a bit out of touch with them now except for some occasional social exchanges but they have always sought to constantly improve and I think are still using the great HC (Highcare) hospital out near Puerto Banus. It’s a lovely, friendly team and I enjoyed the whole experience. You’ll typically be in hospital for at least one night and possibly two and have the ice mask on most of night one. The only thing I’d say is just try and be as fit and healthy as you can be between now and then as that will give your body the best chance to heal.

Firstly, congratulations that&#39;s a massive change! You look absolutely stunning! So good!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, and not directed to you, but why do some people post photos backwards (right-left instead of left-right)? It took me a bit to realise at first that the most recent photo was on the left, not the right. Well that and reading the headline again and reading &#34;FFS&#34;. 😂 (maybe it took a little bit longer than normal cause I&#39;ve just woken up too 😂)

I remember the morning of the first op and it was a massive mix of elation and apprehension and a distinct sense of passing the point of no return - but I had absolutely no intention of returning and couldn’t leave it all behind fast enough!

Hi - really sorry to hear that but I’ve heard the same comment about FT before. They didn’t actually do any lower third for me as they said I didn’t need any but I always rather regretted it afterwards and finally had it done five years later at Kamol. Yes, so, at Kamol it was jaw shave, chin, neck/lower facelift and lip lift. I have a global figure for the trip in my head and can’t quite remember the nett cost for surgery after travel and accom but I think it was in the region of GBP 11k.

It was really because I wanted to try Kamol as I liked their aesthetic and the need for a more ‘aggressive’ approach to doing the facelift at same time as jaw shave and chin rather than having to wait six months. That was a calculated gamble but which worked well, for me at least, as after 18 months and losing weight there’s been no issue with sagging etc. Facialteam did a great job on my brow ridge, forehead and opening up the eye area plus nose😊
