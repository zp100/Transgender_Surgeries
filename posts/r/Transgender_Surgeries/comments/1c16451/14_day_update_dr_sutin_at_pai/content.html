Congratulations. You are awesome.

I have mine scheduled a month from now with him. I would love to hear any tips or advice you have to prepare myself.

Bring someone. Please do by all means, and have them install Google Translate. The first 4 days in the hospital are easily the worst and the nurses don‚Äôt speak English. Having an advocate who can communicate will be critical. If you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôll make it through, but make sure you‚Äôve got a support system at home to call and video chat, it‚Äôs gonna help a lot mentally
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs a rough first week, but it will get better day by day. Then it‚Äôll get a little bit worse when you start dilation, but it‚Äôll just keep improving. Don‚Äôt feel afraid to yell at yourself that you‚Äôre being illogical for expecting to not be in pain barely a week post op. By 2 weeks you‚Äôre in much, much better shape. One day at a time.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of‚Ä¶ Count the days. Use that to remind yourself where you are and how much farther you have to go. It‚Äôs not forever, I promise
</p>
<p>
Bring a phone holder that clamps to a table so you don‚Äôt have to hold your phone up.
</p>
<p>
Bring a Roku, chromecast, set up box, whatever for in the hotel, you‚Äôre gonna be in the hotel room a lot and get very bored.
</p>
<p>
Download and set up Grab beforehand. It‚Äôs Uber and Ubereats combined, and everything is shockingly cheap (at least compared to in America)
</p>
<p>
You‚Äôre gonna have a moment of regret early on. Everyone has a ‚Äúwhat have I done‚Äù moment. I was in the hospital, they took the wrappings off and everything was hard, swollen, and numb. It felt like someone grafted a grapefruit between my legs. That WILL get better. I‚Äôm just saying that because it‚Äôs probably gonna happen and if I wasn‚Äôt aware of it beforehand I would‚Äôve been a basketcase.
</p>
<p>
Take your hormones the moment the doctor allows it, I had injections and it was such a relief and I think it really helped with my mind ‚Äúremapping itself and accepting that this vagina is a part of me.
</p>
<p>
Explore the city beforehand, the temples like Wat Pho and Wat Arun, the malls, etc

USD $9,300, plus flights, hotel, food outside of the hospital, etc. Probably about 12-13K in total

That‚Äôs the wonder of Thailand. Best doctors in the world and shockingly low prices, at least compared to America with a totally broken healthcare system that incentivizes massive prices because insurance will just pay for it anyway‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

<p>
Sorry what are we talking about?

I‚Äôve gotta give a ton of credit to Dr Sutin. The man is an artist and the most underrated SRS surgeon in Thailand, probably the world

No problem! Just remember that the first week is the hardest but every day is a little bit better (mostly. Dilation is hard to start out, but then it gets easier and easier again)
