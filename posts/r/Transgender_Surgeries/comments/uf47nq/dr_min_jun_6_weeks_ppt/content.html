Another week, another pic dump.
</p>
<p>
I caused some minor wound separation from exercise. You can see it viewer right on the upper side of my vestibule. It&#39;s stingy but I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s healing nicely.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m still really struggling with coming to terms with my results. Contrary to a lot of people, the more healing I do the worse I think my results look. For instance, the real total lack of definition between my majora and groin that causes it to be a flat plane is really uncanny looking to me.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, I think I might have been better off avoiding Srs in the first place. I underestimated my risk tolerance for bad aesthetic results.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ama.

Yea, same surgeon, same technique, similar results. If you look closely you can definitely see his trademark aesthetic.
</p>
<p>
However a couple of things made my case different than the norm: I didn&#39;t have much material to work owing to genital mutilation. And I he experimented using a single incision on me, instead of the normal two.
</p>
<p>
I think because of those factors, I have a vulva that lacks the detail found in most of Jun&#39;s work.

Yes. It appears there was lack of adequate tissue. Thank you for admitting genital mutilation. This allows viewers to understand the context of your situation &amp; results.

He did the best job and was well suited for the job.

For context, I do think Jun did a good job with what he had to work with. Surgeons can&#39;t magic more tissue into existence

Bootlicker? Im a patient of Dr. Jun’s and damn proud he did my surgery. There’s a lot of options in the Bay Area and no surgeon compared to his technique. Even the “legendary” surgeons. I couldnt have asked for a better surgeon and experience.

Lol! Unfortunately, I do not align with your opinion. Rather of fact I’m not about self-gaslighting. Which is a popular motif on this sub.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, I’m listening, validating, and being present with OP. They have shared a very intense experience. Which led to their unsatisfaction with results. Their results are GREAT, considering the context. Dr. Jun did great with minimal tissue.

Is it? I don&#39;t think that I magically get more definition over time. My experience has been that reducing swelling also reduces the apparent complexity and size of the features

I just want to say you look BEAUTIFUL down there hun.  I do think your results are what many would quantify as a younger looking vagina.  But older cis women will actually go in asking for their older sagging bits to be pruned to look more like this.
</p>
<p>
I really hope you find your happy place emotionally here!  But I think it really look gorgeous!

Yea, I&#39;ve been told that I have a lack of detail. Unfortunately, I&#39;m in interested in having a real looking vulva. Not something resembling the weird plastic surgery ideal of women who hate what natural vulvas look like.

You don’t have to like it, but it’s not weird. Some women look like that naturally and plastic surgery is because it’s viewed as a desirable look.

Can you find me an example of a natal vulva that resembles mine? I&#39;ve tried to look pretty exhaustively through the pictures available in the wiki as well as in various subreddits. I legitimately haven&#39;t been able to find one that resembles mine.

Hidden is absolutely right quite a few women have tightened flatter vulvas.  So yours really does not look unnatural.  But if it still bothers you in a year after fully healing you can go back in for a revision.  It&#39;s not uncommon to have a revision surgery to get your labia&#39;s more defined or adjusted.  Hugs hun!

Can you point me to an example? My distress is linked to feeling &#39;uncanny&#39; so actual examples of natal vulvas that look like mine might help me reconcile my appearance.

I shall point you a picture of the wall of vulvas:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/21165114@N07/7165294222" rel="nofollow">https://www.flickr.com/photos/21165114@N07/7165294222
</a>
</p>
<p>
But your vulva resembles what is seen in the bottom left corner.  There is another lipless vulva in the bottom right.  And the second and third rows have multiple different lipless vulvas.
</p>
<p>
So yes your vulva would fit in just fine on the wall of vulvas.
</p>
<p>
Mind Body Green did an article and defines your vulva type as &#34;Small, closed lips&#34;
<a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/types-of-vaginas" rel="nofollow">https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/types-of-vaginas
</a>
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned before this is simply one of the ways vulvas come in naturally and its seen more commonly with younger women.  Some older women&#39;s vulvas stay like this long term though.
</p>
<p>
I actually commented on your thread here because I&#39;m considering a zero depth SRS in the future, and I would really like a vulva that looks just like yours.  I adore the low profile look for a multitude of reasons!

I had a similar situation with limited material, my parents mutilating me as a baby and (I think this might be the case for you too OP) limited body fat. People underestimate how limited body fat is another “risk factor” for less-than-ideal aesthetics initially, but I hear it’s fixable with fat transfers to the labia majora and (if necessary) mons pubis. I’m actually researching this myself now and am very serious about doing it.
</p>
<p>
Speaking only for myself here, the cheerleading in some of the comments probably would have rubbed me the wrong way when I was in a similar place to OP shortly after my SRS. I wanted validation, suggestions for how to improve things and hope that my result could be improved, not to be pushed to just accept things the way they are.
</p>
<p>
I had my SRS with Suporn about a decade ago. A few years later, after doing a revision, he expressly told me that fat transfers to my labia majora (not a procedure he does) would be necessary to really get the aesthetic result I want. I’ve always tended towards being underweight until I started doing keto, somewhat ironically. My labia majora just aren’t full enough IMO to balance out my inner labia/clitoris area.
</p>
<p>
I also thought my vulva looked best, despite the blood and stitches, around day 7 and just went downhill from there as the swelling went down and some tissue started healing and scarring asymmetrically. I had multiple revisions, two major and two minor, to get my vulva to where it’s generally acceptable to me if I don’t over-analyze it with a mirror. I totally understand OP what you mean by feeling like there’s a “lack of detail”; I felt this too, and it is somewhat fixable with a revision. Being circumcised with limited starting material seems to be a risk factor for aesthetics initially not being as good as they otherwise could be. But that said, I don’t think it’s a bad result, and most of us can probably benefit from a revision; it’s just really difficult to get it all right in one surgery. But for a revision, don’t just “trust them to do it”; you’ve got to be hyper-specific with your surgeon about what you want changed. I wish I’d pushed Dr. Suporn harder on some of those details I wanted addressed.
</p>
<p>
OP, my best advice to you is to: 1) consider the result unfinished to whatever extent feels right to you; 2) try to mentally convert any anxieties about more surgery into optimism for making it better; 3) above all else,
<em>
don’t let any negative feelings you have towards your vulva get in the way of dilation
</em>
. This did happen to me; every dilation session was a reminder of dissatisfaction with my result, and I let that along with my dilation pain difficulties get in the way of dilating as often as was really needed. Instead assume that one day everything
<em>
will
</em>
look the way you want it to; future-you will be really grateful to your younger self for keeping up with dilation.
</p>
<p>
Sending you safe hugs. &lt;3 feel free to DM me if you like.

I may have asked this in a prior thread, but would you mind sharing your total costs and the time from initial contact to your surgery date?

Sure, total time from contact to surgery was 8 months. Though he&#39;s booked out for 2 years at this point.
</p>
<p>
Cost was my total out of pocket maximum. Though the self pay rate is 26k + hospital + anesthesia fees.

I think the results look great. Sorry some of the aesthetics are not to your liking. Just fyi, my (cis woman) wife doesn’t have large labia and doesn’t have much definition between the majora and thigh crease… if that helps

In short, no.
</p>
<p>
I honestly think it&#39;s a pretty disappointing mess. It looks very unnatural.

To each their own- it&#39;s your body, and you have every right to be satisfied or not with the results.
</p>
<p>
Personally, if you told me I could snap my fingers and have your results right now but no option for later revision, I&#39;d do so with no hesitation or regrets.

Thanks. Yea, I feel lucky that things largely went well and that I don&#39;t have bad complications.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is different. My dysphoria has a strong component of the fear of being uncanny. So my results looking &#39;real&#39; to me was the most important aspect.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Also I found it interesting in your response that you said you&#39;d accept the results. Not that they looked natural. I suspect some will be fine with one while others will need the other.

I do think they look natural.  If they didn&#39;t look natural I&#39;d be uninterested.  Do I think that your results are porn-quality?  No.  Do I think they&#39;re well-within the normal range of genital appearance?  Very much.  Min Jun was on my radar before this thread as a potential surgeon and I&#39;m only more interested seeing your pictures.
</p>
<p>
The only part of your results I&#39;d be personally unhappy with is not having much in the way of outer labia, but I&#39;d also assume that&#39;s something which is eminently a thing that can be addressed with a revision.
