Glad all went well. Looks like you are healing up nicely.
</p>
<p>
Do you know if you will be changing any of your HRT dosages?

Thank you! I only have very minimal pain now.
</p>
<p>
I ceased spiro immediately but I don’t know if I’m adjusting any E dosages. My levels have been good for a while but I’m going to ask my doctor at my next HRT follow-up.

How do you find tucking now? I am sure there’s still some swelling but looks like it’ll be a lot easier.

I haven’t tried tucking yet. There is some swelling still and everything is still sensitive.
</p>
<p>
But I can tell its going to be so much easier! Tucking used to be very hard for me because my balls were large and gave me extreme dysphoria. Now? Its basically just pushing back my penis

I am so excited for you and jealous. I have a similar issue as well. Tucking isn’t the more comfy and still dysphoric for me.

I really want this done as well, I have a question did too pay out of pocket or did you use insurance for assistance if so was it hard getting it approved?

I went through insurance — Connecticut Medicaid, to be exact. Approval was the hardest part of the whole process because I wanted it done immediately instead of waiting 12 months.
</p>
<p>
The first surgeon completely refused to consider me partially because I was 8 months HRT at the time. He insisted that Medicaid wouldn’t cover it and wasn’t willing to even try. By the time I saw my second urologist (who did my surgery) WPATH had updated to only require 6 months HRT and one letter.
</p>
<p>
My doctor and therapist wrote long, urgent letters to my surgeon. They said that I need this surgery now to avoid self-injury or suicide. Based on these, my surgeon was more than willing to do an orchie a week or so out from consultation.  Once he submitted the paperwork, I was all set. I was 10 months HRT at time of surgery.
</p>
<p>
I hope you can get it done!! My orchiectomy was life changing in the best way possible and I hope it will be for you too. The new WPATH rules will help a lot along with strong letters from your therapist and PCP.

Thank you!!
</p>
<p>
It is possible to remove the scrotum but I kept it so I could use the material for a vaginoplasty. I’m tentatively planning on having that done next year — but I’m also thinking of doing FFS first. My orchiectomy removed so much of my body dysphoria that I can go a lot longer without a vagina than I thought.

Would you mind naming your surgeon?
