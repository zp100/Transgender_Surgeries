Aw thank you!  On both counts :D.
</p>
<p>
I had:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Type III forehead reconstruction
</li>
<li>
Orbital rim contouring and brow lift
</li>
<li>
Upper lip lift
</li>
<li>
Chin and jaw contouring
</li>
</ul>
<p>
They were pretty keen to do my nose as well, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I needed it so I declined.  I think I made the right call - it looks quite balanced to me.
</p>
<p>
Also I went to Dr Rossi in case anyone&#39;s interested.

Love your results!! Looks so natural. I’m here in Buenos Aires and will have my surgery done in 2 days by Dr. Rossi. So excited! And I’m getting the exact same procedures as you! 💗

How has your overall experience been with Rossi and his team? Considering him....

<p>
On the whole I&#39;d recommend him and his team, but I think you do have to take the rough with the smooth.  Here are my thoughts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pros
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Dr Rossi and his team are extremely skilled.  I can&#39;t see that I&#39;d have got a better result going to somewhere like FacialTeam, where I&#39;d have been paying about three times the price.  Which leads me to...
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Cost.  The entire surgical package cost me around £8000 (10,000 USD). In spite of that, I felt there was basically no upselling.  He refused to do a tracheal shave because he felt I didn&#39;t need it, despite this meaning he&#39;d get less money out of me. The closest he came to upselling me was when he suggested after seeing me in person that they also do my nose, but I decided against it and he accepted that.  Other surgeons I&#39;d had consultations with had offered me a whole gamut of unnecessary procedures clearly designed to wring as much money out of me as possible.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dr Rossi&#39;s pre-surgical approach was very thorough by comparison to some other FFS surgeons.  He required quite a few photos in order to put together a quote, and I felt like he really understood my face and how I was supposed to look.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Amanda - she is brilliant.  Available most of the day to help you, very good English, arranges your transport, constantly checking in on you.  She can bring you groceries while you&#39;re recovering.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Buenos Aires itself is a fantastic city where you&#39;ll enjoy spending some time.  You&#39;ll be in Palermo which has some great restaurants and bars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The high turnover of patients means that it&#39;s not too difficult to make contact with other girls who are out there for surgery.  Amanda will generally put you in touch if you ask her.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Cons
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The overall experience is very much no-frills.  This probably accounts for the significant price differential between Rossi and much of the competition in other countries.  The pre-surgery consultations took place in a random clinic, the surgery itself in a quite old public hospital.  They keep you in the hospital overnight but I felt like they couldn&#39;t get rid of me quickly enough, and given how strongly I reacted to the anaesthetic, I felt they were turfing me out way before I was physically ready to leave the hospital.  This is definitely something to bear in mind if you&#39;re considering a few options - Cárdenas has a dedicated recovery centre for example which might make the overall experience more comfortable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added to that, the experience was very isolating because the package didn&#39;t include accommodation, so I booked my own apartment where I went straight back the day after surgery.  It was difficult being alone and recovering without staff directly on hand to help, which is something I could have expected if I&#39;d gone elsewhere for my FFS.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For this reason, if you go with Rossi I strongly recommend you bring someone with you.  Failing that, try and connect with as many of the other girls as you can.  At other centres it&#39;s much, much easier to connect with others.  With T-Change you have to take more initiative if you don&#39;t want to be isolated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I don&#39;t particularly like Dr Rossi as a man. I found him to have the personality of a used car salesman, totally lacking in bedside manner.  When I was having the stitches removed from my lip lift scar, I was in agony, and he mockingly imitated the cries of pain I was making.  I found him to be an arrogant, unsympathetic character.  But you can&#39;t really argue with his results.  (For what it&#39;s worth, the rest of his surgical team when I was in the operating room were fabulous, including and in particular his anaesthetists).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
All in all, it was a life-changing decision and I&#39;m glad I did it.  Money meant that it was either Rossi or no one, but other factors weighed heavily in his favour, including his exceptional forehead work and the fact that I felt like he was honest about what I needed and what I didn&#39;t.  Sure, I found him narcissistic and unpleasant at times, and it was emotionally difficult to be on my own during the recovery, but the positives outweighed the negatives for me.
