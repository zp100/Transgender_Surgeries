Hi Reddit! It&#39;s been about 16 weeks since I had facial feminization surgery with Dr. Bastidas at Northwell Health in NYC. As part of my procedure I had a type 3 forehead reduction, orbital rim reduction, hairline advancement, brow lift, and rhinoplasty. Between the before/after pics I also had a tracheal shave with Dr. Mark Courey at Mt. Sinai. I did not have any work done on my chin or jaw, as I liked my more angular jawline and wanted to keep her. I stayed in the hospital for two nights.
</p>
<p>
Overall I am extremely satisfied with my results. My goal going into surgery was to undo the effects of testosterone puberty, not to pursue a high femme appearance or totally new face. Dr. Bastidas has a subtler approach than other surgeons so it was a good match for me. The surgery was covered in full by Amida Care / NYC Medicaid, after getting letters of necessity from my therapist and my doctor.
</p>
<p>
I have mostly healed at this point, although the hairline incision is still red in some places, and of course things will continue to settle for the next 6-9 months. I have been using silicone scar cream and keeping it out of the sun in order for it to heal. I feel so much better about my new hairline—my old one was a huge insecurity and source of dysphoria. Dr. Bastidas was able to move my hairline forward by almost an inch in the corners, although he told me beforehand that I would likely still need a hair transplant after FFS, and that&#39;s something I will probably seek out in the future. But it&#39;s much better than it was.
</p>
<p>
I will say that for me, the post-surgical depression over the past 2-3 months has been extraordinarily intense. During the first 2 weeks after surgery I was out of it on medications, and once my nose cast and jaw bra came off there was a moment of intense elation seeing my new face for the first time. After that came an intense crash, when it set in how long things would take to heal, and that even though FFS did make me feel a lot better about my face and remove a huge source of dysphoria, it didn&#39;t solve every problem for me in transition (I&#39;m still 6&#39;2&#34;, I still have more work to do on my voice, I still get misgendered). The depression has mostly subsided at this point, thanks in part to going back on Cymbalta, but it was pretty rough for awhile. It was something I was warned about beforehand, but I wasn&#39;t expecting it to hit quite so hard.
</p>
<p>
I feel so, so thankful that I was able to get FFS. It&#39;s one of the most loving things I&#39;ve ever done for myself and I would do it again in a heartbeat.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions!
</p>

hi babes! loved to see your pics and read your experience.
</p>
<p>
i’m currently living in nyc, trying to get ffs asap. i also have amida care. questions:
</p>
<p>
did you need letters from pcp/therapist for consultation?
</p>
<p>
how long did it take you between getting consulted and getting surgery?

Hey! Good luck. Amida Care has been great.
</p>
<p>
Did not need letters for consultation but did need them for insurance approval. I got them during the months after consultation.
</p>
<p>
For Bastidas I had my first coneil ration in December and surgery in April. Very quick compared to other surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Happy to DM if you have other questions!

Wow, this doctor is really a fantastic artist! Such subtle work yet your entire face, especially the eye area, has changed. You say you had no jaw/chin work done but they have an entirely new charm when surrounded with the new features. Also, your entire face looks brighter and happier - not sure if &#39;side effect&#39; of the surgery or the improvement in your overall wellbeing :)

Thank you! I’ve had a few moments questioning whether or not I should’ve asked him to be more aggressive on the brow bone, so it’s really nice to hear you point out the difference in my eyes! Sometimes it feels hard to see what others see. :)

Thanks! I feel really pleased.
</p>
<p>
The only thing I have planned in the near future is a hair transplant to fill in the rest of my hairline. It&#39;s so much better than it was, thank god, but it&#39;s still pulled back some in the corners. The doc warned this would probably be the case so it wasn&#39;t a surprise.

Recovery has been fine physically and taxing mentally. But at this point I’m feeling much better! Pretty much back to normal.
</p>
<p>
I only looked at providers who accept NY Medicaid / Amida Care, which was still a decently sized list, so I didn’t get into any pricing details. I couldn’t have afforded FFS if it wasn’t covered by insurance.
</p>
<p>
I’d look for before/after photos from surgeons who you like and try to find people in the ‘before’ who have similar features to yours. I’ve made posts before about thoughts on FFS “aggressiveness” and selecting a provider, take a look in my profile.

Hmm I will have to see if it’s covered by my insurance. I imagine there are prerequisites and counseling. Is that the case?

It’s probably heavily dependent on your carrier.

Just did a quick google and it looks like my state covers it. Given that plans are dependent on state… don’t hold your breath if you’re in the south.

Yep, you will probably need to get two letters of necessity to submit to insurance, one from your doctor and one from a mental health professional.

The top of my scalp hasn’t fully regained sensation yet, but it’s maybe… 80% there? It gets very itchy.

Hey, you look amazing! I wanted to ask why you opted to get your tracheal shave from Dr. Courey instead? Planning on consulting with Bastidas for my FFS, and wondering if I should also consider doing the tracheal shave part of it elsewhere.

Hey! I knew for certain that I wanted a trachea shave but I was still on the fence about FFS, so I ended up scheduling surgery with Dr. Courey first and then Bastidas afterwards. I haven&#39;t heard anything that would lead me to believe Dr. Bastidas is unqualified to perform a trachea shave, but it did help me rest easy knowing my trachea shave was with an ENT. There are different techniques surgeons can use that are more risky than others.

That&#39;s good to know ty! Thinking of doing only a tracheal shave too, to see if that alone will make enough of a difference in framing my face

someone&#39;s self esteem is a difficult issue requiring sensitivity and consideration of one&#39;s emotions. whether or not graffiti is painting is not. that comparison sucks.
</p>
<p>
based on OP&#39;s reaction and your responses to me i feel confident that you lack any sensitivity, and as such, tact.
</p>
<p>
enjoy your valid, though rude and demeaning, opinion. I have no idea how the former makes the latter more comforting for you

I wasn’t seeking criticism on a surgery I already had?? I posted a no-makeup, brutally honest comparison in order to help other girls. Challenging you or anyone else to do the same.

You look amazing! I&#39;m not sure how old the before pictures are, but whether the rest of your face has changed since then or if the results of surgery affect how other elements of your face look in comparison, you really look incredible. And you look a lot happier and more comfortable. And while the changes are subtle, they drastically change the way you appear. Was it difficult to get your insurance to approve the surgery as medically necessary or did it just require those letters?

Thank you 💛💛 Before pics were taken in January, at around 15 months HRT. My surgery was in April. After pics were taken today, in July, at 21 months HRT. A lot has happened internally and externally during this time. It hasn’t been easy but I feel more and more confident in my body, and I’m beginning to release anxiety and fear that I’ve held onto for most of my life, even well into transition. FFS has absolutely been life-changing for me.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t have any trouble with insurance, miraculously. Submitted letters from my doctor and therapist and they accepted it without issue.

I&#39;ve been on hrt for 5 years and I&#39;m still changing physically. Obviously still changing mentally. And I&#39;m still breaking down fears and issues about my transition. It&#39;s a long road. I don&#39;t think you ever really stop transitioning in one way or another. I&#39;m glad surgery has been so helpful for you.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been under the impression that there was no way I could afford ffs but I&#39;m seeing more about people getting it covered and that&#39;s really comforting. Now I just need to see if I&#39;m medically able to have it.

Transition is for life 💛 but wouldn’t mind spending a little less time thinking about it every day 😛
</p>
<p>
Absolutely look into whether your insurance covers it. I wouldn’t have been able to afford it otherwise.
