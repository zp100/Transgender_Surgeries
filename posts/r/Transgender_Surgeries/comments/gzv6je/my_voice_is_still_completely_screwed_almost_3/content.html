So I had a tracheal shave in august 2017. To this day, I have very little volume. And both my &#34;girl&#34; and &#34;guy&#34; range just sound fucked. I go through this cycle of losing my voice almost completely for about two weeks, then it becomes what I call &#34;usable&#34; for about 6 months and then out of nowhere I lose it again.
</p>
<p>
Too this day using the phone feels like russian roulette, will I be able to make it through the call with the person on the other end being able to understand me?
</p>
<p>
In 2019 I tried professional voice therapist for 4 months, with pretty much 0 results. I went to a doctor that specialized in throat and larynx. He said every looked normal on images and paper. Even had a ct scan, to be told it still just looked normal.
</p>
<p>
I kinda just gave up at that point. Does anyone here have any advice or options I could take? I&#39;m starting feel like the only way I can talk reliably again would be voice reconstruction sugery.
</p>
<p>
TLDR: it&#39;s been a very frustrating 3 years, and I dont want to say I regret the sugery, but it&#39;s starting not to feel worth it.

God, that must suck. So sorry that was your outcome. This right here is my greatest fear. My voice passes very, very well. Can you share who your surgeon was? If you don&#39;t feel comfortable posting it as a comment can you send it as a DM?

It was Dr. Rumer, shes based around Philadelphia, she has a very good reputation. I&#39;m not mad at her for my sugery being what seems to be a rare fluke. I also had to have Dr. Rumer remove a cyst from the incision area a little less than a year afterwards.
</p>
<p>
At this point it more just about being able to talk and be understood.
</p>
<p>
The sad thing is though, this first sugery has really really pushed me back from any others. If one so simple could affect my overall quality of life so negatively, it makes me scared. I still want SRS and a breast augmentation, but it has really affected my self esteem about it.
</p>
<p>
Ntm with talking being such a hassle, it makes it really difficult for me to call or reach out to doctors.

Hmmmm she has a lot of negative reviews here. One was botched GRS and it looked horrific and some other issues. I heard she is a mixed bag. Much like Bart Van de Ven who has been nicknamed &#34;The Dutch Menace&#34; by some. But I may be wrong as I have no personal experience with her.

When I went to my doctor saying I was thinking of going with Rumer for GRS (mostly because of proximity and the fact that she accepts my insurance) she flat out told me she would never write me a letter of approval for Rumer.

Well I know I&#39;m probably not going to her again, I was originally recommended her from my endocrinologist. And the women&#39;s center I get my HRT from. I couldnt really find anything negative at the time, but that was 3 years ago.
</p>
<p>
Anyone know of other high reputation surgeons in PA? I probably wont plan anything with all this craziness with COVID19, but it would be nice to know for the future. I don&#39;t really make enough that long travel and hotel fees would be feasible for me.

I know how you feel. I got botched recently in Belgium. I still don&#39;t know why I got the short end of the stick. I will see a renowned surgeon here in the UK and will get a second opinion. I may get the thing that seems to be a suture that was left under my chin removed too if possible. It has stayed for 4 months and never went away.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t know what to advise, hope I can suggest something. If you&#39;ve seen ENTs and they say it is normal, it maybe something unknown and unique and Rumer should get an award in the form of a flying axe to her head for fucking you up good. I would be livid if I were you but that&#39;s just me.

I appreciate your thoughts. I think part of it is I always thought that it would somehow heal, but losing my voice completely for idk what feels like the 12th time since the sugery three years later kinda triggered something in my head. It&#39;s why I vented here. The most I ever got from an ent was swollen and The CT scan showed everything was normal. I kinda feel hopeless now. Even if I try to talk in a deep voice, it sounds destroyed and many times unintelligible. Idk what to do.
</p>
<p>
They only positive I have anymore is it made passing a complete non issue. But I&#39;m struggling with what it cost me.

I&#39;m not familiar with this surgery and its many complications as I never felt I needed it. Maybe see more ENTs for a second opinion. If you already have then maybe whatever Rumer did it completely changed the insides of your throat. It healed but left you with the voice that you now have or if you had an infection this is one of its consequences. I&#39;m sorry I hope we both find light at the end of the tunnel.

I&#39;ve heard mixed reviews of her. I did have a friend who got SRS and a trachea shave with her maybe about 4 months before you had your surgery. I&#39;ve never asked her about the SRS results, but I have heard speak and it really didn&#39;t change one way or the other. I sent you a DM.

I collect information on surgeons. You should read this on Kathy Rumer, and any other surgeon you might be thinking of.

Or share it publicly, to protect the community as a whole, instead of protecting the surgeon.

Get in contact with
<a href="https://www.voicedoctor.net/" rel="nofollow">Dr. James Thomas
</a>
, the surgeon who does FemLar.
</p>
<p>
When I went for my consult, I talked to a former patient of his who had the same problem you did: a botched trach shave screwed up her voice (and she&#39;s a singer!). But he was able to reattach her vocal cords and fix her voice (and it sounded really fantastic when I talked to her).
</p>
<p>
Seriously, get in contact with him. Chances are there&#39;s a way for him to fix whatever&#39;s wrong with your voice box.

Thanks for the info. I&#39;ll see if I can get in touch with them. The only issue is I really can&#39;t afford travel too a city on the other side of the country. I don&#39;t make alot of money, and he&#39;s in Oregon, I&#39;m in PA. So my Hope&#39;s aren&#39;t too high.

Ah, okay. I would still definitely get in contact with them, as they might be able to work something out, or recommend someone more local who might be able to do the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Good luck!
