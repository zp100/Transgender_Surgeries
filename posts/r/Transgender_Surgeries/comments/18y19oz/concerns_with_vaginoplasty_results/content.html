You should define your labia minora and eliminate your erectile tissue, take care of yourself, beautiful friend.

Hello everyone!
<br>
I had my surgery almost 9 months ago (penile inversion with scrotal skin graft) and I have a couple of frustrations for which I would love to ask for some advice :)Just to preface it, I am overall pretty happy with how the surgery went, no real complications, fairly quick recovery, however 2 things frustrate me quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
When I get aroused the tissue around my urethra swells quite a bit to the point it is somewhat uncomfortable. I have read somewhere that some swelling is normal, but based on most accounts I think mine is beyond what I read to be normal. I suspect too much sponge tissue was left behind, this seems to be a fairly common issue people face with, but I am not 100% sure of this (I love to second guess myself...). I also feel like my urethra opening is too large, but my doctor said to both of these, that this is normal.
</p>
<p>
My second big issue is, that I have hair growth in my vaginal canal (even though I asked my doctor multiple times regarding hair removal to which the response repeatedly was that it &#34;won&#39;t be an issue&#34;...). I have a good electrolysis technician who is willing to try to remove it, although I am not really looking forward to that torture, but would that even be possible/sufficient or should I just go to a revision right away? (btw my doctor said it will just fall out from use... which I can&#39;t help but doubt)
<br>
Other than this I feel like my vagina is a bit low (?). It feels like there is a steep downward angle to reach the &#34;entrance&#34; and a &#34;ball&#34; is below the urethra. Is this normal? I don&#39;t have particular issues with this, as I am still able to dilate just fine, but I was wondering if this is something I should pay more attention to (also the angle is a bit annoying during sex)
<br>
As a last (mini) vent, I was sad that (if my anatomy knowledge is not mistaken) I don&#39;t seem to have a labia minora, which I only found out about post surgery, but generally I think it looks nice :,)
</p>
<p>
Every piece of input is much appreciated &lt;3

Your doctore is definitely being dismissive, your concerns are totally valid and definitely fixable in revision. I can see that the erectile tissue around urethra might cause some discomfort and it definitely exposes it too much.
</p>
<p>
About the hair part, id definitely let the electrologyst take a look inside before jumping into revision in order to check how deep the growth is. If its not too deep, i would definitely try to get then removed this way
</p>
<p>
The canal part, i cant tell 100% but sounds normal to me, as long as you don&#39;t feel any obstacles when dilating, is the way the canal points
</p>
<p>
I think labia can get defined afterwards, too.
</p>
<p>
Wherever you go for revision go to another one and a reputable surgeon. Hugs

Thank you for your response &lt;3
</p>
<p>
I will definitely look for another surgeon for my revision.
</p>
<p>
Regarding opening of the canal, I am able to dilate properly (~13cm / 5&#34; ), usually once I am past the &#34;bump&#34; it is smooth, and I only sometimes feel discomfort when I am at about full depth. I think (hope) this is normal :D
</p>
<p>
( sorry if my description is confusing, I think I am bad at describing things ;~; )

I haven&#39;t done my surgery yet, but I read that the extra sponge tissue around urethra after the first surgery is normal. And doctors usually do this intentionally to prevent it from being damaged during dilations. Usually this can be corrected with revision surgery.

Some heads up would have been nice from the doctors, but this makes me optimistic :)

I went to Curtis Crane for my original surgery and had an extremely similar result (he studied under Dr. Dor). You can easily resolve the erectile tissue problem with another surgeon and some more aesthetic work done and have a fine looking vagina (she’s already v pretty!).
</p>
<p>
Idk much about hair treatment but I hope you’re able to get it resolved doll

I&#39;m sorry for you, I&#39;m sorry, a revision surgery will help you with the labia and spongy tissue inside the vagina, if you can tell me in which country and with which doctor you had the surgery, in Brazil we have Dr Márcio Litletton who does the revision and leaves the most cis vagina possible

Hi there, did you go to Dr Marcio, I am looking to find a doctor with the most beautiful aesthetic results from the outside, with beautifully defined labia majora and minora and clitoris AND adequate depth, function and lubrication .

It looks like a solid, workman result and you have healed nicely.  I think an revision dealing with the erectile tissue and aesthetics  will greatly improve your results.👍

My results are extremely similar however I have slightly less erectile tissue around the urethra, our vaginas look nearly identical, have you had issues with penetration? I can dilate fine but just can’t have successful penetration during sex, also the urethra is so sensitive especially when aroused and it makes me wince every time something even touches it. Please dm me I’d love to hear what your course of action is I can verify I also went to the same surgeon

Thank you for your kind reply, I will DM you shortly :)
<br>
Just for public record I was able to have sex, the most annoying part for me (I think) is caused by the hair inside which is sometimes rubbing in an unpleasant manner.
<br>
I have not noticed any hypersensitivity, however I would like to mention, that I had some sensitivity issues prior surgery. (Unrelated to anything HRT)
