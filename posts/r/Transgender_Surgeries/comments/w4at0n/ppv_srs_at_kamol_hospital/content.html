Two months post-op and I just had my first purely vaginal orgasm! It was amazing. I can’t say enough good things about Kamol Hospital and Darcie Silver who helped arrange my surgery. Here’s me talking about my experience:

It has been a wonderful experience. I am almost four months post-op and pretty much completely healed. I still dilate twice a day, but I have almost 6.5” depth and sensation is great. I achieve orgasms easily with a little penetration and clitoral stimulation. My vagina is self-lubricating, and it also looks very natural, with clearly defined clitoris, inner labia, and outer labia. It feels awesome :-)

Thanks for your kind reply and I have more questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Post op people said that  Small size of penis has no problem with PPV to get enough depth, Id it true?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dilation period is less with PPV, about 6 months,Is that true?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<a href="https://3.How" rel="nofollow">3.How</a>

1) my penis skin was used to create my labia and inner labia, and my scrotal skin was used to create the first two inches on my vaginal canal. Thus, it is VERY important to make sure your scrotum is hair-free, unless you want hair growing out of the entrance of your vagina. Beyond the first two inches, my vaginal canal is peritoneal tissue.
</p>
<p>
2) I am at five months post-op and I currently dilate for an hour to an hour and a half, in one session. I will continue to dilate like this for at least a year because I want to preserve the 6–6.5 inch depth I currently enjoy. After a year, I will see how it goes before I stop dilating less. But I also enjoy dilating, it feels good and I use the time to read, catch up on emails, watch TV etc.
</p>
<p>
3) life was back to normal at about three months, although I have been walking since my second week post-op. At five months I can exercise vigorously and occasionally skip a day dilating without any worry. I have never experienced any pain, only a little discomfort in the first couple of weeks post-op. Dilating has never been painful for me, but my experience may be an exception rather than the rule. Everything now looks and feels great.
</p>
<p>
4) I have real penetrative sex with my girlfriend, who uses a six inch strap-on dildo, the size of a large male. It is pleasurable and I can easily orgasm with penetration and clitoral stimulation.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps :-)

hello, Dr. Kamol says that he takes care of the hair on the scrotal tissue during the operation. What do you think about that? Thanks for your lovely review.

I would not rely on my surgeon to take care of the hair on my scrotal tissue. I would (and did) have extensive laser hair removal in that area, and my vagina is now completely hair-free. Don’t take any chances with something this important. That is my advice.

You are shadow banned by reddit and no one can see your posts unless manually approved by a moderator. You need to get it fixed.
