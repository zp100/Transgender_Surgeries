I‚Äôm a 73 yo transgender woman. I am a Lesbian. Briefly I want to share my journey to give hope to all who are transitioning.
</p>
<p>
Growing up I knew I was a girl in a boys body. It was also a time that was very taboo on the subject. Parents forced me to do boy things because they felt the femininity of my sisters were rubbing off on me. I learned how to cover the feelings up and did the manly things in life, like join military, get married, have children. Suppressing my true self for tens of years, occasionally trying to be the true me, but always failing.
</p>
<p>
In 2011 my life changed dramatically and I slowly pushed the limits of being the true me. It was hard because I worked as a government contractor for the military.
</p>
<p>
In 2018 my youngest son bought a house in Georgia with a mother in law house. He said come live with us. Here was my opportunity!  I told him about me and he said he knew and that‚Äôs why they bought the house they did. I sold my house, filed for social security, retired from my job, sold most of my belongings, and moved from Massachusetts to Georgia as Shelby, my true self.
</p>
<p>
Spent remainder of 2018 and most of 2019 seeing a therapist, and changing documents to correct name and gender. Meanwhile I had breast augmentation, permanent makeup on eyes and lips, laser and electrolysis on my face, monthly pedicures and manicures, and finding my style.
</p>
<p>
All of my family accepts and supports me. Most of my previous close work friends accept and support me. I have a couple of close friends here, but mainly my socializing is with my son‚Äôs family and his friends (he‚Äôs in the Navy). I kind of kept socializing to a minimum because of not having bottom surgery. But that will change.
</p>
<p>
I had GCS 6 days ago at the age of 73. I feel wonderful and complete. I never thought these last couple of years would ever happen, let alone bottom surgery. But I continued to hold onto my dreams and one day an opportunity was presented. It was now or never!!
</p>
<p>
I know each person‚Äôs journey is different and has its own challenges. I just wanted to briefly share mine as a way of saying don‚Äôt ever give up, it‚Äôs never too late, and dreams do come true!!
</p>

It&#39;s so wonderful that you were finally able to free yourself.  The societal pressure to conform to what we look like when we are born is incredibly burdensome.  I&#39;m glad you were able to love life as you know you must.

Thanks for the inspiration.  I&#39;m 65 and seeing my therapist for 5+ months now.  I also am now seeing one specific in trans therapy.  I know it&#39;s never too late.  I am taking things very conservatively but I felt I needed to.  Planning on HRT in the coming months and simply taking things one day at a time.
</p>
<p>
Based on others experiences with HRT, were yours similar or different since we are a bit older?  I know it varies for everyone but am curious so I know what to expect.

As far as HRT goes, I didn‚Äôt really expect much because of my age. I‚Äôve been on 1mg of Estradiol. My Spironolactone was stopped about 2 weeks ago (25mg). I elected low doses because of my age and expectations. Have I noticed differences? Maybe smoother skin and finer hair growth. Just don‚Äôt think this is a magic pill to make you young and beautiful and you‚Äôll be happy and content with whatever it does.

Thanks for the reply.  For me, I am looking to minimize my incongruence between mind and body.  I&#39;m not looking for any magic.

Glad you have achieved so much of your dream. I am 71 and am also in the midst of a somewhat slower transition given family concerns and work (at least til Covid is better controlled. As many of our sisters are, served in Navy, now retired. You have accomplished much despite the barriers. Congratulations.  üò∑üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüëèüëè

Might take me a minute to write this, waiting on nails to dry, a constant love hate situation.
</p>
<p>
Just into my mid 50&#39;s and so of course I believe I relate to you, whether I do or not.
</p>
<p>
Too late....wow...those 2 words, we ask ourselves, is it &#34;too &#34;late&#34;
</p>
<p>
I guess you have proven it&#39;s not, but I think I need a little more encouragement.
</p>
<p>
Lifelong issue that surfaced repeatedly, only to be put back in her box. This time a few months ago, the Genie refused to go back in the bottle, even after we agreed it would, not this time I/She decided not again. Anyway I&#39;m almost to my point about age. So by the way, I&#39;ve researched a nearby clinic/hospital and therapists, I think it&#39;s a pretty good setup, so tomorrow I&#39;m making the HRT appointment, just to see, you know what I mean üòä I mean just for more info.
</p>
<p>
Now to address your post in a way I haven&#39;t seen anyone else do.
</p>
<p>
You were discussing clothes, etc...and your &#34;style&#34; I still work full time, but in many ways I control my own style. Recently I was chatting with another married Trans woman here, or so she said, anyway, we discussed going out in public, and although this person purported to be an expert in this field had never actually gone out in public. I mentioned that I was working on an outfit that my wife and I thought I could pull off at a nightspot we want to visit, without a wig, I can&#39;t make those work yet. But anyway I said that I was going for a Katherine Hepburn sort of style. 1 she had never heard of KH and 2 didn&#39;t understand the idea of style, only if the outfit made her look hot.
</p>
<p>
I want to look hot and sexy too. But I&#39;m old enough to prefer looking like I have class and style. How can I be Trans and painting my nails and still sound boring?
