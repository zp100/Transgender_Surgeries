Congratulations on being done with the surgery!  Iâ€™m so sorry to hear your recovery is so painful, I really hope it gets better now with the adjustment in meds.
</p>
<p>
Donâ€™t worry about comparing yourself to others. Everyoneâ€™s journey is different :)
</p>
<p>
Good luck in your continued healing and I hope the dressing removal goes well!

Congratulations!!! I am glad you are having some pain relief. I had my surgery last July and am happier than I have ever been. Enjoy your new configuration.

I was there about a year ago and I cannot believe how much time has passed.  Those first few days were the most painful yet peaceful days of my life.  My mantra was &#34;you&#39;ve got this girl, just breathe, one step at a time, you&#39;ve got this, you can do difficult things.&#34;  Thank you for sharing your experience and congratulations on your new vulva and vagina.

It&#39;s totally normal to have this much pain, right?

Yes, itâ€™s a very major surgery. Itâ€™s totally normal to have a lot of pain. It is unfortunate when the pain medication doesnâ€™t work as well as it should, but pain is entirely normal.  It will get better :)

Yes it is. Pain for each of us is a deeply personal experience so making any kind of comparison will always be flawed. My second night in hospital care was by far the most painful of my life and I ended up being put back on an IV to help climb to the top of where my pain was. It will and does get better though so keep in mind how close to the beginning you are and just take it slow, take it very slow.

How lucid are you when they give you these drugs? Is it just like a hazy day or so? I would think that helps to tune out the pain if youâ€™re kind off in a dream state

Which drugs?
</p>
<p>
The anesthetic was almost instant. I wa so relaxed.
</p>
<p>
The painkillers are awful. I&#39;m fully lucid, feeling like I&#39;m going to pass out from pain. It&#39;s been that way since I woke up from surgery actually.

Thatâ€™s what I missed was about the painkillers. I wondered if it would be so strong after the surgery where it just knocks you out. Sorry to hear itâ€™s been so rough

Not in my experience. The strongest thing they offer gets me down from a 10 to a 7, or a 7 down to a 5.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I got down to a 4 and it was amazing. No suchk luck today.
