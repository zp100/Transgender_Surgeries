Thank you. Swollen but moving along well. Drains are kinda pinching where they are sutured in and the catheter feels different. New sensations and totally worth it. It‚Äôll be a recovery for sure but I am already so happy now

They splay your body out to make sure they‚Äôre not putting pressure on the surgical area, so maybe from that.

Ohhh I remember that pain, it was almost too much to bear, being stuck in a slightly upright position with a woefully thin hard mattress üò© Boy was I glad to finally move and gain some relief

I really think standard procedure should be a low air loss mattress after surgery. Luckily I work in the healthcare field and can ask for those other items. But if I was on that other mattress I‚Äôd defiantly have a pressure ulcer because it was getting bad. I‚Äôll be getting new pics today and keeping up with the journey

That‚Äôs good. I had my surgery in Thailand so there was a bit of a language barrier and nobody with me to advocate for me. Plus I was out of it on meds for a while haha.

Oh, wow!   I hear Schechter does both PPT and PI.  Which did you have?  [EDIT: I see you mention PI in another reply]
</p>
<p>
Annnnd...how long did you wait from consultation to surgery for Dr.S.?

He prefers PI and will do PPT for revision or if there is not a lot of tissue to work with. It was about 2 year wait however there has been some changes in his offices so I believe the wait list isn‚Äôt as long as it was due to Covid and office changes

PI and the team has indicated that the made about 6.5 depth and that dilation will maintain or possibly increase this sizing. From Doctors team that I‚Äôve spoken with including dedicated PT who facilitate and assist with dilation she said that his patients don‚Äôt have issues and I only have the larger two dilators. The words of encouragement are so great. Honestly today I woke up with a lot of pain and my IVs are really really hurting. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll have a smooth Friday. I don‚Äôt know how some individuals are discharged so soon I‚Äôll be with this team until Tuesday before heading home for a few days.
