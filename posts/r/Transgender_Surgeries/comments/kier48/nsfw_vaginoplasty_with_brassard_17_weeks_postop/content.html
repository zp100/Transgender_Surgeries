The sensation is amazing. It took a little while to get the hang of it, and since the sides of the clit are covered by skin still (working on fixing that!) it’s not super easy to stimulate, but still much better than the old set.
</p>
<p>
Internally everything is super sensitive, even just touching the inside is overwhelming. I can’t play around with my inner bits yet because I have a fair amount of hypergranulation at the back, but man I am excited for it.
</p>
<p>
I can’t quite reach a full climax yet. It feels like a quarter of one, but divided all across my body. It gets more intense each week as the nerves recover. When I’m laying on my side, though, and thinking lewd thoughts before or after sleeping, I feel an intense pleasure sensation all throughout my body, and nothing I felt with the old equipment comes close to feeling like that. I can also feel myself start to get wet down there. Best way I can describe it is like the feeling of an erection but all over you. It’s so nice.

After dilating, yes. After about an hour it goes back to a normal position. It is also only when my legs are spread wide.
</p>
<p>
Mine also looks a bit more open because the outer labia’s bottom part is still sitting inside a little, thanks to a small dehiscence in the scar.

I had mine back in 2005, looks somewhat similar but my inner labia is thicker. Does he use scrotal tissue for the inner labia? Just yesterday, I looked at it more closely in the mirror and noticed the skin appears scrotal-like, to the touch as well. Can someone confirm?

No, he does not use scrotal tissue for the inner labia. He (very rarely) uses it for the lining of the vagina if there isn’t enough material, but most of the time the scrotum is just discarded.
</p>
<p>
The inner labia is made of the urethra from the shaft AFAIK. Same kind of skin as the inside of your mouth. I was told it would feel weird for a couple months when it’s dry but should eventually have a consistent smooth texture (which it has become since.)

I had my surgery in 2005 and my inner labia isn&#39;t like the inside of my mouth, at all (i..e mucosal)!. To the touch, it actually feels more like penile tissue, not scrotal tissue so I think this is what he used. And it feels similar to the tissue inside my vagina. In my case, the end of my inner vagina is lined with scrotal tissue and I know that he also used scrotal tissue to create the outer labia. Scrotal tissue is definitely not discarded.

It looks great. This could almost be a picture of mine at 17 weeks. Brassard really does have a distinct style. I had my first orgasm right around the 17 week mark and it was amazing. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get there too. When you say that the sides of your clit are covered with skin, do you mean that the labia minora have fused over it? This happened to my friend and she just had to slowly work it back open over a number of days.

I’ve been using a silicone gel twice a day, plus massaging them. They’re soft as can be!
</p>
<p>
I did get a keloid from on of the suture scar holes a week or so ago, but I luckily had hydrocortisone cream so it’s gone now

No. The results are good but the fact the cavity isn&#39;t pink is a dead giveaway. Also the scarring but that&#39;ll get better with time.

excellent placement and that&#39;s normal, the hood normally is attached and can&#39;t be retracted.
