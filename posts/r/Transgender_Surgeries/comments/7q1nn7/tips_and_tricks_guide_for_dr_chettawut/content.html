<strong>
If anyone else had anything useful that I left out, feel free to add it in the comments and I will update this!
</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>
Before you leave:
</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
1)
</strong>
Book business class flights coming home, the extra reclining room is worth it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
2)
</strong>
Pack light. You can buy clothes super cheap here and you will have room for souvenirs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
3)
</strong>
Bring a Netflix device. Firestick, Apple TV, Chromecase, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
4)
</strong>
Get your passport early. It can take up to 6 weeks to process a request, and if there is a problem you have to start over.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
5)
</strong>
Show the email Som gives you with the bank transfer info to the agent at your bank, they will know how to fill it out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
6)
</strong>
Make sure your blood work clinic does all the tests you need. Show them the list and have them double check.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
7)
</strong>
Getting recommendation letters is pretty straightforward and shouldn&#39;t require more than 2-3 sessions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
8)
</strong>
Make sure your phone isn&#39;t SIM locked. If it is, you can&#39;t use a Thai SIM card. If it&#39;s locked, download and register the Food Panda app before you leave the country so you can order food to your hotel easier.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
9)
</strong>
Take off your nail polish before you leave, it will mess with the heart rate monitors while in surgery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
10)
</strong>
Pack for warm weather, its almost always summer temp in Thailand.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
11)
</strong>
Bring a friend of family member at any cost. Going alone would be very difficult as you can&#39;t really get up for long in the first few weeks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
12)
</strong>
Take some before pictures, or even get a Clone-a-Willy kit for the novelty.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
13)
</strong>
Get in shape. You will probably gain some weight laying around in bed for 2 months so prepare for it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
14)
</strong>
Bring old underwear. You will probably ruin a few pair.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
15)
</strong>
You have to stop smoking/drugs and HRT at least 2 weeks before you leave. Not doing this can cause serious complications. You can&#39;t start hormones again until you are back home.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
16)
</strong>
Be ready to need the extra skin graft. It&#39;s an extra 1000usd. He will also ask if you want a trachea shave for an additional 1800usd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
17)
</strong>
If you&#39;re staying at the Vertical Suite, make sure to specify what kind of room you want.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
18)
</strong>
Make sure you have to someone to take care of your pets and etc while you&#39;re gone.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
19)
</strong>
You still need to take at least 1 extra month off work after you get back, more if you have a physically demanding job.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
20)
</strong>
Be careful with anal sex, scar tissue on your colon can cause your depth to be cut short.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
21)
</strong>
Make sure your credit/debit card works internationally.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
24)
</strong>
You need to fill out the arrivals form handed out on the plane to Bangkok, and you will need the hotel address and phone. Here is the info for the Vertical Suite
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>
After you arrive:
</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
1)
</strong>
Go through customs at the airport, right after will be stalls to exchange money and get a SIM card. I recommend getting around 10k baht in cash for shopping and food.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
2)
</strong>
Your driver will be sitting along the main hallway holding a sign with your name. If you don&#39;t see him at meeting area 3, patrol the hallway looking for people holding signs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
3)
</strong>
If your phone doesn&#39;t update the time automatically, make sure you Google the time in Bangkok and update it manually.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
4)
</strong>
Eat while you can, the day after your consultation is the start of your liquid only diet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
5)
</strong>
Do stuff while you can. You never realize how much you take walking for granted until you&#39;re post op.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
6)
</strong>
Get a Japanese table (breakfast in bed style) so you don&#39;t have to get up to eat or play on a laptop.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
7)
</strong>
Hold the enema in at least 10 minutes or so to get really cleared out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
8)
</strong>
Mix the Swiff with sprite in a glass and let it sit for an hour to go flat. After that chug it and you won&#39;t taste it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
9)
</strong>
Use baby wipes or the bidet to clean yourself after Swiff or your butthole will feel like it&#39;s on fire.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
10)
</strong>
Wake up early on your surgery day to drink some water. Nothing at all, even water, after 7am.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
11)
</strong>
Gum can trick your stomach into thinking you&#39;re eating so you won&#39;t be as hungry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
12)
</strong>
On your op day be ready to have your junk and buttcrack shaven by the nurse.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
13)
</strong>
Stock up on &#34;soft&#34; foods to eat after your op. Scrambled eggs, French toast, chocolate milk, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
14)
</strong>
Get a bucket to dump your cathitor bag into so you don&#39;t have to get up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
15)
</strong>
Pick up a pillow case to put your donut pillow in if you want it to be more discreet.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
16)
</strong>
The driver doesn&#39;t speak any English so don&#39;t worry if he doesn&#39;t try and talk to you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
17)
</strong>
Bring your phone charger when you head in for surgery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
18)
</strong>
Don&#39;t bring anyone with you to the clinic when its surgery time, they will have to leave very soon after they arrive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
19)
</strong>
They will call your hotel room when your surgery is done to let whoever came with you know its done.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
20)
</strong>
Wear underwear the day of your op, the nurse will strap your cath bag to it on your way home.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
21)
</strong>
Buy some cheap skirts/dresses to lay around in. Its makes dilation easier and is less effort to put on.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>
Vertical Suite specific:
</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
1)
</strong>
You can talk to the person in the lobby to book touristy things around the city. They have tours, cooking classes, floating market boat rides, elephant baths, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
2)
</strong>
If you want a great view, take the elevator up to floor 22 and take the stairs the rest of the way up. There are 4 more floors above that are under construction and the view is amazing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
3)
</strong>
You can order a clear soup from the dinner menu that you can eat pre-op. It&#39;s much better than the bullion at the Tesco.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
4)
</strong>
Breakfast is free and going down even to only drink coffee is a great way to meet other Chett girls.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
5)
</strong>
Seacon square across the street has a Tesco with most anything you need.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
6)
</strong>
There is a 7/11 down the street that has basic supplies like pads and water.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
7)
</strong>
Don&#39;t throw the glass water bottles they give you away, they send them off to get refilled.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
8)
</strong>
Make sure the washer is on cold or else your clothes will shrink.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
9)
</strong>
Hold down the power button to start the stove top. The H means the burner is hot and it will power off automatically if all burners are off.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
10)
</strong>

<strong>
11)
</strong>
The time on the hotel landline phones is an hour behind, always check on Google.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
12)
</strong>
US plugs will fit in the outlets but there are not very many outlets.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
13)
</strong>
There is a pool, gym, and sauna on the 5th floor.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
14)
</strong>
Housekeeping and the nurses usually come between noon and 3, so get your dilation done before and after that. You can lock the bedroom doors so the housekeeping won&#39;t come in.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
15)
</strong>
The shower will leak through the cracks next to the wall, so be careful with the sprayer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>
Post op:
</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
1)
</strong>
Try and sleep in the clinic as much as possible, it will make the time go faster.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
2)
</strong>
The clinic is cold, If you have someone visit tell them to bring something warm.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
3)
</strong>
Rotate your feet the first few days to keep blood flowing to your legs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
4)
</strong>
There won&#39;t be much pain, just the feeling like you have a really good tuck and have to pee really bad.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
5)
</strong>
Getting the drainage tube removed hurts but only for half a second.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
6)
</strong>
You can choose to have crackers with your soup for meals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
7)
</strong>
For morning 1 you get get 2 drinks. I recommend the hot cocoa.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
8)
</strong>
Try and not sit up as much as you can, it puts pressure on the surgical site.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
9)
</strong>
The morning after your surgery you will have to walk downstairs to the recovery room. Your legs will be numb so take it very slow.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
10)
</strong>
You can sleep on your side with a pillow between your legs if you start to get a bed sore on your bum.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
11)
</strong>
You can ask for an anti gas tablet if you need to fart but can&#39;t.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
12)
</strong>
When it&#39;s time to go home they will help you get dressed and bring your things to the car. The ride is not fun.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
13)
</strong>
Stay in bed as much as possible when you get back to your room. Have the person that came with you get everything for you. Standing up will make you very dizzy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
14)
</strong>
They give you meds to constipate you until the packing comes out so follow the soft food diet until then.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
15)
</strong>
Keep your legs together as much as possible to keep stress off the stitches.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
16)
</strong>
Keep a bed pad down at all times to keep blood off the bed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
17)
</strong>
Make sure to take all your antibiotic and anti swelling when your suppose to.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
18)
</strong>
Getting the packing out doesn&#39;t hurt but is a weird feeling. They remove the tape then snip the stitching holding the packing inside then pull it out. Feels like taking a poo. After they measure your depth and take a picture.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
19)
</strong>
After the packing comes out you can shower and remove the tape residue. Be careful as you will still likely get very light headed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
20)
</strong>
Don&#39;t push when trying to poo the first time, it should happen in the first few days after the packing comes out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
21)
</strong>
Your urethra will be a lot more sensitive after you start dilation, moving the cathitor bag hurts like fire.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
22)
</strong>
Pay attention when the nurse demonstrates dilation, if you mess it up you could seriously hurt yourself.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
23)
</strong>
Find a Netflix series to watch during dilation as you will only have 1 usable hand.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
24)
</strong>
The first few days will hurt dilating but it gets easier the more often you do it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
25)
</strong>
Pay attention to your schedule, set reminders on your phone when to change your routine again.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
26)
</strong>
If your having trouble sleeping, tell the nurses. They will give you a pill to help.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
27)
</strong>
Getting the cathitor out is not that painful, just as it starts to hurt its over.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
28)
</strong>
Drink lots of water so you can pee. The first few times will be very messy. Wash off with the detachable shower head to avoid tearing stitches by wiping.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
29)
</strong>
Don&#39;t worry if it doesn&#39;t look pretty, it will still be very swollen and healing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
30)
</strong>
After you get the cath out, you can go to breakfast or down the street. You still can&#39;t lift more than 5 pounds or climb stairs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
31)
</strong>
Eat lots of lean protein to speed up healing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
32)
</strong>
Go slow when upgrading to the #1 dilator, it will be tight. Slowly twist it out when finished to break the suction seal.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
33)
</strong>
You will have to order more topical anesthetic jelly and Q-C before you leave, the nurses will have you fill out an order slip and bring it the day.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
34)
</strong>
On your follow up, they will remove the stitches, douche you, then check the inside with a speculum. If you have a separation they will re-stitch it or cauterize it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
35)
</strong>
If all is well you will be cleared to do more touristy stuff if you want.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
36)
</strong>
Chett will send you an email with the time your driver is picking you up to go to the airport, he will help load and unload your bags.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
37)
</strong>
Use the letter he gave you after you were discharged to get a better seat and a wheelchair. A staff member will push you through customs then to your gate and make sure you get loaded first.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
38)
</strong>
Once home, if you have any problems, you can send Chett an email with pictures.
</p>
</li>

Well done! It would help a bit if you could use some formatting to make it easier to read. There&#39;s a &#34;formattng help&#34; link at the bottom of the editing box that shows the commands. Making the titles bold would be good.

This might be a really uneducated question but the liquid-only diet, is that just because of the tracheal shave, or is it part of SRS as well?

Part of SRS. Due to them working so close to your colon you have to be completely empty before the surgery.

That makes perfect sense. Not sure why it didn&#39;t click for me. Sounds like it was worth it regardless.

Thank you for the Tips.
</p>
<p>
I have my GCS with Chett this month and I will be solo.
</p>
<p>
One thing I&#39;d like to say is that my Phone Carrier is Verizon and I will not need a SIM Card when I get to Thailand.
</p>
<p>
I use what is called the Verizon Travel Pass. Verizon Rep told me my Phone is ready. Just need to use it when in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
It makes me question why people keep saying you need a SIM Card when you really don&#39;t? Is it carrier based, phone based? Thanks
