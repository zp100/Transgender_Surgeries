Oh what a beautiful morning ðŸŽ¶ Oh what a beautiful day ðŸŽ¶ Stent removed also the catheter ðŸŽ¶ Everything&#39;s going my way ðŸŽ¶
</p>
<p>
The lumpy cucumber of discomfort and the string Bean of irrigation are gone. The relief is so significant all I can do is sing songs of joy and elation to the world around me.

I&#39;m most likely going to brassard at the end of this year and I was wondering
</p>
<ol>
<li>
did you do permanent hair removal before or follow brassard recommendation?
</li>
<li>
what was it like walking into the room to receive anesthesia?
</li>
<li>
how has the pain been so far?
</li>
</ol>

I did get perineum electrolysis done. 4 appointments. Last one around a month prior (maybe to close) only took four hours to clear the area for me as I&#39;m naturally quite hairless.
</p>
<p>
Walking into the room was intimidating. The reality of what I was doing really hit home. But I was calm. I was emotionally ready for it. The crusifiction-like surgical bed was something else. You put both arms out to either side legs into thier stirrups. I bore my own cross that day, that&#39;s for sure. Hehe
</p>
<p>
The pain is easy to manage. The day of surgery was like a 7-8 / 10. Once you get a handle on the med&#39;s effects, you can get it down to 1-3 most of the days, 5-6 is normal first in the morning. BUT that&#39;s me. Everyone experiences it differently.

Going to Brassard in the near future (I created my file at GRS but I&#39;m not 18 and it hasn&#39;t been 12 months since I&#39;ve had HRT yet, so I&#39;m gonna guess I&#39;ll get probs surgery early-mid 2021) and I&#39;ve got a couple questions?
</p>
<p>
1: Are you satisfied with how your vagina looks so far?
</p>
<p>
2: How bad is the vomiting after the surgery?
</p>
<p>
3: How has the staff been?

It does look like a vagina but with some significant scars. You&#39;re welcome to ask me how it looks just before it&#39;s your turn. From all accounts it looks good and will likely heal up cute and tidy.
</p>
<p>
My surgery was at noon. I was drinking lot of water (just in little sips) throughout that first evening. Come midnight they gave me some oxycodone and within a few mins i had to barf the whole contents of my stomach. That was the only time I got sick or even felt sick. Afterwards I felt fine and slept most of the first night away. Maybe around 5am day 1 I woke and was in a lot of pain. My room mate was blabbing away about her kink life style and it was the last thing I needed to hear. That was the peak of my pain level the whole experience.
</p>
<p>
The staff are absolutely wonderful. I&#39;ve been trying to learn all their names so as they come and go and return I can happily greet them and thank them for everything they do.

Once you have a referral and have submitted all the paperwork, it&#39;s 15 weeks to process your file, then a few weeks to get MSP funding approval (I&#39;m from BC) then 5 weeks to get the surgical date notice, surgery ( for me) was 14 weeks after that. In other words, not immediately.

Basically yes. The whole clinic shuts down for vacation from Dec 17th(ish) to Jan 15th(ish) and again July 17th(ish) to Aug 15th(ish). So add the lost month(s) to your estimates.
</p>
<p>
I finally submitted all necessary paperwork March 1st 2019 and had my surgery Jan 15th. = 10.5 months. I have an old Post here where I listed my whole submission timeline.

On your surgical date form, it says &#34;regional&#34; or &#34;general&#34;. I had regional.
</p>
<p>
After sitting on the surgical table, they First gave me some pills. Then they made me hug a pillow and gave me an epidural. This freezes the entire lower half of your body. The iv is put in as well. I&#39;m not sure if they added anything to that but while I was waiting for my legs to feel warm and tingly, I passed out apparently. Next thing I know I was waking up in the recovery room. There they do an ice test to see if you have regained feeling in your legs. It took two hours for me. Then you are moved to your hospital room.
</p>
<p>
See.. There is no such thing as a dumb question.

2-3/10 They make you stand up 16 hours after your surgery. It&#39;s very short. Just up then back down into bed. They guide you on how to scoot over to the edge by lifting yourself by the head and heels.
</p>
<p>
Next morning, aka day one, they get you out of bed again to walk one lap around the nurses station. They assist you, you hold the iv tree.
</p>
<p>
Later after naps and could and drugs etc, you can try again and walk further.
</p>
<p>
Later in the evening you can try again. Day two, more of the same. Walk around unassisted. As big as the surgery is, you are actually able to recover quite quick

No.
</p>
<p>
I arrived the 13th. Stayed at the assigned hotel for two nights.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at hospital the morning of the 15th. Surgery at noon. Then moved to hospital bed that afternoon. This is called day zero.
</p>
<p>
Days one and two are in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Day three you are moved to the recovery house which is next door but attached by a glass hallway.
</p>
<p>
Days 3-7 are spent learning to care for your surgical site.
</p>
<p>
Head home the morning of day 8. (For me, the 23rd)
