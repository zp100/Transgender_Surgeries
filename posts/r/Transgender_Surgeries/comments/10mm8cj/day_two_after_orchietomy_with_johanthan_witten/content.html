Surgery went well. I had trouble sitting up. They removed a fist sized hydrocele and a conected string of smaller cysts with the orchietomy.
</p>
<p>
Scheduling was rough, i had to call and email several times to get information plus some of my own blunders that made it difficult since i wasnt taking notes. Their office is very busy so you have to stay on top of them for paperwork, but dont let disscourage you.
</p>
<p>
Johnathan is very personable but brief, write down questions before the consulation. The surgery team was excellent. The operation was only about an hour then i was sent home.
</p>
<p>
The pain has been tolerable. Most of it in my bladder.. it was pretty full after surgery, the rest in my hips and stomach kind of similar to having cramps.
</p>
<p>
The second day has been more of the same but ive been able to walk to the bathroom without assistance a little easier. Havent showered yet. No swelling yet either
</p>
<p>
Ive really only took the oxycodone to sleep at night. It really hasnt been all that vital.

Is he still located in Kentucky? Im a therapist in KY who is trying to help some of my trans girls find a surgeon in state due to insurance requirements, but his office is very hard to get ahold of and online says he works in multiple states. Thanks and congrats on your surgery ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

Yes, he is based out of louisville but practices both through first urologies KY and IN Clinics. It is very hard to reach them  but phone is the best for the initial contact... At least that ia how i reached them.

On day 32 of my Orchiectomy, I was there not long ago. Congratulations on getting it done. Make sure not to keep the ice on too long or directly on the skin. Supportive-as-you-can underwear that holds everything well makes it so much better.

I have a consultation for GRS with him in March. Iâ€™m excited for it. Glad it went good for you. I bet youâ€™re already a lot happier.

Congratulations on your orchiectomy! I had orchiectomy and scrotum removal 5 years ago and it was the most freeing thing I ever had done to that point. It eventually created the desire to become completely Nullified, which my surgeon performed under vaginoplasty codes. Now I&#39;m truly happy and comfortable in my body and friends even tell me they see me as very happy
