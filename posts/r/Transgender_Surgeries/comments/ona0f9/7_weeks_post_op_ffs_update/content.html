Swelling got a lot better, I still have some in my forehead area, Nose, Chin and overall puffiness around my eyes but it really got so much better. As far as numbness I have some numbness on very top of my head and my lips and Chin are also still numb. But I often get a tingling sensation so I guess that‘s a good sign. Also after surgery I had more numbness on my head than I have now! The hair which has fallen out like crazy is also slowly regrowing in certain areas already. I‘m quite happy with how my nose came out since it was anything but straight from the beginning and my nose - holes are also smaller. Chin is okay but I‘m not so extremely happy with my forehead. I don‘t think I would do this surgery again even if my forehead won‘t go down any further. But I wish it looked more flat as I told my surgeon so. Maybe I needed a reconstruction instead of only shaving the bone off. Anyway, I think I gotta learn to love myself the way I look since I think we will always find something which bothers us and we aren‘t machines which u can just exchange certain features. There‘s always a risk, a long healing time and possibilities it won‘t turn out the way we wanted to. I will post pictures from my side profile before and after when I‘m a bit longer post-op.

Oh, forgot to mention that I can only raise one eyebrow (my left one) the other feels like I got botox. I hope I will be able to move the right side with time again, too. I‘m still only going out with my hat since the hair loss is too visible (bald spots).
