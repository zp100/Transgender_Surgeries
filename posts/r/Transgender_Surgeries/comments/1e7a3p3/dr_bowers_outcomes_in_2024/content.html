My partner is looking at surgery with Dr. Bowers, and I was wondering how her results stack up in 2024. Is she still growing as a surgeon? Is she comparable to other surgeons in the United States? Now that insurance coverage is a real possibility for us, we want to consider all the options.

I had PIV with Dr. Bowers on 17 January. Stayed at Mills-Peninsula Medical Centre from that Wednesday until Saturday morning (20ᵀᴴ; checked out before lunch). She and Dr. Sven Gunther work together hand-in-hand, and both are present in the OR. In the hospital, I saw Dr. Gunther daily. In-office, I saw them both; Dr. Bowers performed all follow-up examinations and procedures (granulation removal at week 12).
</p>
<p>
I was given their mobile numbers to use for questions after surgery. Because Dr. Gunther was the person I saw most in the hospital, I texted him frequently with questions, validations, and clarifications. Dr. Bowers seems to be very busy, so I didn’t bother her.
</p>
<p>
I consumed 4 litres of water alongside 85g+ of protein daily after surgery. Kept that up until my 6-monthversary. I was walking with help by day 3, on my own in flats for about 30 minutes by day 7, and on my own in heels for about an hour by day 11. Full motor capability by day 21 for about an hour at a time. The appearance is
<strong>
lovely
</strong>
. Very pretty. My husband likes the aesthetic, and my doctor thinks it looks very natural. Scarring is symmetrical and very small. I’ve never seen one before surgery, so I couldn’t possibly have an opinion of it. I have 30-foot tall mirrored walls all over my house, and occasionally dance in front of them after dilating because I can do so without dysphoria. I get giddy when I see it.
</p>
<p>
6 months later, I still have full depth (no visible dots on dilator), but I have an extremely tight neovagina. I was able to use #4 dilator (large orange) with effort before flying back for 3-month checkup, but the same day returning home, I couldn’t even fit #3 for some reason. Maybe because of flying 9 hours in one day? Not sure, but it definitely set back my comfort quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
I’m still unable to use #4 dilator as the result of vaginismus, but still working my way up with gyno and therapist. #3 dilator takes about 15 minutes to reach full depth, but is tirelessly difficult to pry out with as tight as I am. Extracting the #3 takes anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, and the dilator comes out completely dry, even when I get discouraged and pour an entire tube of lubricant inside myself. It honestly feels like I’m yanking on a suction cup that’s been super glued inside me—sound effects included, according to my husband. My gynaecologist prescribed wearable dilators that have helped tremendously.
</p>
<p>
I still have some numbness in the right inner-thigh joint and on the right side of my mons, which has taught me to press and rub scratches rather than try to scratch them with my fingernails. No wound separation at all throughout my recovery. No issues urinating. No infections. Some granulation around week 11, cleared by Dr. Bowers in-office at follow-up. Sitting upright is fairly uncomfortable—feels like I’m sitting on a tucked erection, but has gotten much better with time.
</p>
<p>
I am sex-averse, and haven’t tried having an orgasm. I opted for full-depth to accommodate my husband. Getting aroused can be a little painful still, but no one has mentioned to me whether it’s normal or not. To be honest, anything touching my clit feels like sandpaper, so I’m not interested at all. I was prescribed oestrogen cream to increase sensation and soften the irritation. It seems to be working very well, but smells horrid, so I wash 3-4 times daily while using the cream.
</p>
<p>
I am very pleased with early care, comprehensive and thorough pre-check, very clear timeline, detailed instructions (written) for post care and dilations. Hospital care was delightful (especially nurse Alexis who has a very positive, bubbly personality), and the food isn’t terrible (especially if you tell them you need a certain amount of calories or proteins ahead of time). I am exceedingly pleased with the final presentation, comfort, and functionality. If I notice anything at my one-year follow-up, I’ll definitely have it done by Dr. Bowers and/or Dr. Gunther.
</p>
<p>
I hope this helps. Good luck.
