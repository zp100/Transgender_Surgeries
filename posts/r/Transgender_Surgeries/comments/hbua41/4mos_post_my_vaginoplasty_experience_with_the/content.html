I promised myself I&#39;d do this, since it was such a pain not being able to find much about this surgeon&#39;s office. And sorry, but no pictures. I just don&#39;t really wanna, and frankly it&#39;s going to depend on your body type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Background:
</strong>
Just for comparison&#39;s sake. I am 29, in fairly good shape, and was about 5&#39;8&#34;/180lbs. at the time of surgery. Been on HRT for four years this week, full-time significantly longer.
<em>
Extremely
</em>
bad genital dysphoria as early as three or so and was able to feel really strong phantom sensations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Pre-Consult:
</strong>
I first tried to go through a different surgeon throughout 2018. So I already had the weight loss I needed to do out of the way and had been doing a consistent yoga routine with a bunch of prenatal stuff alongside regular kegels. That shit helps yo, do it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Consults:
</strong>
June 2019. Went up to KC to meet the first of the team. Meridith Gray (Gynecology). Yes, like the TV doctor which I find hilarious. Dr. Gray was very knowledgeable and friendly but it was mostly stuff I was ready for. It took a bit to get scheduled but once my insurance cleared and the date was set for Feb/2020 the other consults were booked. Yes,
<strong>
consults.
</strong>
KUMC uses a three-surgeon team, all pulled from the relevant departments. I like it, Dr. Ponooru (Plastic Surgery) has great bedside manner and Dr. Broghammer (Urology) actually knew stuff I didn&#39;t about long-term expectations. Good team, and they compliment each other well. It was a pain though to have to go all the way up there for three consults and a pre-op testing appointment. Biggest complaint of the few I have, it was a 4hr. drive one way. But they are in network for Ambetter insurance in Arkansas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Big Day:
</strong>
Things went smooth. One thing I really liked about this location is that you really are just another patient in the Gynecology Wing. Might be a little more dysphoria inducing for transmascs, and some people might prefer an experience very centered around catering to trans folk...but I liked how normal it all felt. I checked in, went back, the three surgeons popped in and on the last one they slipped the first anesthetic in the IV. I was out before they wheeled me out of the room. I woke up later in the recovery room and the nurse told me everything went well. And I got to spook her with how quickly I snap out of anesthesia, which is fun.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Hospital Stay:
</strong>
Yo, this part was rad. Gynecology wing so it&#39;s super nice. Private room that was big enough for my Dad to stay comfortably as well and the food was good. The nurses were all sweet too, only had one minor issue with the catheter bag getting screwed up but that normal. That said, it is a teaching hospital. You&#39;re gonna have to deal with med students doing rounds with Dr. Gray. I never saw the other two surgeons since. They more or less just do their part of the operation and leave the rest to her.
</p>
<p>
Hospital stay was two days, with a 1wk followup from the surgery date. So I had to stay in the area for a bit. The KC area has a chain called Extended Stay America that is cheap and has in-room kitchens, etc. Good option here. Those days suuuuucked though. The pain wasn&#39;t awful, but I do have a pretty damn high pain tolerance so take that with a grain of salt. The catheter was awful though. Annoyed the hell out of me. I was able to move around fairly well and eventually shower by Saturday, but take it easy and count on your buddy. You need someone with you.
</p>
<p>
The next Tuesday we were back at the Drs. Office for the followup. Enter Nurse Peggy, one of my new favorite people on the planet. That chick knows
<em>
so
</em>
much about vaginas. Here they take the packing out, and first dilation. Also worth noting she picked at a small blood clot on my new labia and commented how great it was I could feel her touch it. Shit was soooooo swollen. Like two bananas between my legs. Then we drove 4hrs. back. That was awful.
</p>
<p>
For what it&#39;s worth, the dilation schedule:
</p>
<p>
4/day, 20min each for three weeks
</p>
<p>
3/day, 20min each for three weeks
</p>
<p>
2/day, 20min each for three weeks
</p>
<p>
1/day, 20min each for three weeks
</p>
<p>
and you have multiple sizes of dilators and all that they&#39;ll go over. There&#39;s no real instruction there beyond listen to your body. The first night was rough and I bled a bit. There&#39;s this like, hole that opens up below the neovagina that&#39;s normal but look scary as fuck. From the second day on though it wasn&#39;t bad and got easier. Of the four dilators they give you they say you won&#39;t need to use the biggest and shouldn&#39;t expect it, but I can. Depth stayed pretty consistent too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
2 Week:
</strong>
Still swollen and bruised as hell but starting to actually look like a vulva. KC and back for a followup was the worst part of all of this but by that point I was also off the narcotic pain meds. Honestly should have gone ahead and taken 1-2 of the ones I had left. Had to move slow and didn&#39;t have much stamina, but I could get around.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
1 Month:
</strong>
Starting to look alright, but still incredibly bruised. Dilation getting easier, using the 2nd smallest one regularly. A lot less messy by this point. I don&#39;t ever want to hear another TERF say I don&#39;t know how much of a pain it is to deal with periods is all I&#39;ll say there. I started working part-time again, physical labor too and it wasn&#39;t much of a problem as long as I didn&#39;t push myself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
3 Months:
</strong>
The biggest jump was probably the biggest so far. Should have had a 6wk followup in KC, but COVID. We did a telehealth appointment at 10wks. Once again, Nurse Peggy is awesome. By that point I had a lot more of a clear idea what to be asking about and it all seemed like normal stuff to her.
</p>
<p>
Work and getting back to Yoga are fine. I couldn&#39;t quite push myself too much, but things were mostly back to normal by now. Still haven&#39;t had sex yet, but could if I wanted to. Masturbation is pretty damn fun. Don&#39;t even have that much trouble getting fairly wet. Probably not enough for penetration without lube, but definitely enough to finger myself without it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
4 Months:
</strong>
Mostly cosmetic improvements between now and three months. Still bruised and the labia minora haven&#39;t fully emerged because of the last bit of swelling. The incision lines are visible but not that much. Very sensitive, not too many issues with it wanting to make a mess peeing. And even with the world falling to shit, I feel pretty damn good personally.
</p>
<p>
So all told, I&#39;d recommend KUMC. They&#39;re in that nice middle ground between trained in the newest methods but still having some experience under their belt. I was skeptical of them reporting quicker recovery times than normal but it holds up in my case.

I think the idea is TERFs use periods as a &#34;look how much I go through as a woman!!&#34;, and OP is saying dilation is just as much of a PITA to deal with?

That first month I pretty much had to have a pad down there most of the time because of bleeding, discharge, etc. from healing. It&#39;s messy, I didn&#39;t want to dwell on it much, and it was mostly clearing up by the first month. More a tongue-in-cheek comment about that than any relation to dilation.

I uses to live in Kansas. I couldn&#39;t come to terms with myself until I moved away from my family to another state. I came out as trans and been on horomones 2 years. Maybe I need to move back so i can have my surgery at the KUMC.

I&#39;m still trying to find someone to do that surgury where they use part of your intestine as the lining of your new vagina. Mostly because I don&#39;t want to have to dialate all the time.

Dilation essentially the use of a medical grade stint to prevent the new vagina from both closing and losing depth , you are not using it like a sex toy but are pushing it in as far as comfortable for you a little at a time and holding it there for a prescribed amount of time several times a day , i have not had srs yet but have a friend who has  Phylis💞

Depends on a lot of things like what kind of surgery you get, if there’s any complications, and just plain old luck. Typically you have to do it less over time, and some people I hear use PIV sex as a substitute after a while

No problem. I know how much I&#39;d have liked to see something like this beforehand.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, like I said at the top I had super bad bottom dysphoria from the outset, so I definitely needed this to get done. And the relief is immeasurable. World is going to shit, I even have a pretty nasty family trauma going on...but I still haven&#39;t slept this well in 20+ years.

Hi! Can you share your &#34;yoga, prenatal stuff and kegels&#34; routine for pre-op girls?
</p>
<p>
I had to pospone my SRS due to COVID so I&#39;ve got time to work out and improve my future healing.

Kegels...just Google something that sounds doable. My therapist had me doing a deep breathing exercise and incorporated kegel exercises into it.
</p>
<p>
As for Yoga? Look up these poses, do one side and then the other holding each one as long as it&#39;s comfortable:

Oh, my gosh, FINALLY someone posting about their experience at KUMC. I have my surgery with them scheduled for July 21st and I&#39;m super excited - less than four weeks to go. I sadly was originally scheduled for April 22nd and it was cancelled due to COVID. Your experience really made me feel better about when I check in to the hospital. I was scared I would have to be rolled into their OR while still conscious.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can&#39;t tell you how every hen savar was about going with KU Med since I couldn&#39;t find information about them. I will say, I respect your choice to not share photos but it is also extremely disappointing being that nobody else has shared. I&#39;ve been making video journals so far leading up to the big day and I plan to do so.
</p>
<p>
Couple questions for you:
</p>
<p>
1) From the moment you arrived at the hospital and when the three doctors finally popped in, how long was that?
</p>
<p>
2) If you God forbid went through it again, what would you do differently?
</p>
<p>
3) Was there any special favors you asked of the team? I asked if I could see my testicles following the surgery and I was told they would actually consider it.
</p>
<p>
4) What things were done the week following and once you checked-in? Did they draw blood, check your vitals, etc?
</p>
<p>
Ugh, I feel like I have a billion other questions. Could we please DM?

Good luck! I’m their first August surgery, on the 25th. Looking forward to hearing how yours goes. Agree with it being hard to find much about the KUMC results but I’ve found a few IRL and they are all extremely satisfied!

That&#39;s neat, so you&#39;re basically the next surgery after me. The biggest concern I told Dr. Ponnuru during my consult was I need to have adequate vulva. It&#39;s my number one thing I hope for with my results.

He was so sweet when I met with him! When he did the visual inspection he felt I’d have plenty to work with and I’ve definitely had some atrophy. Soon we will be free girly 💖

Sadly because my original surgery was scheduled for April, they did my consult back in the beginning of April and that was when they were just beginning to cancel elective surgeries. So my consults with both Dr. Ponnuru and Dr. Broghammer were switched to telehealth. They have yet to do a visual inspection and have told me that they are not concerned with doing one which really makes me wonder. My only concern is that my hair removal hasn&#39;t been enough, which to add salt to injury, COVID ended up setting my hair removal appointments back. I can&#39;t tell you how much I hope it isn&#39;t an issue for me or that they won&#39;t get me in that OR and then all of a sudden decide that I&#39;m not ready. I don&#39;t know what I would do if this surgery did not happen on July 21st. I was mentally destroyed for a week when my first surgery was canceled. Everything going on with this pandemic and nervousness about the surgery has made my weight management extremely difficult. I am literally sitting at the maximum weight I was told was acceptable for the surgery, which only makes me all the more nervous.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m so out of my mind nervous and scared of this operation, but I don&#39;t see a life in front of me without it happening. It also doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;ve had a lot of transphobic garbage going on around me lately, several people passing me by calling me a man and telling me I&#39;m a fake. It really steals any joy a girl can have about even remotely living as her true self. I even had a guy last night asked me out on a date and then just seconds later tell me he had to cancel because he was not into trans girls. I don&#39;t identify with the trans label and I hope this doesn&#39;t follow me around for the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for my kind of rant there, today has been very difficult for me. I hope you and myself the best.

Always okay to express fear. I’ve got the same fear with hair. I’ll have most likely 20 hours done. I know a lot of girls who did a lot less and never had any issues post-op, including KU girls.

I am scared of cancellation. When everything was happening I left a call for Judy asking for a hard honest truth if she thought it would get cancelled. I still remember my voice cracking and trying not to break down sobbing at the thought.

<p>
I’m so fucking ready to not have this fucking thing on my body.

I&#39;m sorry it took me a minute to get back to you, and yes. Feel free to DM. Once again, might take me a bit but I will remember to check eventually.

They told me to check in at 6:00, I want to say the operation proper was underway by 8:15. Woke back up finally around 2:00 in the afternoon. With the caveat that I shake of anesthesia super fast.

Hmmm...for sure I&#39;d have gotten a few cheap pairs of pajama pants a size too big for the days with the catheter. One&#39;s you&#39;re cool throwing out since they&#39;ll get nasty. Ask me that again when you get closer.

Nah, and that&#39;s awesome.

Vitals, removed packing, lecture and first dilation. I don&#39;t think they drew blood but it&#39;s hard to remember.

Might I ask, how long did it take you to get that first consultation with the surgeon? And how long after the first consultation was the date set? I&#39;ll be setting up the consultation in mid-september and I&#39;m trying to figure out how the timeframe will be.

I only live 50 minutes from KU, and one of my friends knows one of the surgeons there directly; it&#39;s nice to know that there is a good surgeon so close.
