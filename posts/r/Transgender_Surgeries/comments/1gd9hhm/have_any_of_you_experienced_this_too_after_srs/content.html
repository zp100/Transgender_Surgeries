So when I came back home from the hospital a week after the intervention, I had lost weight from basically not having much of an appetite after the surgery and how much the hospital food sucked. I think I was about 54.5 kg (120 lbs) by that time, while I was usually between 56-57kg beforehand (123-125 lbs).
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;ve been home for like a month and a half and I&#39;m eating regularly and as I did before, but I just can&#39;t seem to put on weight and in fact I just weighed myself and the scale says 54kg (119 lbs) ðŸ˜­.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone had this happen and knows why?
</p>
<p>
(for reference I&#39;m 170cm tall, or 5&#39;7)

No personal experience, but you&#39;re using up a lot of your energy atm just on healing. I&#39;d advise upping your food intake if you can, especially protein, if this is worrying you.

This is the answer OP. General wisdom is to try and double your calories for a bit post SRS.

Gotta agree. Former part nutrition major. All bodies are different to be sure but the old school rule of thumb would have you weighing around 135 for your height. You are definitely burning calories to heal things. Youâ€™ve gotta give your body the fuel it needs to build the new bridges etc where itâ€™s healing. If youâ€™re just no5 hungry try adding an ensure or other complete nutrition protein forward shake. Ps best of luck and keep us ll updated.

I lost weight for similar reasons. Plus, had complications due to outlying health issues.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m two months out and still no food sounds good and I&#39;ve been sick a lot.

As another commenter said, your body is using a lot of energy trying to heal right now. You need to be eating enough everyday for your body to heal and for you to have energy. There is a calculation for how much you should be eating but I can&#39;t remember what that is, my nurse went through it with me during pre assessment.
</p>
<p>
Also worth noting that weight gain (or lack of) can be related to hormone levels, after a major surgery like this they can take time to settle. It can take a little while for your body to get back to its usual rhythm so you may have to be patient with it. At times I had to force myself to eat something because I had little appetite, par for the course i guess. Also remember to weigh yourself at the same time of day (preferably first thing in the morning after going to the toilet) so that it is accurate.

Had the same situation. It was about 6 weeks after surgery before my weight started normalizing.

I lost a fair bit of weight post op.
</p>
<p>
Went from 76.5KG to 68KG.
</p>
<p>
Although I think there is a lack of weight training in the gym. And walking every day while healing helped.

I actually gained a fair amount of weight, food at the hospital was surprisingly good and I could order anything pretty much at any time. When I got out of the hospital and into my hotel for two weeks I was just ordering in food on delivery apps or going to restaurants, maybe I was just eating out of boredom so now 2 months after surgery I&#39;m working on losing all the extra lbs ðŸ˜…
