I just had a Peritoneal Pull through revision with Dr. Pariser and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! I had Dr. Gray at KU do my original penile inversion surgery in 2021 and I was completely botched. Peggy did not want to admit I had issues and played it off and kept telling me my Urethra was my canal and that I was extremely tight. Dr. Stacker said the same and started prescribing Xanax and nothing changed plus 10 other meds. I soon lbrought my bf in and he explained that to enter my vaginal canal you had to go straight down and then up past the pelvic bone like a V. 3 years of dicking with them and them saying it was psychological and that I would have to live that way for the rest of my life. After I kept complaining until they did two episiotomy‚Äôs because then enterance was too high and when I would be sitting on a tolit and then I would start pissing down my leg is completely not normal but they said it was. They finally did two episiotomy‚Äôs and then they agreed that they found the scar tissue but they couldn‚Äôt find it before because the entrance was too high up. I went to Rush university and the Surgeon there refused to touch me from how bad my surgery was. Then I seen Dr. Pariser and he was very happy to take me on as a patient and he fixed almost all of the problems I was having . Now when I dilate it does not feel like glass and the dilator goes straight in. Next year is my second revision to fix the rest of my first botched surgery.

I just had my consult. He trained under Kim before Kim left. I really enjoyed my consult and the information he provided. His main nurse is actually non binary which was really nice and overall great information and waiting for my hair removal to be done so I can book my date!

I had my orchie with him in August. Obviously less substantial than vaginoplasty, though.
</p>
<p>
He was fine. Once he found out I was gonna get FFS with Rolfes, he wouldn&#39;t stop talking about him, and that was a bit weird.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not trying to give a glowing or scathing review of him. I think he was adequate. If you&#39;re specifically trying to be local, I think he&#39;s a fine choice
