Does anyone have a packing list of things I should bring with me to Thailand and things to buy once I’m there? I’m a bit lost on this and I feel like I’m not prepared at all!
</p>
<p>
Going to Chettawut in 8 days, surgery in 14.

I just got back this past weekend. Feel free to ask me anything. Here are some things that we packed:
</p>
<ul>

Colace (or similar stool softener) - The drugs they give you make you constipated. These will help
</li>
<li>
Dresses
</li>
<li>
Duster
</li>
<li>
Comfy Shorts
</li>
<li>
PJs
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Socks
</li>
<li>
Robe
</li>
<li>
Sandals
</li>
<li>
Advil/Ibuprofun
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, etc)
</li>
<li>
Entertainment (laptop, switch, kindle, etc)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Things to buy once you get there:
</p>
<p>
I stayed in the Dusit Princess. You’ll only have a kettle and a mini fridge as far as kitchen essentials go. Some easy “meals” I ended up making: * Miso Soup (Super necessary for the bowel cleanse process) * If you don’t have a chance to buy this on your own the hotel can provide it and it’s literally called &#34;Operation Soup&#34;. * Ramen, Bok Choy, Carrots * Fruit, Cheese, Prosciutto, Bagel Chips * PB&amp;J * Meat &amp; Cheese Sandwiches * Hummus, Tomato, Turkey, Lettuce pita pockets * Apples &amp; Peanut Butter * Cereal
</p>
<p>
In order to make better hotel room soup I chopped all my veggie and put them in a bowl with dried ramen and the seasoning, boiled the kettle and poured the hot water over everything then covered the bowl with a plate for 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Pack a fuck ton of things you’ll actually want to eat after surgery. The first day you’re back at the hotel (until the packing comes out) you’re on a soft foods diet. So think soft granola bars (bonus points if they’re high in fiber), instant oatmeal packs, etc. Breakfast is free for you to order at the hotel but all other meals are on your dime.
</p>
<p>
The hotel is right next to a MASSIVE shopping mall, Seacon. If you need food the entire top floor is restaurants (though there’s food throughout the entire mall). There is a Tops (grocery store) on the basement floor. You go in the entrance closest to the hotel. Just passed the food court is an elevator down and it looks like you&#39;re going into the mattress department at Macy&#39;s. You take a left and walk towards electronics and then make a right and you&#39;ll see all the groceries. It&#39;s a very strange setup.
</p>
<p>
Go to Daiso. It’s in Seacon, in the center of mall on the 2nd floor. You can get a soup bowl, plate, spoon, cutting board, knife, etc. Most importantly you can get a tray to eat food in bed or set your laptop on and it’s all super cheap.
</p>
<p>
Download the Grab app. It’s like Uber, UberEats, and Prime Now all in one. You can order food, groceries, and get a ride at a set price instead of worrying with taxis running the meter. Not all of the restaurants have their menu in English so you’ll have to hunt a little bit. We ended up ordering from Ippudo (Ramen) and Terrace (Thai) both were really good.

1) A person - Trust me, you’ll need a LOT of assistance after the surgery. This is the most important thing to bring with you lol you can forget about anything else as long as you have someone coming with you.
</p>
<p>
2) Underwear - at least 7 of them.
</p>
<p>
3) Plug converter
</p>
<p>
4) Comfortable dresses and skirts.
</p>
<p>
And other things I can’t think of right now.

I had my surgery with Dr. Chettawut two years ago- message me if you have any questions. I’m sure it will go splendidly.

Would you mind updating this post with what you actually took with you to Thailand and what was useful or not?
