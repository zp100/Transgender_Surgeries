I figured I would make a post because Dr.Figler is relatively new, and hopefully putting more information out there will make some people less hesitant in the future!
</p>
<p>
To start off, the process leading up to the surgery was smooth, with no real hiccups. Dr.Figler seemed incredibly passionate about his work and developing newer techniques to give better aesthetic results. Worth noting that there weren&#39;t pictures of results with this procedure when I met, but there are now I&#39;ve been told by someone who met with him 2 days ago.
</p>
<p>
Surgery went fine, and they told me no complications (which was true at the time). However, later the day of surgery in the hospital I had intense pain (I needed two hits of morphine), and they came in. And put some gauze to increase pressure to reduce some swelling in my public mound. This fixed the pain, and I was able to walk the next day, and was discharged on the following day. The following few days with the catheter went totally fine.
</p>
<p>
When I got the catheter out, they told me that I had a hematoma on my public mound, and to keep an eye on it. Long story short one kind of scary stressful, and a little bloody week later, and I come in to start dilation and we can&#39;t because the hematoma was still very large and pushing into my vaginal canal. We decided to have surgery the next day to drain it so I could recovery normally, as it&#39;s a very minor thing in the grand scheme of things, but would require an outpatient surgery to fix.
</p>
<p>
After I got it drained besides fresh surgery pain I already felt better, and was then healing normally. This time my healing process was great, a week after getting my hematoma drained I was already driving too and walking around the whole mall again.
</p>
<p>
Went back a week after getting drained and Dr.Figler and every person he brought in said everything looked to be healing amazing now, and that I didn&#39;t need to see them again for 6 weeks. My physical therapy appointment was 2 days ago, and again my physical therapist said everything looked great.
</p>
<p>
This was also when I learned to dilate, so about 9 days late. Fortunately, I&#39;ve already been able to dilate 5 dots which was a stretch goal because I&#39;m tiny, and it already doesn&#39;t have a ton discomfort and has a portion literally slipping in already! Also with the scrotal graft dilating only twice a day for 30 minutes is needed.
</p>
<p>
As for aesthetics it&#39;s hard to tell, my healing was a bit delayed, and it&#39;s still a bit swollen with incision lines and such, but all the medical staff I&#39;ve seen say it should look amazing, although a bit asymmetrical, possibly due to the hematoma. Though this may also change with time.
</p>
<p>
Final note is that dr.figler has seen me at every visit post op but 1, including 2 during the week I had the hematoma and was freaking out. He has been there every step of the way and the staff is also amazing with responding to messages through their portal.
</p>
<p>
This was probably super wordy, but I hope it was helpful, and if anyone has any questions I can answer them the best I can. And I will probably post pics at around 2 months. Thanks!

Thanks for this. I have a follow up with him around the end of the year once hair removal is done. Hoping for a surgery date in the spring. When I met him he seemed very nice and even when he examined me at the consult he verbalized what he was doing and asked consent to touch me. Super impressed with that.
</p>
<p>
He said he has done maybe 60 of these but with his experience in genital reconstruction, that has put me at ease. Just wish he had pictures up. I&#39;ve yet to find any. Looking forward to hearing of your recovery. Heal well!

Thank you for sharing your experience! I have a consult with Figler in June. Did you have the &#34;graft vaginoplasty&#34; I have seen others mention?

So happy you had a great experience.  I had my surgery with him in February and besides an emergency revision due to severe hyper granulation tissue removal my surgery and experience was pretty amazing! I see him in November to talk about labiaplasty and minor revisions ( He prefers a larger clitoris for optimum sensation and labiaplasty for better cosmetic result so I agreed with possible revision) and baybay let me tell you the orgasms are so good I almost donâ€™t care about a revision ðŸ˜‚. I hope you love your new kitty !!! ðŸ–¤
