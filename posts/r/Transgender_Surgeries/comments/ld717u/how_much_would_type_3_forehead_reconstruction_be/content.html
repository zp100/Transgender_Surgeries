That&#39;ll be the same thing, but there might also be charges on top of that for the hospital and the anaesthetist etc.
</p>
<p>
Have you looked at Dr Maini and Dr Altman at Nuffield Hospital in Brighton? They offer exactly the same operation, and they are HIGHLY experienced (probably the leading UK, or even European, surgeons for this technique) whereas Inglefield does a wide range of different surgeries including GRS.

Yes, I had FFS with them just before Christmas. Maini did the actual operation with Altman assisting and Altman did the post-op stuff. I&#39;d certainly consider them. Altman is (I think) Director of Medicine now for a whole NHS trust but he&#39;s still keeping his hand in with surgery when he gets a chance - he&#39;s extremely experienced and has been working with Maini for many years, and Maini is starting to take over the FFS lead from him.
</p>
<p>
From my personal experience, Dr Maini&#39;s work is excellent, I&#39;m delighted with the brow work in particular, and the recovery was very fast and the scarring very neat and minimalised.
</p>
<p>
Inglefield is also a very experienced surgeon, and his genital work is well respected, but he seems to be more expensive than other surgeons for this.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s nothing to be lost from talking to both, and you may be able to get a better price this way too.

I had my surgery with Altman at Brighton just over two years ago and very, very happy with my results. That was when he was working by himself. If he&#39;s supervising the new guy then it&#39;s probably still worth a consult. I didn&#39;t need type 3 though.

If you had the surgery within the last 5 years you probably had Dr Maini as Dr Altman&#39;s assistant for the surgery, that&#39;s how long they&#39;ve been working together.
</p>
<p>
Also the Nuffield Hospital in Brighton is LOVELY!

Nuffield is definitely nice and the staff are really friendly. Had a room with a sea view looking out over the South Downs for both FFS and when back for GRS.

I think Inglefield has the aesthetic eye and is more experienced than Altman&#39;s predecessor. He also operates in one of the prestigious private hospitals in London so I&#39;d say go see him for a consult.
