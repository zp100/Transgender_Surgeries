17 months post op vaginoplasty and need advice.
</p>
<p>
I have what&#39;s probably going to be my last consultation with a surgeon from the same hospital tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
I have had significant pain in my groin crease that started a few days post op. The surgeon originally said it was from the lithotomy position then he said femoral nerve damage then sacral root pain that &#34;would hopefully resolve without further intervention&#34;. It has not and I&#39;m on neuropathic pain medication to manage it.
</p>
<p>
Is it because the spermatic cord was not cut properly or something else ?
</p>
<p>
I have had enough of dealing with it. Side effects of pain medication are not acceptable including no sexual sensation.
</p>
<p>
I just want want it to not hurt and to be able to feel something nice again.
</p>
<p>
Would completely removing the skin tube  help?
</p>
<p>
Any advice appreciated x

You may have suffered nerve damage from the position you were in during hours of surgery. You might want to consider seeing a neurologist for the pain as nerve pain is what they do. Itâ€™s not about your spermatic cord.

It was only 75 minutes rather than hours.
</p>
<p>
Seen a pain specialist, all they can do is give me pain medication. If I stop taking it for more than a couple of days the pain comes back.

Sorry to hear that. I wish you much love, peace and recovery. I would cuddle you if I could and will hold you in my heart.
