So, as the title says, at ~3.5mo post-op and have been feeling let down in terms of results and some minor complications. I&#39;m trying to stay optimistic as I know I still have some time until things are fully settled, and want to see how things are around the 6mo mark.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, one of the biggest issues has been remaining erectile tissue in my left labia, as pictured near the end. This has added a LOT of dysphoria around sexual things as whenever I get aroused, I essentially &#34;get hard&#34; in that area. It feels gross and it makes me immensely insecure about engaging in sexual encounters despite feeling the relief of no longer having a penis. The current plan is to discuss revision options about this around the 5-6mo mark.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, as far as aesthetics, I&#39;m feeling very conflicted as I guess I expected things to look a lot different around this time. My clitoris was unfortunately covered up during the initial healing process by the skin fusing over it. I can still interact with it, but I&#39;m not particularly happy with that. May also fix this during a revision. Additionally, whenever I open my legs, my labia feel too far apart and it makes it look very strange to me when viewing it straight on. When I&#39;m standing or sitting, it looks fine and doesn&#39;t bother me. Also, things still feel very rigid so far. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a lot of long term swelling, but it sucks not being able to like, play around with myself when I want to masturbate. Things just feel stiff and not super enjoyable to interact with.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I&#39;m grateful that I no longer have my prior equipment, but it seems I&#39;ve run into a new layer of dysphoria I didnt think existed. And that&#39;s mainly feeling like my vagina is so different than other natal/neo-vaginas... it&#39;s made this healing process very difficult to enjoy or feel good about so far. Not to mention the other stress that life has been putting me through.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to ask any questions.

This is a reposting from back in March of 2023. I&#39;m primarily doing this as I wanted to separate my other account from surgery related things. Thanks!

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/11iarhy/35mo_postop_w_dr_hyer_feeling_conflicted_lately/" rel="nofollow">original post.</a>
</p>
<p>
Edit: This was the last post I made in relation to my surgery journey. I&#39;m approaching 8 months now, and have a revision set for Aug. 1st with Dr. Hyer to address my covered clitoris and the erectile tissue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m planning on making a new post to show where I&#39;m at currently in the coming days, and then another one for post-revision. As well as a potential final post once I&#39;m fully recovered from that/my 1 year post-op. Time will tell.
</p>
<p>
I hope my posts have been informative to anyone interested in Dr. Hyer. I think at this point, I can safely say that had I had more resources available to me at the time, I would&#39;ve gone with a separate surgeon as I haven&#39;t fully been enjoying my results or the method that I went with, being PI. I think I would&#39;ve preferred PPT, and may get a revision for that much later on when I&#39;m really healed up and feel ready to undergo another surgery.

The good news is that it seems to be healing well.  Revisions are pretty typical.   I do think I would seek a different surgeon for revision.

Could you try cosmetic tattooing perhaps to fix the colouration?
