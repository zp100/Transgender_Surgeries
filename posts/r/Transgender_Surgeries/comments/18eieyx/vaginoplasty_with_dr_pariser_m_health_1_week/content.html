I had surgery about 5 years ago and Dr. Pariser was part of the team. He stopped by my room most days while I was in the hospital, which is more than I could say for the lead surgeon at the time. I am so happy to see that hi has fully embraced the lead now and is doing great work!

First, yes, the team at M Health is AMAZING. I had my FFS, B.A. there this year, and in February, I am having minimal depth vaginoplasty with Dr Pariser..69 days from now to be exact.. What was your surgery day like as in check on time and other details of surgery day that really never gets mentioned..

I had to be at the hospital at 5:30 AM. I was able to check in right away. You go upstairs to check in again. Once you&#39;ve completed your second check-in, you hang out in a family lounge/waiting area. There are board games, TVs, and other hospitalities available. I waited until 7:30ish before being brought back.
</p>
<p>
Once you get brought back, they encourage you to use the bathroom one last time, even if you don&#39;t feel the need to go. Then, they will take your vitals, get you in a gown, and have you use some shower wipes to &#34;bathe&#34; one more time before surgery. You&#39;ll meet the nurses assisting the surgery, the anesthesiologist, the CRNA, and finally, Dr. Pariser will come in to chat. This all went by pretty fast.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll then wake up in the PACU where they will give you IV dilauded/fentanyl on request. They will also give you ice chips per request. They have you lying on a bed that is NOT comfortable, but once you get to your room, the bed is far more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
Once in your room, you may feel ready to eat because it&#39;s been so long since you last ate. Some people don&#39;t feel hungry. However, you can only eat ice, pudding, or Jell-O. I was starving, so I ate one of each, lol. Then, you&#39;ll likely be so tired that you&#39;ll pass right out.

Thanks for posting. I&#39;m scheduled Monday morning w/ Dr Pariser for minimal depth myself. I&#39;m so glad to hear from other patients of Dr Pariser and about their treatment and recovery.
</p>
<p>
What was the most surprising part of your experience? What did you wish you had known or done before the surgery?

I was surprised at how well managed the pain was. How much more mobile I was compared to what I had expected. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I wasn&#39;t super mobile, but far more than I had anticipated.
</p>
<p>
I wish I had brought more things to do. I didn&#39;t expect to be in a place where I could get bored. I thought I was gonna be out for days. But I wasn&#39;t, and I ended up getting super bored and lonely. I did have a good number of visitors, but I still got super lonely, especially at night.

Thanks for sharing your experience! My wife is going through electrolysis and hopefully she’ll be getting surgery with Dr Pariser in about a year from now! So your info is comforting for the both of us.
</p>
<p>
How is your recovery going? And how soon were you able to be on your feet and walking around after the surgery? When did you finally get to eat real food?
</p>
<p>
Thanks!

How is your recovery progressing? I&#39;m slated for PPT with Pariser and I&#39;m just a nervous wreck about what if I&#39;ve picked the wrong surgeon etc. If you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d love to hear about how happy you are with your result, functionality, aesthetics et.c
