To let it secondary heal and keep an eye that it&#39;s healing nicely. To also maintain dialation I talk to him again on the 17th. As he is away this week. He is insisting on us discussing weekly and me sending photo updates to grs Montreal.
</p>
<p>
He said the graft was a piece that didn&#39;t adhere. It happens. To watch my dialation to see if any changes. But there have not been any or they happened before the piece fell out.

Thanks for your post.
</p>
<p>
You said you&#39;re back on injections, this is around 3 weeks after surgery I guess.  What were you doing between surgery and now? What did they tell you to do before surgery for hormones?  Was your normal dosage any different than what you&#39;re restarting with?

My normal dosage is what I restarted at. 4mg week 100mg progesterone.  I also got offered testosterone gel for libido if I need but declined so far.
</p>
<p>
I could of started a week after surgery but I was just mentally not feeling it.  They had told me to stop hormones due to the rules.  1 month prior to surgery
</p>
<p>
But after showing them WPATH and new SOC that hormone stoppage for surgery is not mandatory they updated there site to say you don&#39;t have to stop hormones for surgery.
</p>
<p>
That was also a sorta blow to my drive to do some things. As I had asked multiple weeks prior to going for surgery and was told no. Must stop hormones.
</p>
<p>
Edit; I waited till after my local GP visit about hormones which was 2 weeks after surgery and they said we would monitor levels and make changes as we need over the course of the year. Why I waited 3 weeks.
