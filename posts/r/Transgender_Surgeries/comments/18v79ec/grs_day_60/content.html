Hi there! I’m on 7 week after surgery and I’m feeling exhausted. Some days I’m felling better but some days I’m tired and I feel the swollen down there. I’m still having blood discharge especially after dilatation (not a lot of blood, but I’ve found that I hate blood). Thank god I had 3 orgasms, so my vagina is alive. It’s normal feeling like this? My surgeon told me is everything ok at last check up 10 days ago and he wants meet me again in 3 months. Said bleeding is normal for my wound dehiscence.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I’m currently on day 53

Orgasms surgery?  Didn&#39;t realized 5gT was possible thought the nerve endings would be still mending. What&#39;s it like compared pre surgery.   Iam conflicted about using GRS mostly it&#39;s fear of losing all sensation down there and not being deep enough.  I like feeling organs so I don&#39;t want to sacrifice all that. But at the same I still want to become whole as a female.  Currently in my 9th month in hrt

I was afraid too, basically while I dilatate I feel like I wanted to have an orgasm so I try to move gentle my hands near my clitoris and I had half an orgasm. The next dilatation session I tried again (very gentle and without touching directly my clitoris and moving my fingers around) and I had an orgasm exactly like before surgery. My fear before surgery was to not reach orgasm by myself but I found it’s easy like before.

I had the most powerful orgasm of my life (by at least a multiple of 10) 27 hours after surgery from gently squeezing the surgical packing learning how to gently push and pull with my vagina.  It was like the biggest hottest fire I&#39;ve ever been near in real life was coursing, no, radiating through my whole body, I couldn&#39;t think, it was like I was on another planet.

My body has only gotten more sensitive and more and more nerve endings wake up all the time.  I know I have fewer than before, but them being in an arrangement that makes sense to my brain makes them far more effective. I&#39;m sure there is some YMMV.  I was one of those people who, not just felt distressed by her old parts, but where her brain just literally couldn&#39;t understand what was there, like someone had just grafted on a dead alien organ.
