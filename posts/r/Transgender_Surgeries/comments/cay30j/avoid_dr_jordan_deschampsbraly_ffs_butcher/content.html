These are pretty serious allegations against one of the more respected US surgeons. Do you mind offering a bit more context to help us understand? What is your background? What did you have done? What do you specifically have issues with? How long ago did you have your surgery?

Currently 23, had surgery with him in 2016 which according to other comments here, I was one of the earlier clients after Dr. O left the practice to him. He did tell me after I came out of surgery that Dr. O came by but didn’t supervise the surgery.
</p>
<p>
He disclosed the information about his general clientele after saying the potential challenges with ethnic noses, African Americans in particular.
</p>
<p>
Had nose, jaw, trachea, and chin done with some fat grafting to cheeks and lips. Allowed the surgery to heal and went back a month ago to address concerns about crooked jawline and chin squareness that returned which he verified.
</p>
<p>
Since I’ve had the surgery, I have gone to three other surgeons for breast augmentation and butt/hip augmentation (Dr. Chow, Dr. Stanton, Dr. Sejal Patel) and each praised the nose but made comments about my jaw and the overall aging affects his work had on my face with overfilling of facial fat.
</p>
<p>
I have a long term family connection with Dr. Chow and followed through with breast augmentation and trust his advice.
</p>
<p>
Deschamps had a huge ego trip when I suggested a second round of FFS to correct it.
</p>
<p>
His assistant, Yana refused to send me the before and after photos since, with the exception of my nose, I look practically identical in. I guess that’s the kind of customer service you get for that price tag. His new office is being built to fill an entire floor at 360 Post St.
</p>
<p>
For the comments asking me to post photos of my current results, I would prefer to improve the results before posting. Hope you understand.

If you know anyone who&#39;s got a good reputation on reddit it would help if you could get them to vouch for you and your results.

Just sharing my experience in hopes that someone takes a closer eye when considering getting work by him if they fit my demographic. I don’t personally think the procedure was worth it now and based on his bedside manner and customer service 3 years post op, I would recommend another doctor.
</p>
<p>
Not interested or feel the need to validate my results for this post. The essence is how he discarded me after giving him feedback and him realizing he might not get more $ out of me.

I realise it won&#39;t help but, but it will help others. Up to you of course. I&#39;ve added this post to the wiki.

All the girls I know who went to him are in their 20s, including me. They all look pretty good and I had a drastic change. I hated my results off and on up until around 3months. Now I&#39;m starting to really like them as swelling has gone down and I&#39;ve healed. I&#39;m also planning to have a round two for what I left out last time, so I can only imagine it will look even better. When did you have surgery? Sometimes we are our worst critics

I know of a user in her 20s on here who went to him and posted pics of her results which were really good.  Perhaps you could post a pic of your experience to back up your claim?

Not a butcher. Credible guy. Just give your results time.  I will say his clientele seems to be more of the older white transitioners with cash to blow based on his articles in the media. His operating model is partially why I ended up choosing Mardirossian. That, and $55k expense was unappealing, Mardirossian was a little more than half that figure. He listened to what I wanted and we met 3+ times, went over it all and he didn’t treat me like I was a plebeian who didn’t know what was “best” for me. The whole D-B website is written in a condescending undertone of “you’re a moron so here are some tips for you from the supreme practitioners” plus Spiegel has just started to become arrogant at this point too...”you’ll be ogled” to everyone lol. I’ll hand it to him—YouTube stars were a good marketing tool!

Hey I&#39;m a week late to this but I also chose Mardirossian for similar reasons. Did you have your FFS yet? Mine&#39;s September.

I went to Deschamps last year. I&#39;m have a SE asian profile and so my nose is flatter probably similar to an african/Filipino style. I honestly think he did a fair job. The bone work seemed solid but soft tissue could be better.  In retrospect, I was unsure of what I really wanted so I left it to his discretion. He went a conservative route for a softer ethnic touch. In reality I wanted something drastic and aggressive. I think I failed to communicate this and I also think his aesthetic for my ethnicity was not well researched.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I probably should have go to Keojampa or Lee or ideally probably should have go to korea. It was an expensive mistake and maybe I can retouch in like 3-5 years after saving again. I dont necessary totally regret the decision, I just wish I was more honest with what I wanted.

I am 39 and look younger after surgery with him than before. Took several months to heal though and regrow shock-lost hair. I do have criticisms of him but this isn&#39;t one.

I agree hes still very young in his career compared to the others, but hes been working longer than 3 years. He took over the practice in 2012 I believe.

I support this message. I’m 38 and in my opinion and those around me even my mother, my forehead is worse. It still juts out and It’s bumpy and looks really deformed. I would go to any other option. Cuz now I’m broke. Looks like I went to Tijuana to have it done. May have been a better option for me. I know I know people love this guy. Well I certainly don’t for good reason.
