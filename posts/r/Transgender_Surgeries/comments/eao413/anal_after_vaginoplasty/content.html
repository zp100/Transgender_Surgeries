I&#39;ve tried both to compare and have zero desire to go back. Not because it feels any worse (perhaps slightly), but because in my experience vaginal penetration is superior in every way. If you enjoy that kind of stimulation, it&#39;s on a whole different level, especially with fingers or toys that curve.

I&#39;m self-conscious about discussing how pleased I am with the outcome because I know it&#39;s painfully far off for many, but I hope it&#39;s helpful given the quantity of misinformation and selection-bias horror stories out there. There&#39;s very little information about topics like these and it was quite a shock to discover this particular thing.
</p>
<p>
My expectations were largely to eliminate dysphoria and more spontaneity (at least with penetrative sex), but it also feels like there was some aspect of sexuality I didn&#39;t realize had been missing the entire time. It&#39;s very difficult to describe how much I value it without sounding weird. I hope those that choose zero- or minimal-depth can still experience it.

for revision, but at least this time I won&#39;t have a stupid-teenager libido from adrenal testosterone overcompensation! Everything about SRS really is a marathon from hell.

It appears to be another three months (so not quite as long), but I&#39;ve gotten contradictory information before. It also may depend on how extensive the revision is, but I&#39;m preparing for the worst.

Good to hear, thanks! I feel like I&#39;ve heard about vaginal sex being underwhelming, but maybe it just depends on the person and how receptive they are to penetration in general.

That&#39;s not the case for me, I still prefer anal over vaginal sex because it&#39;s alot more pleasurable.

Thanks for the response! It sounds like this, as with so many things related to transitioning, is very YMMV

That&#39;s good to know thanks. I&#39;ve heard mixed reviews on how good vaginal feels, so I figured worst case scenario I could stay with anal, just scared at the prospect of losing that too. Does it still stimulate your prostate too, or it&#39;s just the other sensations you still enjoy?

Had you enjoyed it prior to your SRS? Or is that how you had always felt about it?

I still enjoy anal, but it&#39;s just a &#34;once in a while&#34; thing. Too much of a production for me to want to bother most of the time. Vaginal feels much better, and there isn&#39;t any real prep involved other than foreplay and applying lube. I mean, anal still feels good, but vaginal is just a much more enjoyable experience all the way around.

Thanks, the spontaneity is definitely appealing. Does vaginal feel better because anal now feels worse, or does it feel better than anal had before your SRS?

Anal feels about the same as it did before. Vaginal just feels better overall. There&#39;s far less of the whole &#34;avoiding pain game&#34; that anal can be at times -- vaginal never really hurts, no matter what position I&#39;m in. OTOH, anal can be kind of an annoying game of figure out which position doesn&#39;t hurt at some point. Anal will always just be a much more delicate undertaking, whereas with vaginal I can be much more adventurous and it&#39;ll probably still feel really good.
