Hi, I know only about Dr. Ivo Nemec who specializes in reconstructive and plastic surgeries and is known for also providing FFS for trans people in Czechia.
</p>

I visited him at the start of my transition... But then hrt kinda did it&#39;s thing so I didn&#39;t go though the procedure.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll probably go there to get tracheal shave when I&#39;ll have the time.

Does Dr. Ivo Nemec also perform type 3 forehead recontouring and Adam&#39;s apple reduction? How about the surgery results? I couldn&#39;t find more information about him. Is it more affordable?

Not making it too dependent on closeness may be recommendable.
</p>
<p>
And there is a service called
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9ucqeo/virtual_ffs_experiences/e93gg97/" rel="nofollow">virtualFFS
</a>
and consulting them in case may be a good idea. They also know surgeons. It may be necessary to discuss with them the kind of approach though. A standard may be a moderate approach. Be aware that with a more aggressive approach results can look more mask like, and less individual.
</p>
<p>
They could make a few suggestions including a minimal one. More details are
