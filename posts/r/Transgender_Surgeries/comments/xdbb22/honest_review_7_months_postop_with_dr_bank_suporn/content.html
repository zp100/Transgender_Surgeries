<p>
I have just passed 7 months post-op with Dr Bank at the Suporn Clinic and wanted to give a comprehensive review of things so far. They ask you to rank your three preferences before surgery, mine were as follows: (1) appearance (2) depth (3) sensation. I don&#39;t think this means much unless you&#39;re working with limited tissue because I got all 3 to my satisfaction (yay!)
</p>
<p>
In a nutshell I would say this surgery
<strong>
exceeded my expectations
</strong>
, with my only concerns being some minor cosmetic improvements which are offered for free a year after your primary surgery. My cishet boyfriend is also very happy, more on that below.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s important to define your aims for this surgery. Personally I am stealth and wanted as close to a &#34;cis&#34; vagina as possible and that influenced my decision. This is totally personal to you though!
</p>
<p>
I won&#39;t publicly post pics but am open to private messages if you are curious. Anyhow..
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Results
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Depth: 7-7.25 inches.
</strong>
I was originally told I got 6 inches after my surgery, but was able to increase this through religious dilation and applying some extra pressure (when given permission to). I gained the extra depth mostly within the first 2 months, while the vagina was still &#34;taking shape&#34; ie. not fully healed yet. It is important to ask clinic staff about this before attempting - I only did this because my boyfriend is bigger than 6 inches and I wanted to accommodate that. Fwiw I am 5 ft 6 tall.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Appearance:
</strong>
Looks good, my bf says it looks attractive. There is minimal scarring in my case (due to my skin tone) and I was able to start using scar gel at 1 month post op which helped (asked for approval from clinic). I have: defined inner labia which are rather wrinkly/natural looking and full length, slim labia majora, a small clit with clitoral hood and pink tissue between my labia minora (as in natal women - only possible if uncircumcised). When I am standing up it looks very cute and petite, but when I spread my legs lying down it has a tendency to &#34;gape&#34; slightly at the entrance to the canal.
<ul>
<li>
I would like to get a free cosmetic revision next year to &#34;close up&#34; the bottom of the vulva and fix the gaping by connecting the two labia, which cannot be done in the primary surgery due to dilation requirements. There is also some hair at the entrance to the vagina (not inside) which the clinic can use electrolysis for. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a
<strong>
7/10 currently looks-wise
</strong>
and I would be satisfied
<strong>
without
</strong>
a revision, but it&#39;s free so why not go ahead and make it a 9-10 right?
</li>
<li>
It&#39;s worth mentioning I had some
<strong>
clitoral necrosis
</strong>
on the surface of my clit, which needed to be removed. Luckily the clinic makes the clit bigger in the first place so there is tissue to lose, and also places remaining sensate tissue beneath the clit to preserve sensation. So while I have a smaller, more &#34;hidden&#34; clit the sensation is 100% there and can orgasm (more below).
</li>
<li>
<em>
This is my personal opinion, but
</em>
<strong>
<em>
Suporn Clinic
</em>
</strong>
<em>
and
</em>
<strong>
<em>
Chettawut
</em>
</strong>
<em>
are the only two surgeons I&#39;ve seen who are to be able to create
</em>
<strong>
<em>
full length labia minora
</em>
</strong>
<em>
that completely surround the vaginal entrance like in natal women. In other surgeons I often see the vaginal opening positioned
</em>
<strong>
<em>
below
</em>
</strong>
*, rather than*
<strong>
<em>
between
</em>
</strong>
*, the labia, which is a major aesthetic consideration for me.*
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Sensation:
</strong>
I was able to achieve
<strong>
orgasm
</strong>
by masturbating (rubbing the area around the clit) at about
<strong>
3.5 months post op
</strong>
. I can now do this regularly and without fail, feels great. I prefer not to touch the clit directly as it&#39;s a bit too sensitive for my liking, but stimulating the skin surrounding it gets me there! I have had a few orgasms from penetration too which feels entirely different to external stimulation (prostate maybe?) so it&#39;s good having 2 options here! In both cases I need to concentrate fairly hard and have consistent stimulation in a certain way to get there.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Function:
</strong>
I had
<strong>
PIV sex at about 2.5 months post-op
</strong>
. I dilated beforehand and used lots of lube and it surprisingly felt good the first time with no blood, although a little tight and we needed to go slowly. I have had regular PIV sex since then and over time it has become more &#34;stretchy,&#34; allowing for more positions like me on top, standing up, missionary, doggy. At the start I always dilated before sex, but now I don&#39;t need to.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Lubrication:
</strong>
I always use lube for dilation and used lube for sex for the first
<strong>
5 months
</strong>
. I am able to get decently wet after I&#39;m aroused, although I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s less than a natal female would. Recently I have been having sex using saliva only or when I&#39;m aroused and it&#39;s worked fine - it feels better for both me and my partner without lube so I&#39;ve ditched it for sex. Inside the vagina it is not dry, it is consistently &#34;moist&#34; but again probably not as much as a natal female.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Discharge:
</strong>
For the first
<strong>
3 months
</strong>
I had consistent yellow discharge necessitating fairly heavy duty pads. From about
<strong>
month 4 onwards
</strong>
this became less and less, and I switched to and still wear a light panty liner which I change once per day. I tend to have a small amount of colourless, odour-free discharge to this day hence the liners. I presume this will continue to decrease until I no longer need the liners.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Cleaning:
</strong>
I douched after every dilation/sex for the first
<strong>
2-3 months
</strong>
, then gradually did it less and less (only douched when I had a bad smell or heavy discharge). From about
<strong>
month 5 onwards
</strong>
I stopped douching entirely and I simply use a ph-balanced vaginal wash around the entrance when I shower. No odours and my boyfriend says I taste &#34;very good&#34; which was surprising to me! Note: it smelt pretty bad during the first month of recovery but that cleared up quickly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
Recovery
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Month 1 (0 months post op):
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
While in Thailand, recovery wasn&#39;t too bad. The most pain I had was probably a 6/10 on the day immediately after surgery (managed with painkillers in hospital) and during my first ever dilation where I bled a little bit.
</li>
<li>
Dilation got easier very quickly though and was consistently 5-10 minutes TTD. While in Thailand I did 2x static dilations per day for the first week, and then 3x dynamic dilations. Never had any problems with the M or L sizes, did not use the S.
</li>
<li>
In this time I went from 6 inches to just under 7 inches.
</li>
<li>
I travelled to Thailand alone and was able to manage by myself - the clinic staff were very attentive and visit you every day + biweekly clinic checkups.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Months 2-3 (1-2 months post op):
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Returned to my home country and this is where things got a little more difficult. Due to the body wanting to contract scar tissue rapidly beginning in the 2nd month post-surgery, dilation became increasingly more uncomfortable and TTD increased to up to 30 minutes, and 45 minutes at its worst around the start of the 3rd month.
</li>
<li>
I religiously did 3x daily dilations during this time (luckily I did not need to go up to 4x as some do), but I did need to start using the S size to begin my sessions, as leaving a 8-10 hour gap would rapidly make things tight. Doing the S, M and then L with a long TTD plus clean-up made sessions take up to 2.5 hours (and I had to do it 3 times daily).
</li>
<li>
This was very emotionally taxing and depressing, and arguably the worst part of the recovery by far, but I kept up the schedule nonetheless.
</li>
<li>
During this time I would aim for between 6.5 and 7 inches and all of my normal mobility (non-strenuous) returned.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Months 4-5 (3-4 months post op):
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
By about 3 months post-op, the aforementioned scar contraction started to slow down and I was able to drop down to 2x dilations per day about 2 weeks ahead of schedule (yay!). This immediately made things a lot more bearable and by this point I was very mobile (eg. jogging) and even able to travel internationally. Around this point I also stopped using the S dilator and was able to start with the M consistently. TTD returned to about 20 minutes.
</li>
<li>
By now I was consistently hitting at least 7 inches depth.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Month 6 onward (5 months post op):
</strong>
<ul>
<li>
At about 5ish months (a few weeks ahead of schedule - yay again!) I dropped down to 1x dilation per day. TTD is now under 10 minutes and I can leave up to 35 hours between dilations before it starts to get difficult, so I&#39;m just doing 1 per day at any time I please. I aim to stop using the M size dilator soon and just starting with the L, which will further cut down my dilation time which is about 50 minutes start to finish per day currently.
</li>
<li>
I am still consistently hitting at least 7 inches depth, but sometimes 7.25 depending on the day.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Any questions ask in the comments! Very happy and +recommendation for anyone considering SRS.

I saw some of dr sutin work and some of them have long labia that goes around the vaginal entrance, also dr theerapong does the same thing.

Thanks a million for this report, he is on the top of my list now so it&#39;s appreciated. It has always been between him and Dr.Sutin.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me did you get epidural or GA?

I&#39;m not op obviously, but I also had surgery with Dr Banks, I&#39;m 5 months post now, and generally concur with op. Really happy with everything. I did get an epidural seemed to do the trick. 🤷‍♀️

Do you mind me asking how did that go? In comparison to GA? I never had epidural, kinda scares me to be able to wake up mid surgery.☺ Also how long is the surgery, doesn&#39;t epidural last only couple of hours?

I asked the anaesthetist about that and she practically slapped me! 🤣 she&#39;s been working with suporn clinic since inception and has never had an issue. Surgery is 6 hours, I definitely didn&#39;t wake up early, and having had GA before, I would say I felt less completely shit afterwards.

Exactly, the anaesthetist kicks you OFF, then slowly lift you UP, as everything is done. No chance.

How was the process for getting a surgery date for you? I&#39;ve heard it can be a bit of a pain for Bank.

600,000 baht. I believe it is 650,000 baht now because I paid in 2020 (original date was cancelled due to COVID). Bank transfer only

hey. 2 weeks post-op here, also with bank. i have a question though that maybe you could help me answering? i have tried looking elsewhere on reddit and can’t seem to find the exact info i’m looking for
</p>
<p>
so there’s this common saying “no sexy thoughts” after surgery for like 2 months or whatever. but i’ve recently entered a new relationship, had sex for the first time with that person just before i left to get the surgery, and now my estrogen levels are also kinda low since i’m slowly tapering back up until i reach the same dosage as pre-op.
</p>
<p>
basically i get really horny really easily a lot of the time, just can’t fucking help it unfortunately. i’m not touching myself or anything, but i can definitely feel that i’m aroused down there. frustrating as it is to not touch myself, i can manage that quite easily, but what frustrates me more is this whole “i shouldn’t be having these thoughts at all” part. is there any real reason for this? like is getting aroused gonna affect the stitches, what’s it gonna do? no one seems to give an exact reason for not having ANY horny thoughts at all post-op. and at least knowing why it’s bad would help me remind myself why i don’t need to do it, but otherwise i just keep getting hella frustrated and bad about myself. kinda makes me feel like i’m not taking care well enough of my recovery.
</p>
<p>
so “no sexy thoughts”. but why? did you happen to find out from anyone?

<p>
The &#34;sexy thoughts&#34; cause increased blood flow to the genital area which is bad after surgery since it can lead to excess swelling, rupturing of stitches and wound separation along the incisions, which risks longer term scarring. Don&#39;t forget that some erectile tissue is left there with Dr Bank, the expansion of which can disrupt the surrounding healing tissue.
</p>
<p>
I also have a bf and had trouble avoiding those thoughts. My best advice is to wear a thick pad with underwear on the tighter side, that way the constant pressure of the pad+underwear will compress the healing area and avoid any expansion. I had a few sexual dreams and accidentally fantasised quite a bit during the first couple of months but nothing bad happened to me. Just keep it compressed in the underwear and don&#39;t get carried away with those thoughts.

I’ve heard of people early post op injuring themselves and bleeding with sexy thoughts. The times for anything later on will vary with the individual and is more a a matter of risk.

I&#39;d assume not, but the base of the clit is positioned quite deep and can definitely feel it during sex.

you mean, like during penetration you can feel it &#34;in&#34; the clitoris - and can also add external pressure to feel it from the outside?

Wow that&#39;s sound nice!
</p>
<p>
How is the elasricity/flexibility? I read here and there that the tunnel of the vagina after SRS is rather inflexible, and thus specific positions are hard and just don&#39;t work. Because it&#39;s not muscle and the internals are not really moving/rearranging. Is that something you can already comment on?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your answers, can&#39;t wait to here more of your journey and progress within the next months.

It definitely lacks elasticity to the degree of a cis vagina and won&#39;t just open/close on demand, but dilation makes sure the tissue stays &#34;soft&#34; and somewhat malleable. The main issue is the entrance where they stitched together the graft and your external skin - this needs to be dilated initially to keep it soft or it forms a harder &#34;scar ring&#34;
</p>
<p>
I personally haven&#39;t had too much difficulty with any kind of position so far, but I will say if I have not dilated in a while things are a little slower to start up.  The inside of the vagina has some stretch to it.

I feel the penetration more without it, since the lube acts kind of like a &#34;barrier&#34; I guess. Also the lube is messy and without it we&#39;re able to switch between oral and sex more easily

But salivia gets absorbed very fast which is not enough for sex maybe?

I&#39;ve found I only really need the lube to get started, once we&#39;re going it&#39;s fine

Did you have hair removal prior to surgery? Do you have any hair around the opening or in the canal that survived the follicular scrape?

No hair removal before surgery. There is no hair inside the vagina as they completely scrape it. However there is some near the opening on the perineum area that I want to get removed during revision.
