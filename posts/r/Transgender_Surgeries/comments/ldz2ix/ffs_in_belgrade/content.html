2 pass  slaughter house and other cheaper clinics lower their price to attract patients for cookie cutter surgery which in the end is more expensive due to botched surgery results that will need fixing or mediocre results with functional issues. If you&#39;re in Europe you SHOULD only go to FT or Inglefield in London if you want an uneventful recovery and good results.

I have had experience with Dr Stajcic and would not recommend him. When I asked for a portfolio of before and after photos, he said he “didn’t have time” to get one together. He told me a number of falsehoods, including that “you can eat absolutely anything after sliding genioplasty the very next day, because it has no effect on the bite”. Read anybody’s recovery journal. You’re on a liquid diet and then soft foods for at least a week after a genioplasty.
</p>
<p>
When I asked him how many millimeters he would move my chin, he couldn’t answer and said, “You will have to trust my judgement.” I felt weird about this but said okay, he’s an experienced surgeon, I guess I’ll trust him.
</p>
<p>
He did no planning of the movement, he had no x-rays done of my chin to determine the best plan of action. When I read about other’s experiences, I see that reputable surgeons like Dr Eppley and Dr Hammond have x-rays done to plan the exact movement well before surgery.
</p>
<p>
He didn’t seem to have a good handle on how surgery works, asking me to get all kinds of tests done in my home country as well as a letter that stated I could go under general anesthesia. The doctors in my home country were very confused by this request and told me the doctor conducting the surgery should have set up an appointment with
<em>
his
</em>
anesthesiologist to approve me for anesthesia. When I related this to Dr Stajcic, he replied, “Okay, yes that’s how it’s done.” Shady.
</p>
<p>
Then he failed to confirm my appointment despite my clear indication that I would like to book. Instead he confirmed at the last minute, asked me to transfer €300, and said we could meet the day before surgery. My bank wouldn’t allow me to transfer internationally, so I explained this to Dr Stajcic in person. He said okay, don’t stress, just pay the next day upon discharge. We said okay. I sent him a text message later saying that I found a way to transfer the money via a service called TransferWise, or just “Wise”, but it would arrive a couple days later, would that also be okay? He said no. So I spent hours with my mother to get our bank to transfer the money to my husband’s credit card. When it finally worked, and I texted Dr Stajcic, he told me he was canceling the surgery because I didn’t transfer the €300 in time. Literally 9 hours before the surgery, after my husband and I took off work to come to Serbia, spent money on accommodation, scrambled around to get all these expensive tests done that he asked for, after he said we could pay the next day, Dr Stajcic simply canceled the surgery. He sent me a very rude and humiliating message when I protested.
</p>
<p>
I feel really humiliated, hurt, and homesick right now in my room in Belgrade. It’s been very confusing and stressful and I’m still processing. But in answer to your question, save your money, vet your surgeon thoroughly, and don’t be afraid to take a lot of time. You have your whole life ahead of you to look beautiful.

Facialteam gets natural results and very positive reviews, is it that much cheaper in Belgrade? By how much?

Well I saw so many people few weeks ago had negative reviews with the one that runs 2pass clinic. Its very risky and you can&#39;t always be 100% sure if everything will go right. However facialteam is the one worth trust rn

yes exactly, so you can be sure about facialteam. If you can afford facialteam then there is no reason to not go for it
