Its far too early to pass judgement.  Faces heal over months.  As always in these things, give it some time to settle down.

If its anything like me, yes they will. Once the brows relax and lowers, any tilt I had went away. It takes a while though. The tilt and height of on mine went away almost completely, which in my case I was kinda disappointed. swelling is very very deceiving

There is less tilt to them as swelling on my face has gone down. For reference, I am a white girl.
</p>
<p>
After watching my ex go through the process of healing from FFS, please remember how radically different your face looks with swelling vs once it has gone down.

This is 1 day post op. You had your brow lifted that is probably pulling on your skin.  In addition your face is incredibly swollen. Like everyone else I recognize deschamps-braly&#39;s casts lol so when you see him for your second post op if you still have feelings about it then you can talk to him about it?
</p>
<p>
I would for now absolutely not fret about your results for at least a few weeks if even then. You will look
<em>
very
</em>
different in even 4 weeks.

You should be able to email zhanna about it if it&#39;s bothering you. I emailed her - a lot - during my recovery.

Aww thank you! Looking at your face even 1 day post op I can see a lot of what he did under it and it looks good imo. You had a really great starting point too!
</p>
<p>
Believe me I freaked out plenty during my recovery so I get it so I totally understand where you&#39;re coming from.

Did you have type 3? I think type 3 is too aggresive for most Asian girls. Your eyes preop look feminine already, same with the nose? I&#39;d say you didn&#39;t need ffs or maybe just a bit of chin burring and that&#39;s it.

It may just be swelling. Give it 3 weeks before asking Dr. DB. I think swelling in that area goes quite quickly.

He does have a good record so far and his main training is in FFS. I don&#39;t know either why your eyes are now slanted as usually the eyebrows would end up looking higher and the eyes more wide. You don&#39;t even look bruised at all and the ones I&#39;ve seen before from other doctors look like they were hit by a bus. I&#39;d try to stay positive as it is very early. By week 3-4 how your eyes, eyebrows and forehead look is a good determiner of how the final results will look like. You can also ask him your concerns in the post op consult. My bet is that this is swelling distorting your eye shape.

Botched? Girl I got botched and know what botched is really like. If he botched you you&#39;d be blind by now. You&#39;ll have difficulty even moving your eyeballs and you&#39;ll have bulges and dents in your forehead plus all your nerves severed beyond salvation. I got truly botched by a mass murderer Dr. Butcher Bart Van de Ven and I have no nerves or nerve canals left cause he sawed them off and put them in a bin. My chin and neck super tight, I have permanent discoloration from his botched lipo, my chin dimples and has dents when I speak and smile, I bite my lip when I eat and teeth hurt when I chew cause he put screws too close to my teeth roots. It doesn&#39;t end there. My jaw and chin now look like an arrow head. My jaw all gone and I look like I need jaw surgery. My speech was impaired for 2 months too and of course 8 months passed and I&#39;m still 100% numb. This is what botched is like. My butcher destroyed me and left me damaged. I wil need to have another surgery to remove my screws. Having said that give it a watchful eye but try not think of the worse yet. Your surgeon is 10 times better than the one that murdered me. Keep calm.

Oh I&#39;m not very strong and to be honest I feel suicidal everyday. I lost so much to this butchery and I literally paid to be messed with by a butcher without my prior knowledge of Butcher Van de Ven&#39;s crimes and utter incompetence. If I could I would skin him alive. He exactly sawed off my jaw without a care and what&#39;s insulting for me is he got paid for it. But I&#39;m raising awareness about his incompetence to make others aware how careless and unsuitable he is to perform ffs.

Your eyes will look different after type 3 forehead reconstruction, since your forehead has been altered, and the way your eyes are framed will look different.
</p>
<p>
Did you just have FFS with Dr. D? That cast looks familiar.
