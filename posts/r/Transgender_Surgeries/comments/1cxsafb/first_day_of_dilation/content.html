Yup I&#39;ve been feeling it this morning though! I generally heal very well which is a lucky break because that&#39;s just about all my body has been doing the last couple years. Six surgeries since April 2022. Looking back I&#39;m not sure how I made it LOL. Definitely was a running the gauntlet type situation. I have to give credit to Stiller and his surgery team they really do know what they&#39;re doing at this point and I think a lot of the good healing has just been following their instructions, and doing A LOT of wound care.

She looks very good!  WOW such fast healing!!  Good for you.  So many girls would find this quick wound healing enviable! Did you get all of your surgeries with the same doctor?  Were all of your surgeries gender affirming?  What technique did Dr. Stiller use?  Again, congrats! xo

So this is round two of bottom surgery. I am about 7 months post of from the zero depth surgery which is why it mostly looks amazing. I do have wound separation and other assorted shenanigans going on kinda below my inner labia. If I spread my pussy open you can see all the ouchie areas. It&#39;s actually not too bad, I am walking with a cane and it IS painfull. This is something that passes, I do quite a bit of wound care and I&#39;m religiously dilating 3x daily for 30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had six surgeris since 2022: top surgery Dr. Mangubat at La Belle Vie in Tukwila WA, bilateral orchiechtomy by Dr. Avery at Kaiser urology in Seattle, Two rounds of FFS with Tommy Liu in Seattle, Two stages of bottom surgery with Stiller in Spokane. And yeah all my surgeries have been gender affirming. You can find more information about Dr. Stiller on their website Stilleraesthetics.com

So I started the referral process in July 2021. Appointment for consultation was booked in January 2022 for August 2022. First surgery was December 2023, second surgery was just a few days ago 5/14/24. So almost 3 years from the beginning of the referral process. It actually took a few months to get all my letters and everything done before that. So a little over 3 years including gathering letters of support from various healthcare providers. My understanding is that it&#39;s currently a two year wait to surgery. Which tracks because that&#39;s about how long it took me to get my zero depth done
</p>
<p>
Stiller is awesome, sometimes a little stingy on the pain meds but a lot of doctors are these days, especially when it comes to women&#39;s pain after surgery or a birth or something. You&#39;ll need to get your hotel situation and your caregiver figured out way in advance. You have to be in town for at least two weeks so they can check in on you so you&#39;re on the hook for a two week hotel bill. I got my unemployed friend to come along with me twice, hopefully you can find a family member or a friend who wouldn&#39;t mind helping out. You can do most care tasks by yourself in recovery but will be pretty out of it, so you need someone to drive you around and help you with various tasks you won&#39;t be allowed (or really able) to do.
</p>
<p>
Hoping this was valuable information!
