In my experience, most people will be allowed to start hormones again very quickly after they leave their week in the hospital. It will still be like 2.5 weeks in total without hormones though at least

I was told over email that stopping hormones isn&#39;t a strict requirement. Heres what i was told
</p>
<p>
&#34;Stopping the hormone 2 weeks before the surgery is what we highly recommended. However, we do know that not all comply to this. It is our responsibility to inform you the risks in advance, but there is no way we can completely force you to stop. If client still decides to take the hormone and have some complications arising from this, at least, she acknowledged it in advance. &#34;

If clients still decide to take the hormone leading up to the surgery, it is their choice, they only need to acknowledge and accept the risks in advance. &#34;

There&#39;s not incredibly strict, however you should disclose everything to them, they will manage.
</p>
<p>
I still had an estrogen pellet implanted when I had surgery. They&#39;re mostly worried about dvt for estrogen. So if you&#39;re otherwise low risk, it&#39;s unlikely to be an issue. But definitely talk to them.
