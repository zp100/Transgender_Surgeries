I&#39;d like to take a moment to discuss how this sub is moderated and the philosophy behind it. I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for a while, but life gets in the way.
</p>
<p>
A reddit community is hugely influenced by its moderation, and poorly done it will drive people away and competing subs will pop up. Reddit&#39;s very darwinian that way, survival of the fittest. You can see more about these philosophical issues behind reddit on
<a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit">r/TheoryOfReddit</a>
.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s currently
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/about/rules/">9 rules on this sub</a>
, and they have been added to and refined since
<a href="/u/SleepNowMyThrowaway">u/SleepNowMyThrowaway</a>
created the sub 5 years ago. I joined the sub as moderator 3 years ago, and SleepNowMyThrowaway left reddit sometime in 2022.
</p>
<p>
My personal aim here is to build a community that helps the trans people with surgery in all its forms, and the rules are written with that aim in mind. I&#39;m not personally all that interested in surgery anymore as I know all I could possibly want to for myself. I am interested in helping the trans community though, and I can do that here. I also do it in a couple of other ways
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I&#39;ve built a wiki of all
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/australia/content.md">HRT prescribing doctors in Australia</a>
, and this is of personally interest to me as I have been affected by poor levels of care here. I&#39;m not prepared to put up with any more of it. I&#39;ve also collected also  lots of info on
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/implants/content.md">pellet implants</a>
, etc.
</li>
<li>
I moderate
<a href="/r/DrWillPowers">r/DrWillPowers</a>
, mainly behind the scenes fixing up the wiki and other stuff that&#39;s not overly visible. I don&#39;t post there much.
</li>
<li>
The
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/wiki/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/index/content.md">surgery wiki</a>
is technically two different subs, but I&#39;ve set it up to look its part of this sub. It&#39;s not really anything to do with being a moderator or moderation, but does help build this community.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, if we look at the (abbreviated) rules
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
Be respectful
</strong>
This helps build community and attracts more informed conversation. Being rude or offensive does not. And personally I do not like people being rude to others and have little tolerance for it, however I do understand that not everyone has a good command of English and some of us have issues that cause difficulty.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Posts with NSFW content must be marked nsfw.
</strong>
This sub contains a lot of NSFW content, but is not itself marked as NSFW to make it more discoverable. We can&#39;t help the people who cannot find the sub.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Report chasers, trolls and hate speech. Do not engage, let the mods take care of it.
</strong>
When you report something its directly flagged to the moderators for review (the mod queue). It’s the first thing we look at. Imagine if we had to go and read every comment and check who posted it and why. I do check every report, and I also issue many bans from the sub. Not every flagged report results in an action as I don&#39;t agree with all of them, but they will all be reviewed and far more quickly than me reading posts. Also, mods on reddit do not know who made the reports so you don&#39;t have to worry about that. The site admins do however and abusing the report button can result in action from them. Making the occasional mistake definitely won&#39;t reach that threshold. Personally I always report hate to the site admins
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/report">here</a>
, and you can too, usually under
<em>
&#34;It&#39;s promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability&#34;
</em>
. With any luck you&#39;ll get a message from the admins and they will be banned from the entire site. For further reading on hate look at
<a href="/r/AgainstHateSubreddits">r/AgainstHateSubreddits</a>
. You can see how entire subs get banned.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Keep posts on topic.
</strong>
Keeping the sub on topic is important to building the community. On reddit you subscribe to the subs you&#39;re interested in and if you want to see memes for example you subscribe to an appropriate sub. Off topic posts drive people away. There&#39;s some question over what exactly is on topic, as some prefer a dry more academic discussion of surgery while others want emotional support. At the moment its inclusive of all aspects of surgery, and I don&#39;t think the sub is big enough to make it in the community’s interest to split it out.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
This sub is by and for trans people.
</strong>
this was
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/g7ah4u/clarification_of_rule_5_this_sub_is_by_and_for/content.html">discussed previously</a>
. This rule is fairly strictly enforced and there&#39;s not many cis people here. Since then I have also found it makes the sub a lot easier to moderate.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Posts by people with a commercial interest in members decisions.
</strong>
. Also
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/exrxnh/rule_6_posts_from_those_with_a_commercial/content.html">discussed previously</a>
, and I think this rule has worked out very well. I have observed more interest in it by people will commercial interests, and I don&#39;t think it helps any of us for it to turn into a sales and marketing platform. Surgeons have enough of those, and we need a space of our own to counter that influence.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
English only.
</strong>
This rule is unfortunate, but I review
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/">every post and comment</a>
here and running every non-English comment though google translate takes too much of my time. I believe this level of review is beneficial to the community and I can&#39;t afford to do it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
No posts who&#39;s primary purpose is to discuss other people (face, surgery, etc).
</strong>
Consider how you would feel if someone made a post about you, especially if it was critical in some form. We&#39;re all members of the same community, and humanity for that matter, so lets not do that.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
No sexually suggestive compliments or comments that may be interpreted that way.
</strong>
When you see these comments it’s unclear how to take them, and there&#39;s enough cis guys treating this a porn sub already (report them so they can be banned). Even if it’s meant in a nice way, leave it. It causes concern, wastes my time checking your post history, and doesn&#39;t help the community as a whole.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Notice there&#39;s no rule about misinformation. So what do you do when you see it? What if someone&#39;s posted something wrong and/or harmful? Generally, I believe it’s best to be discussed by members of the community and not the mods. The mods are not experts on everything posted here (or any of it really). Our role is to build the community, we&#39;re not doctors. I don&#39;t want to make a statement or remove a post and cause harm by incorrectly doing so. And if the information really is incorrect then a community discussion about why its incorrect helps everyone - if we removed it then the misinformation won&#39;t go away, it will just remain uncorrected and cause more harm. The other issue is one of time, I don&#39;t have much available, and I&#39;d prefer if I didn&#39;t have to spend time checking all this stuff when others can do it. It’s not like I can do better than many others who post here (and there are actual doctors and surgeons who comment here sometimes).
</p>
<p>
A very recent example is this post
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/povqwd/importantvital_srs_information_about_avoiding/content.html">Important/vital SRS information about avoiding diversion neovaginitis post-colovaginoplasty</a>
. I don&#39;t know if its misinformation or not, I&#39;ve not even read it and don&#39;t particularly want to, but I see a robust discussion (argument) and people reading it can make up their own minds. If people are polite about arguing their points then I see this as the best way to handle these issues. It people are rude then it doesn&#39;t matter if they are correct or not, mod action will be taken under rule 1.
</p>
<p>
In another form this misinformation comes up in surgeon reviews. Some posts appear to be advertising for surgeons, but I don&#39;t remove them. There&#39;s a wide gray area and its hard to be sure. Usually people will speak up when they see these and question them, which also helps others who may not be as aware of these things in the future. But please be polite about it. I think I&#39;ve only
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/m21xc1/this_is_why_we_have_a_rule_against_commercial/content.html">taken action once</a>
for this, when it got particularly bad and no one else said anything.
</p>
<p>
And yet another form is the negative surgeon review. Occasionally they are not very credible, but again are not removed. It&#39;s not possible to know if they are true or not, and if they were to be removed its potentially very harmful to people who go to these surgeons. Even it it were known that the review was false it’s still better to keep it up and show that its false, for the reasons outlined before. There&#39;s also a serious imbalance of power between ourselves and doctors/surgeons and it’s not in our interests to censor members of the community.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s rare, but occasionally someone will post something that&#39;s not ok and yet doesn&#39;t violate any rule. Personally, I&#39;m guided by the philosophy I&#39;ve outlined - what best helps this community? Mods can take action regardless of the rules, and do, but if it happens often enough a new rule will get added.
</p>
<p>
What happens if you&#39;re banned and its &#34;unfair&#34;. You can ask for it to be undone, and perhaps after review it will be, but at the end of the day there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. It&#39;s how reddit works. The same applies to moderators of reddit subs. The person on top of the moderator list,
<del>
<a href="/u/SleepNowMyThrowaway">u/SleepNowMyThrowaway</a>
</del>
<a href="/u/HiddenStill">u/HiddenStill</a>
in this case, has ultimate power and can dismiss or ban any moderator below them, and there&#39;s nothing they can do about it either. The only ones above this are the site admins (employees of reddit) and they never take action unless the site rules are broken, and often not even then.
</p>
<p>
I believe that as this sub continues to grow it will have more influence in the world of trans surgery. I&#39;ve observed it in the increasing number of people working in trans medical care asking if they can post surveys or promote presentations, etc. In general, the answer is no, they can&#39;t, as I&#39;m concerned it will shift the community in the &#34;wrong&#34; direction (i.e. rule 5, the sub is by and for trans people). There&#39;s also recently been a few journalists and they have been allowed to post.
</p>
<p>
A few months ago there were a number of posts about people being critical of surgical results. Eg. this one
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/nnnzwt/my_preop_ladies_be_kind_and_less_judgy/content.html">My pre-op ladies, be kind and less judgy...</a>
by
<a href="/u/LaurenRossy1">u/LaurenRossy1</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&#39;ve been meaning to address it, but its tricky and I haven&#39;t had the time. As I mentioned in that post
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’m going to make a post and an update to the rules soon. I’m struggling a bit to come up with something that will help without damaging the utility of the sub.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hopefully some of what I&#39;ve written above explains why I find this issue difficult. I&#39;ll get to it eventually. I hope.
</p>
<p>
As this sub grows in influence I believe it will help improve our standard of medical care. Sub-standard medical care and surgeons will increasingly be exposed and will either lose business or get better at what they do. Either way is good.
</p>

Re: Rule 6: What are some of the other platforms that surgeons use to advertise?
</p>
<p>
I definitely agree with the rule 100%, but as I&#39;m looking into surgery myself, it might be nice to have that investigation point available.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m assuming the surgeons&#39; websites are one, but are there others that are commonly known?

Facebook groups are a pretty big one in my opinion. Often times they don’t even have to directly disclose that they’re working with the surgeon they’re promoting. It’s getting a little better but if you’re asking for information about a specific surgeon and someone say something along the lines of “Oh go to this surgeon instead” I’d take that recommendation with a heavy grain of salt.

Definitely Facebook. There&#39;s some really questionably activity there, and the trans surgery groups encourage surgeons to post. There&#39;s also more direct marketing as surgeons often have their own pages. Virtually no one does that on reddit.
</p>
<p>
Realself is another.
</p>
<p>
Then there&#39;s this network is sites (and probably more) - take a look at who the &#34;featured&#34; surgeons are.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.mtfsurgery.net">https://www.mtfsurgery.net</a>

My biggest issue with pushing the wiki is that it was really unintuitive to navigate. When looking for specific information I knew was on the wiki, I couldn&#39;t find it after looking for a long while.

I think you guys are doing a good job. You’re kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place. In my opinion, the very nature of trans surgery makes any space where it’s discussed openly susceptible to misinformation and nastiness.
</p>
<p>
The hearsay and anecdotes from people who haven’t had surgery or quite frankly have had limited experience post-surgery sometimes just gets taken as gospel without any questioning. I’ve seen people’s actual tangible experiences get shot down by people who are just repeating something they read on susans ten years ago.
</p>
<p>
Combatting misinformation is hard, most of us aren’t taught much about it and the little we are taught often doesn’t stick. I mean just look at what’s been going on with this pandemic. I think by encouraging transparency (especially among those here with commercial interests) and keeping this space for those of us who will always be the closest to this issue you’re doing the best you can.

I appreciate this post, and i do think you are doing a decent job of things. I have two questions/concerns about accountability for certain moderation.
</p>
<p>
I posted
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/mtjrc9/im_scheduled_to_have_bottom_surgery_in_a_little/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share" rel="nofollow">this</a>
a few months back, which I was not able to find in breaking of any rules. The post was locked without explanation or comment, and I had to contact you to get either an explanation or to have it unlocked. Thankfully, the post was unlocked and sorted quickly, but there was no known explanation.
</p>
<p>
This does raise a couple concerns however:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
When a post is locked or a user is banned in error, whether it was a genuine mistake or something more deliberate, is there anything that can be done to hold the individuals who make these mistakes accountable? At this point the post in question was months ago and I have moved on from that stage in my life so getting an explanation is not really relevant anymore, but the question remains.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A moderator also on that post left a comment containing covid misinformation when the post itself barely mentioned covid. It&#39;s one thing for users on the sub to post misinformation or potential misinformation as that can be discussed and corrected by other members of the sub, but what if it comes from an admin? Is there any accountability there?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
For the most part I feel like this space is generally good for trans people to discuss and get information on surgeons and procedures, it&#39;s just this sort of thing rubbed me the wrong way.

You should probably take a look at
<a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit" rel="nofollow">r/TheoryOfReddit</a>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I don&#39;t recall the post and unfortunately the moderation log only goes back 3 months so I can&#39;t find out what happened. No everything that goes wrong here has a person doing it - there&#39;s some automated moderation on this sub.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not really. Like the bans, you can go and complain elsewhere or start your own sub, but its probably not very productive.
</p>
<p>
Depending on what it is, it could in principal cause an argument between the mods, but remember the higher mods can always ban lower mods. Moderating is something of a hassle so perhaps the higher mod might give it up rather than try to find a new mod(s).
</p>
<p>
I have seen people occasional complain about my mod actions on other subs, and I really don&#39;t care. I&#39;ve seen so much truly offensive stuff on reddit that I barely notice something like that. I also ban somewhere between 10 and 40 people a week. Sometimes its a mistake and I unban then when they contact me, other times they are extremely offensive, and all the variations in between. Perhaps some are still mistakes, but I try my best.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
but what if it comes from an admin?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As above.
</p>
<p>
To address what you&#39;re getting at, when you get right down to it reddit is not a democracy. I&#39;m not the top mod on this sub and the top mod can always override my decisions, but if there was too much of that I&#39;d quit. And when I say too much, I mean very little as what I do here is quite onerous and I&#39;m fairly burned out on it all. There&#39;s nothing I can do about it and I&#39;d not bother trying. If a higher mod is unhappy with me then that&#39;s even easier. I have on rare occasions raised issues with moderation, and generally been satisfied with the response. I think it helps to consider that no one is perfect and we&#39;re never going to agree on everything, but its better than the alternative. If its not then do what you have to.

I just had a look at the post you mention, and it does make me wonder whether your first point is a consequence of your second point. Of course, it could have been a genuine mistake, but if not, then it is quite concerning. But as HiddenStill says, reddit isn&#39;t a democracy, unfortunately.
