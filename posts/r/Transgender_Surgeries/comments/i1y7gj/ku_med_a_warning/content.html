Dr. Meredith Gray on the KU Med transgender surgical team does not truly care about the patient. She has not done a single thing to help me with my complications that have been ongoing since surgery.
</p>
<p>
When I was in-patient I had a surgical hematoma that resulted in a fever of 103 for 2 days, she told me everything was perfect and normal.
</p>
<p>
Now, 9 months later, I still bleed from the inner depths of my neo vagina. I cannot have sex because the angle and opening are too misshapen.  I have brought this all up to her multiple times and she does not care that I am extremely uncomfortable, only citing that it looks like the rest of her patients &#34;cis ones too&#34; and everything is perfect.
</p>
<p>
I saw Dr. Dugi at OHSU in Portland 6 months post-op because Dr. Grays team would not acknowledge that I need a revision and Dr. Dugi immediately was able to offer 6 different things that he could do in one surgical appointment to make me more comfortable, able to have sex and stop the bleeding.
</p>
<p>
This is simply just a warning, Meredith Gray at KU Med is not looking out for us.

Isn’t Meredith Gray the main character on Gray’s Anatomy?
</p>
<p>
Whether or not she is, I’m so so sorry you’ve had this experience. :(

My first thought too, she must get that all the time. Sucks that she sounds like the antithesis of Meredith on the show. Gray&#39;s anatomy Meredith would be a 200% increase in quality

Damn... my friend recently has surgery there and now I&#39;m really worried about her. I hope you&#39;re able to get the revisions you need.

Meredith grey finally said I would need a revision to get symptom relief. She then said she would not do it because there is not a &#34;mutual respect&#34;
</p>
<p>
I respected her until she decided to play with my livelihood.

I&#39;m so sorry to hear that. Hopefully others will stay away from her now that your story is out there.

There’s also a point to doing research and carefully evaluating. Pretty much every surgeon has stories of bad experiences. Every single one has people who say to absolutely avoid them at all costs.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had a wonderful interaction with them and I’m extremely satisfied with my results. So that’s 2 anecdotal stories.
</p>
<p>
Both should be heard, and people evaluate if they want to use this surgical team, just like any other.

Just hope it all goes well and you have no complaints because I&#39;m the 3rd person they&#39;ve admitted dropping. Mind you, I had all the same complications you had, minus the fact that you weren&#39;t molested by a resident gynecologist on day 4. Make sure you check for inner hairs they don&#39;t cauterize the follicles like they said they do (not notated in records, other surgeons have said they will always notate thing like that) .
