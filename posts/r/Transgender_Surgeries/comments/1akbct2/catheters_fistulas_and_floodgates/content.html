Okay, it&#39;s been awhile since the last post. Lots of things happened, and i didn&#39;t have the energy to document everything individualy, even tho the fistula thing and a &#34;how to pee&#34; will be usefull info for everyone
</p>
<p>
Context: i got srs 1 month ago at PAI clinic with dr Sutin
</p>
<p>
Sooo, since the last post 3 main things happened, i got back to my country with the catheter still on me, i tot a decently sized abces up my butt crack because &#34;complications&#34; and it was horrible, and i got tossed arround public sanity until i somebody was willing to yank the forbiden hose out of me (and i kinda did it myself). All of this happened in Spain, so if you&#39;re from there you might get the 120% out of this post lmao
</p>
<p>
The flight: Not much to say, the clinic gave me some documents that once given to the airport staff, got me a nice wheelchair and the ability to get carried arround. Going through the airport was easy, the flight not so much. It was unconfortable at best, and the chatheter and the fÃ­stula made it quite painfull. I&#39;d recomed a hearthy dose of painkillers if you have to go back wlth either of this two things happening to you. Other than that, everything went smootly. My bf (well, not really, but it&#39;s not like this post is about labeling relationships :v) came to see me to the airport and i really underestimated how nice seeing a familiar face is after a month of being 7000km away from home...
</p>
<p>
Fistula time!: Thats when the fun begins, so much time with the catheter made my inmune system die quite a bit, even with the antibiotics, and being in the same position for so much time made the zone above my coxis literaly die a bit and well, here ya have a nice abces. It started developing about 2 weeks ago, and obiously i didn&#39;t know what It was, until 6 days ago, when it got worse and sitting or laying on my back started hurting way too much to handle. At least i was home already... It was a matter of getting it drained and filled with gauze by a very brute nurse at my local clinic, going back next day to get it checked and then sent to ER, waiting several hours for a surgeon, getting it drained again, getting STRONG antibiotics, and then getting it cleaned, drained, filled with gauze daily at the local clinic, wich hurts like hell, up until yesterday, and know i just gotta keep with the pills. As easy as breathing as you can see..
</p>
<p>
And the final attempt at removing the catheter: It went well! But it was a mess talking with the doctors here. Unless you&#39;re from spain this info won&#39;t be so helpfull, so i won&#39;t be telling much aside from the technical part. (Feel free to ask tho!

The thing is somebody finally decided that i was not an alien and my utetra doesen&#39;t bite (gotta love the doctors seeing my bits as something menacing...). I was this close to doing it myself... And i kinda did It was a very nice nurse who decided to do it, I did panic a bit, and well, i decided it was best for me to be the one pulling... So there was I, in a gyno chair, pulling the tube out while chitchating with the nurse and my mother being lowkey mad at me for that. The last 2 to 3 cm i let the nurse do, since it was the most unconfortable part, and well, it was out. I got sent home because if it has to go in again, it will have to be at the ER, so it was no use waiting at the clinic. I was tense... But happy, i feelt very good and my not-bf-yet was with me all day wich made me quite relaxed, but i still had to pee ;-; I was able to nicely! I kinda panicked so i was trying to pee while we held hands wich sure was quite a comedical sight, but the flood gates did open!
</p>
<p>
Some tips!: Peeing now feels very diferent. Everything is &#34;uncalibrated&#34; and pushing the &#34;wet&#34; button is still a bit hard. But there is some things i noticed that might be helpfull to all. 1. The tip of your penis is not going to explode (duh), mainly because it doesen&#39;t existit anymore. But it feels kinda like that, the brain doesen&#39;t get used to the uretra and the &#34;glans(now clit)&#34; not being in the same place/same thing. Don&#39;t panic, it may feel like the &#34;tip&#34; that you don&#39;t have is exploding a bit (with a slight pain), but the pee is not being blocked or anything, you&#39;re not feeling your &#34;peehole&#34; anymore, thats a diferent thing now. It may sound dumb, but im quite sure im not the only one that feels it like this. Feel free to prove me wrong tho 2. Your new floodgate doesen&#39;t tell ya shit. Wich means the last 2 to 3 cm of uretra don&#39;t have any sensation (at least for now), so if you&#39;re peeing just bit, or with a tiny stream you might assume you&#39;re not peeing. Look, and try to feel the surrounding area to guide yourself. 3. A massage helps, just above your new bits. 4. Feeling full or empty is a bit hard, keep a mental recoed that helps you thing &#34;ah yes, i should be peeing rn&#34;
</p>
<p>
And thats it, feel free to ask anything!
