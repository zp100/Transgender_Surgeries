I had what is known as the “triple” which is detailed on Dr. Haben’s website

After care includes not speaking for an entire month.  Once you are able to speak you will sound very hoarse at first but it gets better as time progresses.  I don’t have a before voice clip unfortunately but I did have a rather masculine sounding voice.  The scar ends up being difficult to see.  The only people who seem to notice ask me if I’ve had a tracheotomy.  I have Never had any vocal training.  Highly satisfied with result.

Edit:  I completely forgot to mention something that happened post op.  Three years after surgery I developed post nasal drip.  About 5 months later I coughed up what I later learned was a semi-permanent suture.  Maybe I just wasn&#39;t paying attention but apparently that&#39;s normal.  The post nasal drip lessened but didn&#39;t go away.  A year later I coughed up another suture and after that the post nasal drip resolved and everything has been fine since then.  This freaked me out.  Ask about it if you are looking at getting the surgery and they don&#39;t mention it.

When I was considering the procedure I went through all of the examples posted on the website.  They weren&#39;t all what I would consider a good result.

I had a couple questions if you wouldn’t mind because I’m looking for a voice trainer.
</p>
<p>
How do I go about finding a good voice trainer? Should I be seeking someone who specializes in trans females?

Wow thank you so much for this response! This is exactly what I was looking for. I hadn’t even thought about finding someone who can actually masculinize and feminize their own voice.

By never having any vocal training, do you mean that you never had professional help, or that you never worked on it at all? It sounds amazing!

I got a glottioplasty with Haben and frankly the results were pretty minimal, I know vocal coaching is important and I haven&#39;t been able to get it, anywhere, in CNY.  My vocal range is also pretty awful with little top range at all.
</p>
<p>
Results are &#34;Lack Luster.&#34; They did help me pass a little more easily but that&#39;s about it.

double I think, just the  glottioplasty, basically sutures to narrow it off a bit. I know it wasn&#39;t the triple because he didn&#39;t think it was necessary.
</p>
<p>
It might be a lot better with vocal coaching but I can&#39;t yell or sing in a high range and I doubt that&#39;s coming back.

I&#39;m the one that changed things at the Rochester Hospital with Dr. Haben about his attitude towards myself 2020 Sept. and Nursing staff addressing me deliberately in the wrong pronouns being post op SRS 2019 - he&#39;s changed his tune some then !!  my surgery the &#34;Triple&#34; dd not work in anyway - told me to to go read about it in person this asshole on his website , no explanation in person during consult , nothing ??   - bad experience from an arogant &#34;Man&#34;  bottom line  toward me - At my age at the time age 62 I wasn&#39;t taking dirty crap he spun at me back in 2020 - I&#39;&#39;m happy he treated you well but I paid the price and said my piece - my fight on emails and complaints to the Hospital didn&#39;t go unnoticed !! - WOW !! - I had a shitty experience with this SOB !!
</p>
<p>
The Hospital kept quiet , amazing ,  I noticed of my complaints &#34;Hiding&#34; everything also !!  but reading your experience tells me I made some difference for your dignity being there -- I guess it took an asshole like me to change things and I&#39;m labeled a problem patient now but made things better for others !!

I work retail so every customer was a new hell.   The worst being when they would get my attention with &#34;ma&#39;am&#34; and then when I speak they say &#34;Oh sorry, sir.&#34;  I avoided phone calls as much as I could too.

Thanks for replying! I&#39;m in the UK so I&#39;m saving up to get this done at Yeson but this might be a great alternative looking at your results 🙂

This is great!  I&#39;ve been on the fence about this, as I ha e made some strides in speech therapy but not even close to where I wanna be - and it truly feels impossible to get there. The cost seems reasonable too!  How was recovery?
</p>
<p>
I know it was 5 years ago, but do you know what is the wait list like?

Recovery was very low on pain scale.  We drove so on the road trip back if i dozed off and we hit a bump it would hurt but thats about it.  Not being able to speak really messes with comedic timing but Ive always been a text message kinda person.  I scheduled surgery and had it done 3 weeks later.

Can you sing well post-op relative to before?

Vocal range seems to be pretty nerfed.  I sing about as bad now as I did before.  I would have a hard time recommending this procedure if singing a certain way is important to you.  My black metal screech hasn&#39;t seemed to suffer :)

Hey, sorry to awaken a two year old comment but your account still appears active. I am still very early in transition and no where near ready for any surgeries but my frustrations with vocal training makes me strongly consider VFS. Being in the northeast Haben would probably be one of my first consults if I went that direction.
</p>
<p>
One thing I have never seen talked about except for in this comment is the effect on &#34;alternative&#34; singing styles. My regular singing voice is pretty much standard baritone and I can comfortably raise it up and support a clean low falsetto or some of the higher nasally notes. Being a 90&#39;s kid I was musically self taught by learning how to play nirvana songs (as one did at the time) and as a result I have the ability to very easily shift into vocal distortion and hold a sustained &#34;grunge&#34; scream (think: opening yeahs to Lithium). Obviously VFS would kill my baritone voice and I would need to strengthen my higher range if I ever wanted to sing again but what does it do to the distortion and screams? My understanding is that the growl of the scream is coming from the ventricular folds and not the vocal folds themselves. I would love to Imagine my screaming voice shifting into something more resembling of Brody Dalle or Mia Zapata but realistically I wasn&#39;t even sure if it was possible to ever scream again.
</p>
<p>
How is your singing and more specifically screaming voice now at 2yrs out? Do your screams / screeches read feminine? I am not a professional musician by any stretch, more of a song writer who is too dysphonic of their voice to ever sing to an audience regardless of how it sounds. This question is more of a curiosity then anything that would sway my decision on VFS one way or the other.
</p>
<p>
Thanks
</p>
<p>
Edit* 7 years out. My mistake.
