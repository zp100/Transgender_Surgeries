Thank you so much for giving that information ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Today I got carried away and start crying because I feel like shit. Without moving or having a hard time doing things like sit on a chair that where easy and now are super hard.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, I think tomorrow I can get a better view of the results while I shower.

OMG I&#39;m 3 weeks post op. Had a minor revision yesterday so feels like I&#39;m back at square one, just got to be more careful when walking and moving etc. (Remind yourself your body is not invincible.)
</p>
<p>
I remember that pain you&#39;re in and even thinking how I wish I didn&#39;t even have the surgery at all thinking the pain wont go away. It does. And some parts come back and then it goes and comes back and goes. Just make sure you always have some form of pain killer with you at all times.
</p>
<p>
Congrats girl! You did it!!!

Thanks for the suggestion. I will always have some painkillers for that ‚ò∫Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Finally I&#39;m more happy even when I didn&#39;t even took a look at the results. But the surgeon told my parents that it is beautiful so I&#39;m excited to see it now and on a couple of months when it&#39;s more healed

Spain, Barcelona. Hospital barnaclinic+ with Dc. Raigosa. He has more than 300 SRS and the nurses told me that they saw a lot of results and if they didn&#39;t know it was a surgery they will never know it wasn&#39;t cis. So I hope it&#39;s true.

Congrats.
</p>
<p>
And Yup. Tips from a recent post-op vaginoplasty ENBY (I just had mine on 7/21/22.)
</p>
<p>
-Dont be afraid to ask for more pain killers if you need it.
</p>
<p>
-You will not want to get out of bed for 80% of the time.
</p>
<p>
-if you are on opioids, your time to pass stoll will likely be DAYS. don&#39;t worry. As such, make sure you have food. Lack of food doesn&#39;t help your &#34;not passing stool&#34; situation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
WATER. you have a catheter anyways so it&#39;s no Hassel for you to deal with until your 2nd to last day.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
keep your nurses in the loop for when you first pass gas! It&#39;s a good sign to them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
don&#39;t be afraid to hit that call button. If something feels off/wrong, it probably is. A handful of times when a previous nurse visited, the catheter container/hose was not routed well and was not draining. You will feel internal pressure and &#34;bloating&#34; pain. Hit that call button and get them to check it out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
if they gave you those hospital mesh briefs. Hike them up your ass NOW!. I started developing a rash ony cheeks ecause of the material and the rash was so bad I has issues sleeping after a few days. And they forbid me from side sleeping for a long while. (I&#39;m nearly 1 month post-op and still not cleared for side sleeping)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
-you will likely be sleeping a lot your first 3 or 4 days in the hospital. Your body just went through a shit ton of trauma, it needs rest to heal well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Shifting your legs, trying to stand up, shift your body, adjust, etc will be painful.
</p>
<p>
I have a HUGE resource of my initial preoperative experience on this subreddit. You can also see the posts on my profile. There are links to my burner Gmail drive with slideshow&#39;s, resources, documented healing experience and more.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hope this helps, feel free to ask me questions too! üíõü§çüíúüñ§

<p>
When you are in the hospital,  amything other than your back is impossible due to your limited range of movement with all the post- op hospital stuff in you.
</p>
<p>
At home,  get other blankets and/ or pillows and then roll them into a log shape.  This gets placed under your knees and keeps your knees higher than your hips.  This helps encourage your body (and subconscious mind) to stay on your back.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively,  You can also find wedge pillows and put one under your knees also.
</p>
<p>
The idea behind all this is to encourage and tell your subconscious mind,  &#34;sleeping on your side is more uncomfortable than your back.&#34; Also,  anything other than being on your back hurts for the first month.

And also, once the catheter is out... pee OFTEN. Don&#39;t feel the need??? Don&#39;t care... every 45 minutes to 1.5 hrs... just sit and relax, and see if anything comes out.

I had intense pain... meds wouldn&#39;t touch it... and finally I tried before attempting sleep again, and the pain dropped from an easy 9 to a 4....and I only dribbled a few drops. Feel free to look at my posts, or ask any questions... I&#39;ll headed to bed now, but will answer when I can.

Literally, 96 - 128 oz... while on IV, and add another 32 - 64 Oz to that when they took it out.
</p>
<p>
I actually hated the dilauded &#34;8 minute button&#34; bullshit, so I had IV out on the evening of day 2... it was leaving a bad taste in my mouth... but the condition was I drank a ton of water so they didn&#39;t have to worry about dehydration...

I was on &#34;patient controlled medication&#34;... and had to push the button to dose out pain meds.... it was more pain mess than I needed,  and more hassle, so I convinced nurses I&#39;d be okay on standard pain management. Other than one nurse that was against medical pain management, I was able to manage better than with the stupid button.

My surgical team recommended a vibrator used around the surgical area, lightly, to retrain nerves. It really helped with those pains for me.

Ask for an increased dose of pain meds.  There shouldn&#39;t be much pain while you are in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Also, as someone else mentioned, be ready for sudden shooting pains at random times for the first few months, as nerves reconnect.

It hurts more when I sit for lunch. But when I&#39;m lying down I feel better, but what happens is that the painkillers tube is full or so I think because I don&#39;t see it going down on quantity. I asked my doctor and she said she will call the one who is in charge of the painkillers.

hopefully, you have a donut pillow for sitting on, to take pressure off your new vag.  If not, ask for you from the hospital, or buy one!

Ten months post here. Congratulations! Welcome home, girl. ü§óü§óü§ó
</p>
<p>
It gets better, sister.
</p>
<p>
I, too, woke up in the hellscape of 10/10 pain. Pain meds exist for a most compassionate reason. By day 3, I had settled into mostly hospital boredom (I was in for five days).
</p>
<p>
And that ‚Äúphantom dingus‚Äù effect? That‚Äôs also to be expected. Your nervous system has preconceived ideas (for want of a better term) of what is where. After awhile, it will tell itself, ‚ÄúOh. We have a vulva now. That‚Äôs cool‚Äù and the phantom symptoms will disappear.
</p>
<p>
Soon, they will bring you your dilators. You‚Äôll probably gaze upon them in disbelief. Still, somewhere around Day 7 post-op, they will teach you how to use them. Purple will come first. Orange will look like an impossible Everest to you.
</p>
<p>
Treat your dilation schedule like your new religion, though, and you will, in time, summit Everest, as well.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm so happy for you and for all the authentic life coming your way!
</p>
<p>
Rest and heal.

Thank you so much. In my case mi dilators are made of something like glass. I suppose they are different in each place. Now I&#39;m a little bit in pain but I think it&#39;s because of the bandages that compress my stomach. It&#39;s hard af and I want it to be tomorrow so they take them off like the catheter.

Yay you!!!!
</p>
<p>
Have you been up on your feet yet? I had surgery July 5 2022 at 07:30 under regional anaesthetic and a gentle knockout. Woke up about 10:30 in recovery, to my room by noon, standing at bedside before dinner.
</p>
<p>
Painkillers freely available. I never got above about 6/10 or 7/10 and they made me get up and walk the next day.
</p>
<p>
Tapered off painkillers at home by six weeks. Discomfort and stinging sensation and constant low level, consistently slowly diminishing pain.
</p>
<p>
Have had bad knee for 40 years, had surgery on it 1998 but still had pain. It‚Äôs now giving me more pain than my surgery. Have to take painkillers for that, which may be masking some surgical discomfort.
</p>
<p>
Don‚Äôt be stupid. Pain delays healing. Take the painkillers. Best pre-op advice I received. (From an acquaintance who had her surgery not too long ago.)

I think tomorrow they will take out my bandages and finally put something more comfortable and take a shower, clean the wounds and take my first steps... I&#39;m 22 years old so my body is young. So I hope I have a fast recovery, but yeah now painkillers are my best friends hehehe.

I had a similar experience when I had my gallbladder removed. The doctors tried to give me as weak meds as possible like 800 ibprofin because of the politics of opioids at the time. I swear I was so angry from being in pain and being neglected I almost got the nurse fired. They finally caved and gave me a belly pain shot (non narcotic, they could have done that the whole time they were just incompetent) and upgraded my pain meds to dalaudid, my pain went away and I relaxed to the point of just flipping off the nurse while calmly smiling when she was being smug and insistent about the whole event afterwards. Never went to that hospital for anything after that. It wasn&#39;t a normal treatment place for me, I was living in a new and unusual area for me at the time and they just kept transferring me until I ended up there. I&#39;ve had several major surgeries before and after that, never had such a ridiculous thing happen. Imagine waking up from heart surgery and they&#39;re like here&#39;s a tylenol, deal with it
