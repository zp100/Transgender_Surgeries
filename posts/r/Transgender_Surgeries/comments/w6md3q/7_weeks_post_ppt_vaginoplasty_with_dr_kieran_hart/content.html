Literally every surgeon has had sone questionable results - even the ones this sub likes to put on pedestals.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm really of the belief that the less risk factors you possess, and the better mental headspace you‚Äôre in going into to surgery - the better results you‚Äôll have. ‚ù§Ô∏è
</p>
<p>
Obviously this is not true always, not trying to invalidate anyones experience.

Yeah the actual reason I‚Äôm posting this is because most of what I could find online about Hart was negative but everyone I‚Äôve met in person or messaged directly only had good things to say. Every surgeon has bad results and people who are unhappy are most likely to make public posts. The majority who are happy just move on with their lives and never post to groups like this.
</p>
<p>
I totally understand if that‚Äôs still too risky for people, everyone needs to make their own decisions but I‚Äôm very glad I listened to my friends with positive experiences than only online posts

<p>
Yeah. I would definitely agree with that. I‚Äôm over the moon about my aesthetics and healing (0 complications!)
</p>
<p>
You have to take this sub with a grain of salt. There are varied degrees of issues with a place like that - which you mentioned.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs a lot of negative posts about surgeons from women who are dissatisfied with how their outcome aligned with their expectations.
</p>
<p>
There are women who, to them, considered themselves ‚Äúbotched‚Äù if one labia majora is larger than the other.
</p>
<p>
There are also women here who honestly, are kind of angry and nasty to people. I had a run in recently with someone who honestly just must kinda be unhappy with her life to point of being condescending to other women on the internet for reasons I don‚Äôt know.
</p>
<p>
So. This sub is useful for sure. But. You know.

Since I am one, I do not try to invalidate anyone, but I can see where I was a little unclear.
</p>
<p>
The point was that while valid, we are only really seeing those who are dissatisfied with their results.
</p>
<p>
I think to a point, the term ‚Äúbotched‚Äù is thrown around kind of loosely here. I have seen some that may qualify as such, but many are (I think) experiencing healing outside their expectations and therefore ‚Äúbotched‚Äù is the term they relate with.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs one specific woman here who had absolutely horrible, complicated healing and she tends to comment and link pictures to her own healing journey when people refer to themselves as botched. Her healing was amazing in the end.
</p>
<p>
You will read negative reviews about every surgeon - including Wittenberg, Chet, and even yes, Suporn when he was active.
</p>
<p>
I guess that was more of the point instead of trying to invalidate anyones experience with their healing.

Thanks for the reassuring comments, my nerves are going through the roof about seeing him in under 7 weeks now. There&#39;s a lot of mental health problems in the trans community and personality disorders after all. It&#39;s just yeah any time I&#39;m feeling comfortable and settled in my decision after reading plenty of positive things about him, I see someone being upset and it sets the nerves off again.

On top of that, there&#39;s always a few people questioning his capabilities and recommending Thailand. Too late for me to change since I&#39;m flying over there in under 7 weeks üò±

I agree we shouldn‚Äôt have to work out the ‚Äúodds‚Äù, we should know them. Every single surgeon has unhappy patients and bad aesthetic results and I think that should be widely published and explained.
</p>
<p>
I went into this surgery knowing there was a risk of bad aesthetics and complications and decided it was still worth it. I think that‚Äôs the mindset anyone going into any surgery should have.
</p>
<p>
I really am sorry you had a bad experience, I hope you‚Äôve been looking into revision and what else you can do to be happy with it.
</p>
<p>
But while we live in an imperfect world where we all have to calculate our own odds and decide what level of risk we‚Äôre comfortable with I hope people can use both your and my comments to help inform their decisions

Rather than looking at it like playing ‚Äúodds‚Äù, turn it internally.
</p>
<p>
Like, ask yourself ‚Äúwhat can I do in order to have the most success that I possibly can‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
I had PI in Boston, Ma on June 14th. I went to a lot of consultations all over prior to that.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Slama showed me a lot of results - most good, and some not so good (in terms of my own expectations). I asked questions about the women with complications (why/how/when) and then asked him what he thought went wrong during healing that these women could have controlled better.
</p>
<p>
And I got some answers - not all, but some. Sometimes, your body betrays you. Sometimes, it‚Äôs the surgeon. But these surgeons that do this procedure (most of them) know that the community is small, and that we all actively talk to eachother. They know about this subreddit. They know that most of us are educated about exactly what happens during surgery, how it‚Äôs done, and why.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd like to think that no surgeon that does vaginaplasty does so carelessly - aside from a few maybe?
</p>
<p>
As long as you‚Äôre not going to Rumer, I wouldn‚Äôt worry. Talk to the surgeons you‚Äôre interested in. Talk to them ALOT.

To be fair, I had my PPV with Dr. Hart in November. OP&#39;s coochie looks EXACTLY like mine. Like... I momentarily wondered if the post-op recovery pics I sent Kieran got leaked, lol.

If you see any stray hairs I trimmed my pubes so you could see better. So far the vaginal canal, labia minora and clitoral area are all hair free with no laser or electrolysis

Nope, he does PIV and PPT. On the PPT side of things he prefers to do hybrid PIV-PPT which he did with me but will do full or tubularised PPT if necessary

Thank you for posting this. I‚Äôm having my surgery with dr hart in 6 weeks and while I‚Äôm excited I‚Äôm also understandably nervous. Seeing your results is very heartening. Honestly if I look like that I‚Äôll be over the moon. I think you make a good point about taking online forums with a grain of salt but when that‚Äôs all you have it‚Äôs hard.

Hey, I&#39;m at the same point you were when you wrote this haha.
</p>
<p>
Hope everything went swell with yours. Everyone asks if I&#39;m excited and yes I am, but I&#39;m super nervous.
</p>
<p>
Granted my GP said I&#39;d have to be a robot to not be nervous before something as major as this.

Trained under Dr. Bellringer I&#39;m pretty sure so the aesthetic being similar makes sense.

Yeah so I got a hybrid PIV-PPT (penile inversion and then peritoneal pull through for increased depth and some lubrication)

The best thing to do would be to get the latest quotes from both surgeons and calculate it yourself, I‚Äôm in Sydney so travel costs wouldn‚Äôt be comparable and flights/exchange rates/surgeon fees change all the time but if you want the break down of how much it cost me it‚Äôs here

Can I just say that aesthetics wise that is an amazing result. Did you have PPV? I hope mine ends up being just as good, I&#39;m confident in his skills but yeah, nerves are going crazy in the lead up.
</p>
<p>
Only 45 days left till surgery. Fuck. It&#39;s starting to really feel real.
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of people have said that yeah, when you book it a year and a half in advance, it will still feel so far away until it&#39;s just about happening and then it&#39;s all kicking in at once.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really feeling that.

I noticed in a lot of research it‚Äôs recommended to be a low bmi (under 35) or not have much abdominal fat. Did he stipulate this would be an issue or charge extra at all? I‚Äôm only wondering cause I‚Äôve got quite a bit of belly fat im concerned about
