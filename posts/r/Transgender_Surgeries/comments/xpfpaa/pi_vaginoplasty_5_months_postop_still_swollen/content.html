Hi, I had my vaginoplasty by penile inversion method 5 months ago, looking here for ideas of what might be wrong with me. Those are my problems in case it sounds familiar to you:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
At month 2 I was doing better, barely had any discharge or pain and swelling was down. But then I started bleeding again and having a lot of yellowish discharge, usually very liquid but also like some kind of moccus. Sometimes there is also a green stain on my pads. Surgeon says its normal and not to worry.
</li>
<li>
The swelling around the vaginal canal started getting worst and hurts for hours after dilating. I can&#39;t even run because I feel like I have a weighted ball hanging in there. Surgeon says its normal and not to worry.
</li>
<li>
Then there is the blood. I not only bleed when dilating. Several drops of bright red blood come out whenever I sit down on the toilet, specially if I push, then its a blood stream. And sometimes I also bleed through the day. Surgeon says its normal and not to worry.
</li>
<li>
And now I found out I have a pointy portion of reddish skin hanging in there and its starting to almost hang out of the vagina. A few months ago I could feel it with my finger in the inside but thought it was just the normal skin folds. But recently started feeling that skin spike being push in with my finger and then fall down along with it. I can even see it on the outside with a mirror. Surgeon says its a part of the internal skin of the labia majora and the skin didn&#39;t scar over it, that its something normal with a simple fix in a sort surgery and not to worry about it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But Im in pain every day, I worry because it has been like this for months with no improvement, even getting worst and Im afraid I might have some kind of infection. Measured my vaginal pH and its between 9 and 10, which worries me. My surgeon never told me to douche, I just use soap on the outside and never clean the inside. I have been using the same lube (OptiLube) the whole time.
</p>
<p>
For the #4, the hanging skin thing, I had to insist my surgeon a lot to get that answer. I feel like he&#39;s just telling me whatever so I stop worrying and annoying him and Im afraid he is doing the same with every problem I have. First he said it was the urethral lining which is more red. I insisted on the hanging thing and sent a photo of the hanging bit. Then he said that the urethral thing was on the other side, that what he sees is a zone that got swollen due to dilatation because that zone is highly vascularized. I insisted that the skin is not on either side, that its hanging from the inside and sent a video of me moving it around. Then he said the labia majora thing I mentioned before.

Go asap and be examined by surgeon or if he is too far by another doctor. Do this asap.

Why asap? Im lucky Im getting a call consult with my surgeon on november, he didnt even want to do that until a april next year.
</p>
<p>
Two months ago I went to my doctor because of the bleeding and sent me to the gynecologist but they had no idea of what was wrong, never saw a neovagina. Just told me to stop dilating for a few days (but I kept on dilating).

You are being ill served by your entire medical team.  If you have any lgbt assets in your community ask around until you find a good trans friendly pcp.  You need to get the potential infection under control first.   If worse comes to worse go to the ER.

Green and yellow discharge sounds like an infection. Also sounds like you have granulation.

Would you mind saying who you surgeon was?

Yeah it was granulation all along! Its amazing how my surgeon didnt even think of it and instead he came up with other explanations that I never read about. Im very dissapointed for the results and post op care.
</p>
<p>
Surgeon is Jesus Lago, from Spain.

I went to the gynecologist two months ago but didn&#39;t tell me anything about granulation. Its something they can clearly see? They just said that I had a mucus zone that was bleeding a bit and told me to stop dilating.
</p>
<p>
I will say who my surgeon is after my next consult. I plan to write a review of my experience and I still have hope I can get something good to say before posting the name.

You can’t stop dilating. That’s really bad advice. Granulation is obvious if they see it.

Yes! I will post a review in the next few days. It turns out it was granulation tissue all along, but my surgeon didnt care to treat it until recently and he didnt even treat all of it. Never had a look inside until 11 months post op. He also never called it granulation tissue until I asked if it was called like that. He called it &#34;fungoid tissue&#34; or something like that at first. I spent more than 8 months with unnecessary pain, bleeding and dischargue. And a bit of tissue hanging out.

Im at 14 months. Mine didn&#39;t even get a look inside untill month 11th. Now it has been 2.5 months since my consult, the problem persists and Im not getting any kind of treatment at all. Their solution is to have a revision surgery sometime in the future to fix it.
