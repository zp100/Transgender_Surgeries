I had top surgery with her, not FFS, and am willing to answer questions, but I may not be best fit in terms of surgery.

Absolutely not, she said she was going to do small incisions, also put in the wrong size implants, and never gave me information on the type of support bra I needed and then told me I didn’t own the right one the day of surgery, and all it resulted in a Level 2-3 capsular contractur that I’m on medication for, I swear she was not operating at full capacity for my surgery. And the hospital kept misgendering me all the way into the OR so the last words I heard before the anaesthesia were misgendering me.

I had agreed to 500cc implants I woke up from surgery with the certificate that said 520ccs and a seven inch incision on both breasts I can upload what they look like 15 months later if you wish.

I feel like I have seen more bad stories than good stories about all trans surgeons (FFS, SRS, orchi) in NC. Enough so that I won’t consider any surgery in NC at this time.

Would also be curious to hear this since she&#39;s actually pretty close to me.
