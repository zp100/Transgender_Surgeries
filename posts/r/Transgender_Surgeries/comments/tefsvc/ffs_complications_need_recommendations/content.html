Hello. This is a throw away account because my whole experience has been long and frankly, not great by any means. Talking about failed surgeries is also a touchy topic for me.
<br>
I had surgery in 2019 with Dr. Lloyo at OHSU. It was for jaw and chin contouring and rhinoplasty.
</p>
<p>
My experience was really horrible. She didn&#39;t provide the signature jaw braw or any compression after my surgery. What they provided during my immediate recovery in the hospital was a loosely wrapped bandage around my head. I immediately had swelling and a fever. I was sent home for a week and extremely miserable. The pain and swelling wasn&#39;t getting better. I had my followup a week later and she poked and prodded the inflammation, then asked if I had iced it at all. She prescribed me some oral steroids to help with the swelling. I still had a temperature which on call nurses called &#34;normal&#34; for immediately after surgery. I wasn&#39;t aware but the type of steroids she prescribed were in fact really bad for people with anxiety disorders because it can make them worse 100 fold, or that&#39;s what it felt like.
<br>
I spent a few days at home making calls to the nurses because I was concerned that the swelling was getting worse. 3 days after my followup I woke up to discharge in my mouth. It was the most nasty thing I think I had ever tasted. I immediately called the on call nurse but they had an hour wait time. I spent 10 minutes waiting before calling an ambulance and traveling to the ER. I was in the ER for an hour or two and the doctor took a swab of the discharge to make sure it wasn&#39;t something really bad. Dr. Lloyo was not available for the emergency surgery they said would be needed. They had to open up the sutures again and clean the whole incision area, then suture me back up. I didn&#39;t really have a choice in waiting I felt.
</p>
<p>
After the emergency surgery I was notified I had an infected blood clot that was removed. All things considered I&#39;m glad I went to the ER because it could have been life threatening. The fact is though Dr. Lloyo did not take the precautions she should have or gave the proper care. I would 100% NOT recommend her at all for any type of surgery. I had followups after and as swelling went down I noticed my soft tissues around my jaw weren&#39;t settling correctly, or rather they weren&#39;t settling on anything. My supporting structures were removed and she had over reduced my jaw to the point she bilaterally dissected both nerve canals in the jaw and caused nerve damage. I of course was not going to go back to her for more care since she cannot be trusted at all.
</p>
<p>
I spent a long time waiting to see Dr. Berli a more accredited surgeon at OHSU and probably well known around here. I had an attempted resuspention of my chin with him, which didn&#39;t work. He suggested an implant to help with support around the chin. I accepted this plan and I had a surgery putting in the implant and resuspending again. I had concerns about it not being enough since the ptosis was not only the chin, but around the entire mouth. The implant at least covered the exposed nerve, but was not successful in resuspending my mouth. Dr. Berli stated he cannot do anything more for me.
</p>
<p>
I have been in physical therapy for this issue for years while waiting. My physical therapist also has noted the misplacement of the muscle and how I am unable to use the bottom of my mouth due to it.
<br>
There have been other complications like internal resorption of teeth because what I assume is the nerve damage (which hasn&#39;t healed a lot). I have already opened a claim with risk management at ohsu and contacted a lawyer about all this since some things were only discovered when I was seen by Dr Berli. (Dr. Lloyo neglected to mention major problems)
</p>
<p>
My question is does anyone know someone highly skilled who can help with this problem specifically. I have been in talks with my insurance to get coverage outside of network, but I have to find someone to point them to so Dr. Berli can refer me. I&#39;ve looked at several of the surgeons listed in the wiki but getting specifics on them has been difficult and I&#39;m really afraid of getting someone who isn&#39;t trustworthy again. If anyone has recommendations please throw them my way. This has been a very painful process for me and any help would be useful.

Is it possible to have list of surgeons to avoid? I know we have a wiki but it&#39;s so congested. Just a list for bad surgeons should do.

No, it’s asking for trouble doing that. But it’s also import to bear in mind that a surgeons ability is a spectrum from good to bad, and even without the worst ones you’re still left with the merely average and worse. Personally, I think it’s best to avoid risk and go for the best your have access to.

I agree.  One person’s miracle worker is someone else’s nightmare.   We all tens to have different opinions and experiences,   The best folks can do is work thru the wiki, the posts here and ar Susans Place and word of mouth.
</p>
<p>
This Doc seems to be pretty much a newbie.  Many docs are jumping into Trans care now that we get insurance coverage.

There’s some surgeons that there’s not much disagreement over. It’s more that I don’t want to attract legal problems. It’s fine if people write their own experiences, there’s not much surgeons can do about individual reviews. However if I write a list of bad surgeons it’s a much bigger target and I don’t want to get the sub banned or myself kicked off reddit.
</p>
<p>
As for other surgeon it’s very disruptive when I post my opinions so I mostly stopped doing it.

I&#39;m sorry to hear about what happened. How could the surgeon cut both nerve canals when she claims to have all these credentials omg!
