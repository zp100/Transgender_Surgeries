Hello!! I recently got a tracheal shave with Dr. Brandon Baird at the University of Chicago. I couldn’t recommend Dr. Baird and his team more. Baird is a wonderful, respectful person and surgeon. He performed the shave carefully, using the technique where items are inserted to ensure no vocal chord damage and suturing the neck muscles alongside the trachea together for a smoother look. Overall I’m really happy with the look (even with the scar!)
</p>
<p>
Recovery: The incision line is already less noticeable after a week. He does a special procedure to minimize scarring, and my primary care provider commented on how skillfully I had been sewn up. Admittedly, this makes the area look a little bumpy, but after a week it is already less noticeable.
</p>
<p>
In terms of voice, I’ve had some soreness while talking but nothing that limits my pitch. I don’t even have a hoarse voice, it just hurts to move the physical muscles (like when eating bites of food that are too big or yawning).
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps! Feel free to comment with questions.

Glad it went so well for you! Was the incision location even with where your jaw meets your neck? I just had my consult for the procedure to happen in September, and the Doc said that was where he would go in to do the work. It sounded good to me but I thought the incision site was usually just above the trac.
