Posted here before, but using a throwaway account for photos of my genitals for obvious reasons!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m in my 50s and so far very pleased with my shallow depth surgery by Mr Larner.
</p>
<p>
As you might expect at just 5 weeks I still have some swelling, particularly under my right labia and on my pubic bone, making the suture lines look a little asymmetrical. But overall I think that I&#39;m healing nicely.
</p>
<p>
Depth about 1.5 inches, and no hair removal required pre-op. Good sensation, everything feels right. Though too soon to report on orgasms, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too difficult as clitoris feel nicely sensitive.
</p>
<p>
Cost ¬£17,300 and hospital accepted MasterCard! üòÑ

Hi , just asking is the surgery as in &#34;no depth&#34; could you confirm you had a Vulvoplasty!  As this is could be my type of change in near future. Thanks Steph.

I had &#34;Vulvoplasty with a shallow vagina&#34; which has given me about 1.5 inch depth without the need for dilation. It&#39;s not zero depth.
</p>
<p>
The Nuffield website only lists Vulvoplasty &amp; Vaginoplasty - not what I had, which is kind of a half way option.

Thanks, i am down for a Vulvoplasty with GIC, with the Brighton Clinic/Hospital. I was told that the depth cosmetically would be around 1&#34; So happy for you by the way. Bless

Thanks üòÅ

<p>
Yep that sounds like exactly what I&#39;ve just had, and even at just a few weeks I think that my &#34;shallow&#34; vagina is going to give me a lot of pleasure. It&#39;s more than just cosmetic me thinks!
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had just a little (and VERY gentle!) explore, and it felt very pleasant indeed... ü§™
</p>
<p>
If anyone asks me i&#39;m going to say it&#39;s &#34;fun size!&#34;

Hey :) Looking great and I hope to have surgery soon with one of the two Brighton surgeons, for full depth vaginoplasty.
</p>
<p>
Would you happen to know if the 17k cost is current and whether their waiting list is short? The hair removal question may not be applicable I&#39;m not sure but I&#39;m hoping for it not to matter.
</p>
<p>
When I enquired over a year ago it was around 15k and surgery could be offered in as little as six weeks but I had no referrals at the time.
</p>
<p>
Thank you x

Thanks üòÑ
</p>
<p>
I only paid for my surgery last month - so I&#39;d say that the price is just about as current as it gets! But of course I&#39;ve no idea when they review their prices, and as we all know inflation is nuts right now...
</p>
<p>
The ¬£17k fee was the same as I was quoted back before Christmas, so it&#39;s been that since at least last autumn, and I gather it&#39;s much the same for zero, shallow or full depth surgery.
</p>
<p>
Wait wise, once I had my letters it was only about a month for my initial consultation then six weeks after that for surgery.
</p>
<p>
(Those are private wait times of course - longer for NHS but I gather that the service is exactly the same.)
</p>
<p>
Honestly I can&#39;t rate Mr Larner and the Nuffield Brighton highly enough. In my opinion world class, though I conceed that many consider PI to be a little out of date. But as I had shallow depth that was irrelevent anyway.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve not met Mr Coker yet, though I&#39;m told I may see him at my follow up appointment in a few weeks time.

Thank you! All sounds nice and positive :)
</p>
<p>
Can I ask, do they require the payment in full as soon as you book a surgery date or by a certain number of days or weeks before said date?
</p>
<p>
I
<em>
really
</em>
will struggle if it has to be put off for up to a year for hair removal, so I have everything crossed that won&#39;t be the case!

Payment wise - things moved quite quickly for me, with just a few weeks between being offered a surgery date and waking up in the recovery room!
</p>
<p>
But the letter I received after accepting a surgery date said &#34;Payment must be received before you are admitted to hospital&#34;, and I paid over the phone by card about two weeks before my date.
</p>
<p>
I guess if you were booked months or even a year in advance then you&#39;d have to call and ask them what their policy is. Also what would happen if prices go up and whether they&#39;d honour your original quote... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</p>
<p>
I found them really easy to deal with and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be happy to answer all those questions if you call or email them.

Hey!
</p>
<p>
Can I just check, is that payment total all in? I ask because I called Parkside and they said it would be around ¬£28k, which is around ¬£16k hospital fees and then another ¬£12k or so for the surgeon!
</p>
<p>
No way can I afford that :(

Yes - that was everything excluding my initial appointment with Mr Larner, which cost ¬£250.
</p>
<p>
So call it ¬£17,500 all in... Which I think is damn good value, especially if you go for full depth!
</p>
<p>
(I had good reasons for shallow and I&#39;m very happy wity my choice.)

Hey, I&#39;m looking into getting vulvoplasty myself (maybe shallow depth, not sure yet) and I came across this post. I just have a couple of questions if you don&#39;t mind and still happen to receive notifications for a throwaway account.  How have things been down there, have there been any complications? How often do you have to clean the inside?
