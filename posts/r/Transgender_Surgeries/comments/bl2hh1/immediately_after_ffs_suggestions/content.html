This year end, I need to fly to California for my FFS. I will probably be doing chin reduction, rhinoplasty, slight jaw contouring and a brow lift.
</p>
<p>
I have no one, family nor friends, to help me pos-op.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m wondering if it is possible to take a taxi alone?
</p>
<p>
For how long i need to book temporary accommodation?
</p>
<p>
Do I need a nurse? I&#39;m in fairly good shape
</p>
<p>
Should I just stock supplies before my surgery?
</p>
<p>
Would I need to go back to the surgeon post-op, assuming there are no complications?
</p>
<p>
Any other suggestions?
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much.
</p>

You should ask the surgeon about post op appointments. You most likely will have one or two over the first week or so. Also ask about diet, most likely with the jaw work you&#39;ll be on liquid only for awhile, and a day or two before you should stock up on everything you&#39;ll need for the first 10 days or so afterward. For the first few days your face might be wrapped up like a mummy and it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to be going out alone looking like that. Once they get all the wrappings off and your voice recovers you&#39;ll still look like a mess but can then do basic errands. Personally I wouldn&#39;t plan on major travel for a couple weeks afterward.
</p>
<p>
FFS, with everything you&#39;ve listed, is a major surgery and I was so thankful to have a friend with me especially the first few days afterward to keep me eating and manage my pain meds. I was in good shape beforehand but was hardly able to do more than watch videos the first couple days, and my voice was gone for ten days afterward. The physical stress and liquid diet were really hard on my body -- I lost probably 15 pounds very quickly. And a lot of people go through a long emotional recovery as well. With all you&#39;re getting done you should be prepared for a hard recovery and I&#39;d honestly consider seeing if you could convince a friend or family member to help if you financially recompense some of their expenses.

I had FFS about 5.5 weeks ago with a different surgeon, for somewhat more extensive work: sliding genioplasty to shorten, narrow, and increase my chin projection (T osteotomy), jaw contouring, rhinoplasty, type III forehead reconstruction, browlift /w scalp advance, lip lift.
</p>
<p>

Depending on the surgeon, they may require that you have a caregiver available for at least the first 24-48 hrs, I had my wife with me and am incredibly glad that she came, it would have been far rougher without her.
</p>
<p>
I could have taken a taxi alone if I absolutely had to, but I honestly felt like I was made of glass and was mostly focused on existing. Having someone with me was absolutely fantastic. The taxi ride was draining, and I was very glad to get back to our AirBnB.
</p>
<p>
This will depend on your surgeon. My surgeon required a minimum of 1 week post op, and recommended 2 weeks post op. We stayed for about 2.5 weeks due to flight schedules.
</p>
<p>
Not in my experience, but having a travel companion was sooo helpful; picking up things, keeping me sane, etc.
</p>
<p>
YES! Especially with jaw work, you will very much want to have liquid / soft foods available until you&#39;re ready to venture outside (which wasn&#39;t really until about a week post-op for me).
</p>
<p>
I saw him three times post-op before returning home, at 1 week to remove stitches and staples, at 1.5 weeks to follow up on a hematoma, and at 2 weeks for a final followup before heading home (and to get a few stitches that were hidden by scabbing).
</p>
<p>
Take things slowly, the biggest mindfuck for me was feeling like I finally had some energy, doing something minor, and then feeling drained and needing to recover. (ie, having a shower would wear me out completely. Oh, also, be prepared for your hair to be a mess for a bit as you aren&#39;t supposed to get the incision wet for a bit.

I wouldn’t suggest being alone after. I’m a nurse and my friend that’s a nurse stayed w me the first 3 days after and I couldn’t have done it alone. You could always inquire if they know of private nurses or anything like that. You can’t get in a taxi and leave immediately after any type of surgery that I’m aware of someone has to sign to be responsible for u. Even when I have conscious sedation for electrolysis I have to have someone take me home Bc they can’t allow me to get in a taxi legally.

you&#39;ll need someone to care for you afterwards
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
the &#34;gel pea&#34; freeze bags were the best, you&#39;ll want different shapes and sizes, comfort fit ace bandages are softer and more comfortable , have several so you dont run out and can re wrap

I would ask your surgeon these questions. I am in a similar situation and my surgeon said his office has agreements with local home health nurses and such that will take care of you, shop for you, take you to and from your appointments, etc.

I would recommend having someone there to help you for at least the first week. Some girls do it alone, but dont know how they do it. I was a mess for about 5 days. After that I was able to do most things on my own. Although, That wasnt a lot.

From what I’ve seen and slightly lack of seen. Vision without belting or swelling shut should never be a assumption.
</p>
<p>
I have 20/12 eye sight and I felt near blind due to swelling for the first 2 days.
