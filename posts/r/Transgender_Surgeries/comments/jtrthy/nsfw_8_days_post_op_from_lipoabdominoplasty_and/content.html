Nov 5th I had lipoabdominoplasty with muscle repair (tummy tuck) with autologous fat grafting for primary breast augmentation from Dr Zeidler (
<a href="https://zeidlerplasticsurgery.com">zeidlerplasticsurgery.com
</a>
) in Campbell, CA.
</p>
<p>
I had 250cc L / 200cc R of fat injected into my breasts. The fat was harvested largely from the abdomen as well as sides and flanks (back fat) and from some of the under arm areas.
</p>
<p>
I chose these procedures and this surgeon for a number of reasons. I was interested in fat grafting BA because I liked the idea of not having a medical device in me that will require replacement at one point. Another reason is the complication rate of implants (in the latest Sientra FDA trial between  around ~5-25% capsular contracture rate over 10 years depending on type (smooth vs textured) and placement (submuscular vs subglandular) with a typical option of smooth, submuscular have around ~10% (
<a href="https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2018/04001/Ten_year_Core_Study_Data_for_Sientra_s_Food_and.4.aspx">ref
</a>
- fun fact my surgeon is in fact an author on this reference). In addition there is a rupture rate of around 10% over 10 years.
</p>
<p>
These are largely reasons why I did not want implants. Reasons why I *wanted* fat grafting were because it allows for a much greater control of the change in shape as opposed to placing a monolithic object in a various location. I wanted the most natural tactile sensation and having my own tissue I think was one way to help get that as well.I knew that I wanted a tummy tuck and this seemed like an ideal opportunity to have fat removed with it.
</p>
<p>
Tummy tuck while not often considered a gender affirming surgery was greatly desired for myself as having lost around 110 lbs over the past few years I had a persistent overhang of skin at my stomach which made it difficult to wear a lot of the feminine clothes I wished to wear. In addition because I also underwent muscle repair this sutures the abdominal muscles together which creates a more defined abdominal shape and helps achieve a more &#34;hourglass&#34; figure.
</p>
<p>
Dr Zeidler initially appeared on my radar after seeing her name appear positively several times in various fat transfer augmentation facebook groups, researching her I found almost exclusively positive online reviews on yelp / google reviews / realself.  In addition looking through her instagram I was extremely pleased with her aesthetic results.
</p>
<p>
I compiled an extensive consult questionnaire for our consult in July. Talking with her, while she is not a trans specific surgeon she has stated she has had several trans patients and is in general used to working with trans patients. I have been extremely pleased with her as well as her staff throughout this experience.  She answered all my questions readily and was I think pretty pleased to deal with someone so obnoxiously prepared. Some things I like about how she does fat grafting include:
</p>
<p>
Use of Hydrasolve over the standard suction assisted liposuction technique. There is some evidence that this causes less bruising over traditional Coleman liposuction while also being faster and causing less surgeon fatigue (which to me means better patient outcomes)  (

)
</p>
<p>
Use of puregraft which I find appealing over coleman centrifugation somewhat on the basis that it seems like it may better preserve adipocytes (

</a>
</p>
<p>
To note - post op - my abdomen is still intensely swollen - this swelling recede over the next few months. I have full sensation currently in my breasts at this point. There will probably continue to be some development in my breasts over time. Dr Zeidler stated and per the literature there is likely to be retainment - typical good retainment of fat is around 60-80% with Dr Zeidler stating she typically has around 70-80%. She has told me that as my breasts settle they will probably move towards looking less tight and filled and increasingly natural. Though as it stands I really enjoy the change in my breast shape.
</p>
<p>
Recovery:
</p>
<p>
This was a pretty brutal recovery I have to say. I would say this overall has been more painful than FFS though I believe that I am recovering far faster. The initial pain immediately post-op was largely around the tummy tuck incision. As the local anesthesia they gave me for my abdomen faded the next day the pain from the lipo began to predominate. It felt like I had just horrifically pulled a bunch of lower side / back muscles. The pain has begun to recede pretty quickly and I&#39;ve moved from taking a fair amount of Percocet to manage the pain to not having taken one all day today so far, though I will probably take some closer to bed.
</p>
<p>
With the tummy tuck I had to remain bent over as the skin has been pulled tight. I also had to sleep bent over as well. Laxity has been returning and I am standing increasingly upright. Eventually in the next few weeks I will return to standing normally.
</p>
<p>
Because of both the lipo and the tummy tuck I have to wear a compression garment 24/7 and I am wearing a bralette 24/7 as well for the next 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
I will probably in the next few weeks begin manual lymphatic drainage to help with swelling and then in a few weeks after deep tissue massage for lipo recovery.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Future:
</p>
<p>
I am planning on having a second round of fat grafting next year. There is a lot of thought that complications are minimized and retainment is maximized in fat grafting by having smaller multiple rounds than 1 individual round. This is because when fat is grafted the tissue needs to revascularize so the grafted fat needs to be nestled between graft site tissue - one of the ways in which there is a ceiling on the amount of fat that can be grafted in a single time.
</p>
<p>
I know there seems to be an uptick in interest in fat grafting BA so I thought I&#39;d throw in my experience so far with it. Overall I&#39;m very pleased with both the procedure and my surgeon. Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions!

Is the 250/200ml the maximum she could transfer or what you wanted?

We decided to just transfer the amount she could get from my abdomen this time. She told me should could have fit much more into my breasts but we decided that to optimize this we would split the fat up into two parts. She&#39;ll subsequently lipo from my thighs and flanks with my next session.

Sounds good. Any idea what does she typically does if she’s just doing breasts?

She typically prefers to take from flanks / inner rear thighs. Stomach lipo can be sketchy normally because it can cause rippling. How many cc does she get into a breast ? It really depends on how much fat is available and how much the tissue can hold. She does reconstruction cases for instance where the skin is very tight so much less and in those cases you may even use tissue expanders.
