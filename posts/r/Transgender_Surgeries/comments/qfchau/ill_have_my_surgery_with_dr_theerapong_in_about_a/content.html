Hey guys! I&#39;m gonna take Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty and most likely BA with Dr Theerapong and I&#39;ll answer everything you wonder. I might post here while recovering too. I stopped hormones 5 days ago.

Definitely post here, especially post op. Not many have with this surgeon before so it will help others who follow you. And you never know, they might even take care of you better if they know it‚Äôs all going online. This is by far the largest online trans surgery resource.

I will, but I can&#39;t guarantee to post anything few days after operation. I&#39;ll get both SRS and BA at the same time, so I might be immobile for 2 weeks or so

It‚Äôs going to get awfully boring if you can‚Äôt move for long. You‚Äôll need a phone or computer or something. And get Thai data SIM card at the airport if you can.

You might be able to get one in your home country.
</p>
<p>
Since you‚Äôre using a medical tourism service I‚Äôd ask them about it as well. Very few people do that by way, at least not people who post here.

I forgot something btw. I contacted Surgery Revolution. They have been helpful so far. They have helped me with getting an affordable accomodation right across from them, so they can be there right away if something comes up. It costs 1000thb a night. It&#39;s not a SHA+ hotel tho.

Why stop hormones? My surgeon said it was highly unnecessary to stop before GCS/SRS.

It was on the list for preparation before surgery.
</p>
<p>
Preparation prior to surgery:
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¢ Assessment of the medical history (any allergies, serious medical condition and all
</p>
<p>
medications taken both prescribed and non-prescribed), physical examination, and laboratory tests will be performed during consultation.
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¢ Smoking must be avoided for about 3-4 weeks prior to surgery, as nicotine interferes with circulation and will greatly affect healing process.
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¢ You will likely to be asked to stop drinking alcohol, a week before the surgery and throughout your recovery period.
</p>
<p>
‚Ä¢ Avoid taking any medications such as hormones, anticoagulants, anabolic steroids and supplements at least 4-6 weeks to prevent complicating medical factors prior to surgery. Avoid taking aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal supplements as they can increase bleeding.
</p>
<p>
‚Äã
</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s best not to increase the risk of having blood clots (HRT increases the risk, unfortunately. )

You only paid 1200 out of pocket? That‚Äôs awesome may I ask what insurance you had and if he was out of network? I have my consultation with Min Jun in July hoping to get something booked for summer of next year and while my insurance will cover he is out of network so my out of pocket for him is probably going to be pretty high.

Just adding a Comment. I have talked to the doctor. He was Nice. People from Siam Transformative were good too. They have been very helpful. Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be on the hospital from 12 noon, and the SRS will be on 25th of november. I&#39;ll keep everyone updated

I found a promo some time ago, and I&#39;ll pay 532000baht for Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty. It usually costs 582000baht. As far as I understand, Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty provides lubrication without the risks from transferring a part of my colon to my neovagina.
</p>
<p>
Additional cost  if your BMI exceeds normal level:  BMI 24-28 : Plus 30,000 Thai baht , BMI 28-32 : Plus 80,000Thai baht.
</p>
<p>
My BMI is aorund 27 so far, so I need to pay 30000baht.
</p>
<p>
They have caretaking package for 29000 baht as well which includes:
</p>
<p>
Transport
</p>
<p>
Transport including; airport pickup/airport off to hotel, consultation transport (hotel to clinic and back) x3, transport to psychiatrist (hotel to psych and back), transport to hospital (hotel to hospital and back)
</p>
<p>
Nurse Pre-op, Post-op, and Aftercare
</p>
<p>
Nurse accompanies the patient to all appointments and remains with the patient at the hospital and during the surgery to ensure effective communication between patient and hospital staff. Nurse provides aftercare for 10 days, which includes wound care and dilation 2x per day (morning and afternoon). 1,000 baht per day additional charge if the patient chooses to add additional after-care days with the nurse.
</p>
<p>
SRS Patient Psychiatrist Clearance
</p>
<p>
Psychiatrist determines patient is psychologically prepared for SRS surgery
</p>
<p>
SRS Patient Medical Supplies Kit
</p>
<p>
Lubrication, dilator, condoms, wound dressing, saline, betadine, gauze, gloves, bed pad
</p>
<p>
They also a complimentary day tour with staff before departing to their home country. This can be customized to the patient‚Äôs interests.
</p>
<p>
-----------------------
</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;ll get the aftercare for a month or until I can move comfortably. I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;ll pay for BA yet, or if I&#39;ll get it this time (I&#39;m planning to do it so that I&#39;ll be done with both at the same time and not to stop taking hormones twice)

Hello, Dr. Teerapong is on my short list for SRS (PPT), I have some questions: What made you choose Dr. Teerapong over other Doctors? Why did you choose PPT over the other techniques? What techniqu of the peritoneum are you going to have the complete one (where the entire canal is made of peritoneal tissue) or the hybrid technique (where a part of peritoneal tissue and another part of tissue are used either from the skin of the penis or from the scrotum)? that&#39;s all, I wish you a painless recovery with very good results.

I checked the
<a href="https://siamtransformative.com/sex-reassignment-surgery/" rel="nofollow">website
</a>
again about the procedure, and it says: &#34;Peritoneal Pull-Through Vaginoplasty is currently the most advanced MTF surgery. It is based on the Davydov Procedure. During the PPV surgery, the peritoneum, the moist inner lining of the abdominal wall, is pulled down between the rectum and prostate, to create the vaginal lining and vaginal reconstruction. The remainder of the vaginoplasty procedures (labiaplasty, clitoroplasty, penectomy, orchiectomy, partial urethrectomy, and other associated procedures) are created from a scrotal skin graft, similar to that of the penile inversion technique.

I was originally planning on having sigmoid colon vaginoplasty due to depth and lubrication, and Dr Theerapong has one of the lowest prices for that, and I think his results are really good. I chose PPT since it has lubrication without the bad odour and without cutting a part of my intestine. I&#39;m not so sure about the technique, but I&#39;m hoping for good enough natural lubrication
