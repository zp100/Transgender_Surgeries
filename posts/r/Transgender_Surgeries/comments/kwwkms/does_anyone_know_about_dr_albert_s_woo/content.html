My father personally works in the Lifespan Hospital, and knows of Woo: hes a skilled facial reconstrution surgeon however it is worth to note he isn&#39;t specalized in transgender care or surgery.
</p>
<p>
Thundermist locally refers to them, and personally I&#39;m working out a way to meet with them to talk about surgery options.
</p>
<p>
Tell me how it goes :) (Edit: Woo isnt my dad)

did you have FFS with Dr Woo?  Thundermist referred me to him but I might look elsewhere depending on his skill set. Would love to hear anything about him.
