Bowers is one of the pioneers, but i have heard that she is stuck on older methods.  BBL is considered one of the best in the world.

Dr Min Jun‚Äôs stitch work is better than RBLs they both do the same technique, he does everything himself as opposed to RBL having Dr Zhao help with the Robot, cuts the time down for surgery as opposed to Jun, honestly can‚Äôt go wrong with either. It‚Äôs just a longer wait for RBL. I had a consult with both and ended up choosing Min Jun for aesthetics and location, places to stay are cheaper in San Fran than in New York for post op.

Oooh that‚Äôs good to know. I did know that he trained with RBL and was in SF. I wasn‚Äôt sure nor heard of reviews by him. But it‚Äôs nice to know about that. I just don‚Äôt want to be so focused on one surgeon and ignore other options. So I‚Äôm reaching out for suggestions. I‚Äôm also starting sessions with my therapist tomorrow for the letters!

Yes it‚Äôs always best to have options. I had about 4 but I kept going back to Min Jun because of his aesthetics and stitch work. It‚Äôs a life changing surgery and I want to make sure the best possible way to have this be a one a done procedure, but I know revisions are sometimes needed. He‚Äôs one of the best in my opinion, he is a literal artist.

Had surgery with her 3 years ago, and had a revision done 3 months ago by her too.
</p>
<p>
Super happy with the results / function, but she left too much erectile tissue around my urethra at first. I also had a stitch pop (not her fault), which caused my skin to heal in a weird shape the first time. I got a revision to fix the skin thing, she wanted to remove the extra erectile tissue too, and I‚Äôm happy with the revised version. Retained full sexual function through all of this. Dealing with the complications for 3 years was quite unpleasant though
