Hello Everybody,
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I started this thread to inform you about the SRS surgery done by Dr. Schaff in Muenich, Germany.
</p>
<p>
I just got my first appointment with him and I will definitely have my SRS done by him and his team. Here&#39;s the status so far:
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
November 2018:
</strong>
first telephone call and face to face appointment scheduled for 1st of March 2019. The waiting period for the F2F meeting was the shortest possible, unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
March 1st 2019:
</strong>
The F2F meeting in Muenich at his office.
</p>
<p>
I had to wait for 2 hours more after the time of the appointment due to the queue but in the end it was worth it. The staff was extremely friendly, asking constantly if we (me and the other patients) want water, coffee, etc. The office is situated in a central area near the main train station (Hauptbahnhof).
</p>
<p>
Finally I got in his office and to gain time one of his assistant asked me a series of questions related to: what medicine am I taking, if I smoke, my personal information, etc.
</p>
<p>
After 5 minutes Dr. Schaff entered his office, closed the doors and we started the discussion. He asked me very polite, how am I, what do I do for living, where I&#39;m from, etc. After that he started to present a small history of the Penile Inversion technique, what most of the doctors do and what he is doing. He took a look at my junk, analysed it and gave me his feedback. He described with details what his procedure consists from, what are the advantages, showed me pictures and power point slides and also some complication examples. He also went through all my medical history and wrote down or made copies of every paper I gave him. Compared to other doctors he was extremely patient and explained in every single detail all the answers he gave me. Here and there he made jokes, laughed, he behaved like a person who wants to treat you in the best possible way and take care of you. The whole discussion was full of smiles and very accurate information and pieces of advice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The outcome is the following:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Planning:
</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
For the planning the following documents are needed:
<ol>
<li>
Letter from the psychologist who is in charge of my therapy . Unfortunately I need 1.5 years of psychological therapy to get the things moving :( (will be able to get it latest by December this year)!!
</li>
<li>
Letter from other two psychologists -&gt; this will be needed by the German insurance company (optional if you pay by yourself)
</li>
<li>
A letter called &#34;Operationsindikation&#34; - indication of surgery which is mandatory for him and the insurance company
</li>
<li>
A written statement from me: why do I want this surgery.
</li>
<li>
A letter from the endocrinologist -&gt; Insurance company (optional if you pay by yourself)
</li>
<li>
Approval of the treatment plan from the insurance company (optional if you pay by yourself)
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
After these documents are all ready I will be entered on a waiting list who can be up to 1-1.5 years.
</li>
<li>
Before the date of the surgery (approx. 1 month) a deposit of ~3000 EURO must be paid to his account (this is his fee and not reimbursable by the insurance company).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
The method (Improved penile inversion):
</strong>
</p>
<p>
The technique he described, as far as I understood and studied the other doctors, is one of the best in the world, even better of the Indian surgeons. This is only in comparison with the penile inversion techniques and not other ones like sigmoid  colon for example.
</p>
<p>
He invented this method 12 years ago from the classic penile skin inversion method which he used for some decades (I think more than 20 years). His new and far better method consists in:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Using a section of the penile skin to create the labia minora
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The head of the penis to create the clitoris (but in a different way preserving a lot of nerve tissue). As the female clitoris has ~4000 nerve endings, the penile head has about some hundreds but on a bigger surface. His technique is to make some incisions in the area of the penile head with most nerves to create the clitoris.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The rest of the penile tissue will form a part of the vaginal canal (neo vagina). The difference between his technique and the rest of the surgeons (he mentioned even dr. Supporn) is that he DOES NOT stretch the penile skin which means it will not kill nerves or create any kind of tension!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The rest of the neo vagina is formed using the scrotum. He removes all hair follicles and the scrotum tissue will be stitched to the first section of the vaginal canal using a microscope (nerves, vessels, everything).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If more tissue is needed he can take extra to complete the vagina from other parts (forgot from where he mentioned).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Another difference and great improvement of his method is that he uses the URETHRA to create the vagina. This means my vagina will get wet when aroused and self lubricate!!! This is verified by other posts on dr. Schaff, if you google it, by his patients. The urethra together with a small surrounding section of the bulbo-spongios muscle is linked in the new vagina.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
He builds the entire vagina outside. He makes all vessel, nerve connections and afterwards he put&#39;s the whole thing inside and closes.
</p>
<p>
The surgery is done in 2 stages: first stage is the major one in which most of things are done, 2nd stage is for revisions (dog year reduction of the labia majora, etc).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The result:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
- no tension in the vaginal or the external tissue (labia minora, majora, or clitoris)
</p>
<p>
- self lubrication
</p>
<p>
- gets wet when aroused
</p>
<p>
- depth of 15-20 cm
</p>
<p>
- CIS gender woman aspect (fooled even the gynecologist doctors)
</p>
<p>
- high percentage of orgasmic results (as far as I read over the internet more than 90%)
</p>
<p>
- fewer complications
</p>
<p>
- surgery is done in state of the art hospital in Muenchen, Germany
</p>
<p>
- the vagina has also width (not narrow or tensed) which makes penetration easier, less painful and enjoyable
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
He showed me results with patient inserting a 16 cm dilator with one finger in the vagina after 3 months from the surgery, without any effort. All the results I&#39;ve seen were incredible (looked like CIS woman&#39;s vaginas)!
</p>
<p>
He is working together with Dr. Morath. They form a circle with other doctors in Germany in which they constantly discuss about techniques and improve them.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Dr. Schaff will soon retire from activity leaving dr. Morath who has almost 10 years of training and few years of practice and another doctor (forgot his name), to continue his work. He smiled and promised me I will still catch him in business when I will get my new vagina :))).
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Conclusions:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
- This is just my personal experience. Dr. Schaff is not God or the best possible in the world but he is among the best plastic surgeons in the world. For sure there are good surgeons in India, Thailand, US, Germany or other countries which can challenge dr. Schaff&#39;s job and provide same or maybe better results.
</p>
<p>
- I was very satisfied over the job, results and the way I was treated so far. I&#39;ve read only good things about him (this doesn&#39;t exclude the fact that there might be unhappy patients).
</p>
<p>
- This surgery is 90% covered by my German health insurance and this makes me very happy
</p>
<p>
- The surgery is done in Germany under one of the best health care systems in the world. This gives me more security in case something goes wrong and I would be needing extra care, sick leave or , I hope not: problems solved in a legal way through lawyers. The risks of having such a surgery in Europe (western Europe countries with a state of the art health system) are much lower than having it in cheap locations.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The drawbacks:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
- I am expecting a high cost of the surgery but since the insurance company pays I will not have a problem
</p>
<p>
- Waiting period is high (1-1.5 years from the moment of submitting all papers). He has hundreds of patients per year doing plastic and reconstructive surgeries in his clinic.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I am now waiting for his cost estimation and treatment plan and I will keep you posted :D . I really hope this is good information for you and like I said before this is just my personal experience and opinion. Try to get all the information you need, consult more doctors and after that decide what&#39;s best for you regardless of what people say on forums :) .
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Kiss you all!
</p>
<p>
Take care.
</p>
<p>
Alice

<p>
I had a great experience overall. The nurses and the doctors are very nice. Whenever I had concerns they would calm me down with reassuring words. I felt it was very easy to trust their knowledge on common occurences, like swelling.
</p>
<p>
I shared my room with another trans woman my age. I was annoyed by that at first, but it turned out she was a very lovely person, who was easy to talk to. Pretty sure, there&#39;s always two patients doing the first stage of SRS on the same day.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
how was the surgery
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So my surgery was scheduled first that day. The day before we weren&#39;t allowed to eat at all and we had to take the bowel prep, which yes, it does taste absolutely awful. I woke up after a restless night and immediately got to take the no-fucks-given-pill. After a short waiting time the staff moved me. For the anasthesia, they insert a needle in your hand, which stays there for the whole stay. At that point I laid there, the pill worked by now, I was calm and just chatting with the anasthesist. He put an oxygen mask on my face and I was told to take deep breaths. After about 3 breaths I was out.
</p>
<p>
I woke up in a room with multiple other patients, that also woke up from surgery. We were supposed to drink water, very little and very slowly, but since I had a huge thirst I emptied a small bottle, just to throw up into a bag they gave me. Totally worth it though. Eventually I got moved back to my room. The rest of that day consisted of drinking very slowly and letting the anasthesia wear of. There was pretty much no pain that day.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
pain management
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They give you strong painkillers to swallow in the morning, noon and evening. Most of the time those were enough for me, but whenever I went to sleep I would ask for more, which they would happily give to me, just to be completely painless.
</p>
<p>
After a few days we were allowed to walk around. The first few times a nurse would accompany us, just to make sure, but after that we were free to move around the hospital. Standing hurt a bit and the catheter was obnoxious to carry around. 1 Month post-OP I still get some pain after long periods of standing.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
waiting time
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This one is tricky. I went to my appointment 3 to 4 years ago and apparently they took that date as a reference for the waiting list, even though I had none of the requirements ready yet. I sent them everything they needed just around christmas and in early January they gave me two calls. At first they wanted to give me a surgery date for May, but a few hours later they said, there would be a date open just in two weeks. I took that offer and had to get the preparations within that time. The paperworks you are supposed to take with you include a EKG, blood tests etc. Your Hausarzt is supposed to be able to give you everything on that list.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
how long in hospital
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I stayed 16 days in total, with arrival and departure included. My roommate left a day after.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
how are your results
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, I&#39;m waiting for the second surgery to fix my outer labia. I have what people call dog ears. It&#39;s leftover skin they leave on each side on the top. They told me, since it is a two stage surgery, they would always opt to leave more skin than neccessary, because it&#39;s better to have leftover skin than to lack skin for asthetic fixes. Other than that I am happy with the way it looks so far, but I am definitely eager for the second stage.
</p>
<p>
Functionallity-wise there is nothing I can complain about. Dilation is painful only for the first few days and it gets gradually better, to the point were it&#39;s kind of pleasurable if I was to get into the mindset. I get very wet, way more than I expected. Even though I probably shouldn&#39;t I was able to have sex with my boyfriend already with no lube required. My clitoris doesn&#39;t have full sensation yet. I can whatsoever report an ability of getting an orgasm.

Hello everyone, I got very excited as I was reading your experience.  I am also planning to make appointment with the same Dr. like yours.
</p>
<p>
Can you also please tell me if I am on the right way....
</p>
<p>
I am doing Psychotherapy up to now, its more than a year already, and I was adviced to go to Endokrinology and have 6 month hormone therapy. I had appiintment today and the dr. told me I dont need to go for 6 month hormone therapy coz I have been taking hormones for couple of years already and I just need to get confirmation from my hausarzt who used to give me rezept for hormones.
</p>
<p>
Now my plan is to get apply for the kostenübernahme to the Krankenkasse for my OP. I have a letter from my Psychiatrist, confirmation from my Hausarzt and letter from Psychotherapeut. Am I on the right way?? Thank yoy
