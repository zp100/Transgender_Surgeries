As we all know dilation after a vaginolasty, especially in the first few months is extremely important; with many doing it for ~15 minutes 3-7 occasions daily.
</p>
<p>
If one went for an average of six fifteen minute dilation sessions, thats a total time of 90 minutes per day.
</p>
<p>
Is there are real difference between a single 90 minute session, or perhaps two 45 minute sessions VS all the little short sessions spread through out the day?
</p>
<p>
I ask not just because of my curiosity but my own post-op care.
</p>
<p>
Also, unrelated, but is dilating using estrogean n cream still a thing worth doing? Should I ask my doctor for a prescription cream
</p>

I have never seen actual scientific data comparing the effectiveness of different dilation schedules. My hunch is that every surgeon just makes their own recommendations based on their personal observations. My surgeon has me on 3x 30 minutes a day. The first 15 with purple, and the last 15 with orange. She also told me that it was much better to do a short session than to skip one. That being said, life gets in the way, and I am not great about getting all three in. I miss one occasionally, but I have not lost any width or depth yet...

My dilation was (IIRC) 3x a day in the beginning. Using the SS regular #1. I had problems, partially due to swelling, and partially due to getting lube inside. I watched a YouTube video and realized the patient was using the smaller petite #2 orange, so I ordered the petite set, and sure enough dilation became much less problematic. So initially, I was using those two, with instructions to achieve what was possible, but don&#39;t try to force things (which might cause healing sutures to rip). Sometime down in the second month I added regular #2 (blue) as the swelling subsided. Eventually added regular #3. About 4 months out, I tried regular #4 (orange). At first it was painful, but I learned what was possible and what was not possible. Currently (at ~16 months) regular #4 is used a couple times per month, and insertion depth is 2.5-3.0 dots. No pain, just that&#39;s how far it goes.
</p>
<p>
From 3 months out to 7 months, I was dilating twice per day. At 7.5 months, when I was released, and I dropped back to once per day. As of yesterday, I&#39;m now going to relax my schedule to once per day, and skip every third day, with an eventual plan of every other day.
</p>
<p>
My dilation pattern is to begin with petite #2, to make sure lube is spread around inside, then I play &#39;piano scales&#39; with regular #1, #2, and #3, up and down the sizes, for 15-20 minutes, Following that I douche to clean out the lube. In the beginning I was using a basic vinegar douche, but I now refill the bottle with purified water, and only occasionally use a vinegar douche.
</p>
<p>
I use two lube products, both of them are similar (sterile, water based) but one (in a capped tube) has a rather thin viscosity, and the other (5 gm disposable) is slightly firmer. On different days, I will grab for one or the other, depending on my mood. Both contain methylcellulose. I recently purchased a different brand of 5 gm disposable, which did not contain methylcellulose, and found it to be
<strong>
unusable
</strong>
for my needs. It may be a fine lube for some circumstances, but it caused the dilators to grab instead of slide. YMMV
</p>
<p>
In the beginning, I was easily spending 2 hours per day dilating, partially because of the schedule, and partially because of swelling and trying to find a comfortable rhythm.
</p>
<p>
As to one long session vs several shorter ones, I would lean towards multiple sessions, unless your schedule precludes that. You are trying to teach your body to accept the new normal. Until it learns, don&#39;t give it enough time to try to revert.

I asked my pelvic physical therapist this question after I had GRS, and she said it&#39;s actually both. While nobody&#39;s entirely sure what the
<em>
optimal
</em>
amount is (hence why every surgeon seems to have their own dilation schedule), that both frequency and duration do play a part, especially in those first few months.
</p>
<p>
FWIW, I started off at 3x daily, for 15 minutes at a time. That eventually went down to 2x daily, once a day, and now I only dilate like once a week (I do have a very active sex life though, otherwise I&#39;d probably dilate a bit more.) I was on the largest orange #4 dilator by week 8. I never lost any depth from what my surgeon gave me, and never had any issues. Some folks have to dilate a
<em>
lot
</em>
more because that&#39;s what their surgeon says to do. Unfortunately there&#39;s very little solid data to reference.
