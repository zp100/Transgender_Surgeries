In case you missed it, I&#39;m keeping a diary of my time at GRS Montreal and sharing it here for you lovely folks to read. I&#39;ll answer and comments or questions I get. Otherwise, just enjoy the show.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t sleep well last night, though I never do the first night away from home. Our hotel window is at the front, so I got to watch the Ubers arrive at 6am for today&#39;s intakes. If you have green curly hair, I hope everything went well for you!
</p>
<p>
Breakfast at the Holiday Inn was fine, though the voucher only covered myline, so beware. I also found myself looking for other trans people in the dining room, then feeling bad if I clocked them too easily. We spent the day - as many probably do - wasting time at the mall across the street. It&#39;s like 95% clothes shops, but we found the nerd store and had a blast in there.
</p>
<p>
Currently lying in bed before taking the 2nd enema and having the first pre-op shower, then another early night. My body reacts to stress with diarrhea anyway, so the enamas feel unnecessary at this point xD. The booklets say to fast since midnight tonight, but on the video consultation the nurse said the sooner the better, so I just ate a whole pizza at 2:30 and called it quits.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally, I think we kept busy enough to just keep my mind off of everything. I hit 12K steps, which makes up for the last 2 days. Even now, I&#39;m just tired more than anything. I think I&#39;ve reached the point where stress and excitement have burnt out and I just want to get tomorrow over.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it, tomorrow&#39;s the big day. If I don&#39;t post, assume I&#39;m knocked out on morphine.
</p>
<p>
SURGERY DAY!

You are going to do great!  In the morning, take some deep breaths then head over there and get what you have worked hard for.  Congratulations!  ðŸ’œðŸ’œ

The first 5 days are rough, but it will get better once the packing/stent/cath get taken out and you feel human again.
</p>
<p>
Good luck in there tomorrow!
