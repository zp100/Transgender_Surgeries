I&#39;m not sure if posts like this are allowed but I think it could be a helpful to someone. So I&#39;m about 11 days out after getting breast augmentation and I love my results. I could actually cry out of joy looking into a mirror right now. And these aren&#39;t even my final results! But when I&#39;m not looking into a mirror, I find myself struggling with the recovery process. The first 3 days after surgery were hell and I was NOT expecting it to be as painful as it was. It sucked. What I&#39;m currently struggling with now is not being able to sleep as good as I could before surgery and it&#39;s driving me crazy. I had to sleep upright for the first week and let&#39;s just say I didn&#39;t get any sleep during that period. I got the approval to sleep on my sides now which has been a million times better, but I still cannot get comfortable. Idk. Maybe I&#39;m being weak and whiny. But I also feel debilitated by my lack of being able to be as mobile as I was before surgery. It just feels like I&#39;ve disabled myself to some degree. I hope that&#39;s not offensive of me to say. I know logically that this isn&#39;t forever and to allow myself to heal and things will be great after recovering completely. But I just feel like I need emotional support right now from those of you that might understand how I&#39;m feeling. Thank you for listening and letting me vent.

You are not the only one, any surgery is tough. BA is no joke, my friend said that for her it was more painful, and worse than SRS!! Stick in there, it will get better.

Honestly now I&#39;m scared of how debilitated I&#39;ll feel after SRS plus dilating and all. But if this is the worst of the worst I can do it. Thank you!

I&#39;ve been amazing! I love my boobs. They are perfect to me. Totally worth the pain. I underestimated just how much breast augmentation would alleviate my dysphoria. It&#39;s not just the physical that has changed, my mental state has improved drastically. I&#39;ve been stable and am slowly weaning off my antidepressants. So overall, I&#39;m happy :)

Thank you so much for your kind words! And yes! Getting in and out of bed is so hard, and I need a second from sitting to standing to get used the stretching/pulling feeling. I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your complications, you&#39;re a real trooper for getting through it. It&#39;s inspiring. I stopped taking the prescribed medication after 5 days as I didn&#39;t want to become addicted, and I feel like they did nothing for the pain and only made me drowsy, which helped me sleep for about 1-2 hours at a time. I&#39;m now taking ibuprofen which I&#39;m doing okay with. And thank you again!

It’s different for every one I was just sore a bit after my bad but what I found that helped me sleep was lots of pillows. I put a bunch of pillows behind me to elevate me and then I put two pillows one under each arm and that helped me a bit. Took about a week before I could sleep one my side kinda

Lucky! I had about three pillows behind me and one under my knees.  On my sides I have to be in a very specific position or it feels sore.

Omg! I salute you for your strength. I&#39;ve almost come to tears myself. And thank you! How is the pain of FFS compared to BA? Because that&#39;ll be my next endeavor, but I feel like it won&#39;t be as bad because at least I&#39;ll have my mobility. Am I wrong for thinking that?

I’m with you girl, I had my FFS 3 months ago and the first days after surgery were brutal. I almost didn’t sleep at all the first two nights and I had no strength to even talk or eat for the rest of the day. And for at least one week sleeping was a nightmare. I know you already know it but patience is the key (in my case after 3 mo. I still have bruises under the eyes, I’m probably the worst case ever in terms of recovery time and when I see pics of girls that after two weeks are perfectly healed you can imagine how I feel...). But we’re strong, girl, never forget that we’re the strongest human beings and after this we’re gonna have the guts to undergo another big and invasive surgery! A big hug!
