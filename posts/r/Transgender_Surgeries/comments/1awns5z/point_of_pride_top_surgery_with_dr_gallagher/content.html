For the record, this post on 22 February 2024 by Away_Zookeepergame46 says (my hilighting)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Is it true that you can get a free top surgery with Dr. Gallagher through point of pride? I saw something about that on here. My fiance had surgery with her last year and had an incredible experience. The results speak for themselves.
<strong>
<em>
I really want her to do my surgery but I just can’t find $10,000 right now.
</em>
</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It wasn&#39;t immediately visible due to this subs filters.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Away_Zookeepergame46 makes a comment on a post over on
<a href="/r/ftm" rel="nofollow">r/ftm</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Point of Pride paid for my top surgery with Dr. Gallagher last year and I couldn’t be more grateful, they saved my life

</p>

<p>
And in reply to my question
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Are you aware that Dr Gallagher has quite a number of complaints?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve read a lot of the complains on Reddit and they seem shady and inconsistent. I can only speak to my personal experience.
<strong>
<em>
My results are phenomenal and I was really impressed with the pre surgery and after surgery care
</em>
</strong>
that I was offered.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And other comments by Away_Zookeepergame46
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve read so many good and bad comments on here. It’s crazy. My experience was honestly 10/10. Everyone in the office was so professional, everything went smoothly and there was lots of follow up &amp; after care.
<strong>
<em>
My results are way better than I expected.
</em>
</strong>
It’s a shame she got a bad rep. She did at least 5 surgeries for point of pride last year completely free. A lot of doctors wouldn’t bother
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this by another user
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can only speak to my experience but there’s something shady af about that whole thread. If that was true she would have been investigated and point of pride wouldn’t want to work with her. Loads of rumors snowballed. It went from one guy getting a revision to her killing several patients. Bsfr

And in reply to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSurgery/comments/1axbnqx/the_truth_about_top_surgery_with_dr_gallagher/krmxt9z/?context=3" rel="nofollow">this</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
maybe she&#39;s learned since her past indifference nearly killed a patient.
</p>
<p>
why did you write &#39;the truth&#39; in your title?

<p>
I just think she gets a lot of hate and it’s just one patient story that blew up. Every single doctor has patients who need a revision. wanted to highlight that she’s doing this work for free and a lot of people actually have had an amazing experience w her
</p>
<p>
I guess no 1 will ever fully know what happened but to be fair she can’t give her version of events because it would be a HIPPA violation. I’m pretty sure she did apologize and address some of it on TikTok at the time. People can only truthfully speak about their personal experience, there’s a lot of people jumping on the hate train. For me personally I had a genuinely good experience and would recommend her.

<p>
A bit later on
<a href="/r/TopSurgery" rel="nofollow">r/TopSurgery</a>
there&#39;s a post by a new account and &#34;different&#34; user Big_Significance9799
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I got my double incision top surgery drain free in November last year and it literally saved my left. I&#39;m so happy with my results... After surgery dr gallager gave me her personal cell phone number ( that&#39;s crazy ; no doctors do that)...

<p>
It goes on to heap lots of praise on Gallagher.
</p>
<p>
Away_Zookeepergame46 makes some replies in there (in support).
</p>
<p>
Both posts were deleted not long after that.
