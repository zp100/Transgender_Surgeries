I too have a highly active lifestyle, and that is part of what is motivation for surgery. I find myself in gendered spaces a lot a the gym, pool, backpacking hostels. Being able to better blend would seriously reduce anxiety and time trying to find a private place to change.  The healing tome is a huge concern of mine. I will be missing ski or mountain biking season and that is upsetting.  But the sooner i am done, the faster i can just exist without the baggage that I&#39;m carrying today. Dilation will suck but having talked to post op friends irl it does get both easier and better.  So one year of suck vs the rest of my life.

So, fwiw I used to belong to a trans roller derby group.  There were a bunch of gals that were back on skates after 6weeks. That is an extreme timeline, but something to consider.

Really think hard girl before getting the surgery.  SRS is major  reconstruction. There are risks,  complications and major after care  involved post op. Post-op depression is also very common after SRS. Initially, I went into this surgery feeling excited and  happy and that my post-surgery experience would be that “everything is  great now!” That isn&#39;t the case. I   had my SRS almost two years ago and I experienced immediate   complications. Truthfully, I was  indifferent about getting the surgery.   But I did it because I was tired  of people asking me if I had the   surgery and I didn&#39;t want people to  question who I am as a person.   Getting the surgery just validated me as  full woman. But, at the same   time there were some cons too. My sex drive is non-existent, Dilation is  painful and there is a lot of maintenance and aftercare. Also you are easily prone to getting a UTI   because the urethra is now shorter. Honestly,  I miss  how   effortlessly going to the bathroom was before the surgery. Looking back I wished that I   would of enjoyed the process and journey of  my transition. Had taken   more time on making that surgical decision,  spoken to more individuals  who had  undergone the surgery and really did my  research. I went into  it blind   and didn’t ask nearly as many questions  as I should have.
</p>
<p>
Do you have genital dysphoria? If your ok with your genital then I would tell you not to do it.
</p>
<p>
Now that  its said and done, I don&#39;t regret transitioning but I do  regret having the  surgery. We take things for granted in life. Until  something goes wrong.  The outcome is not always rainbows and sunshine.  If I could turn back time knowing what I  know now I would of not gotten the surgery. Just really take  your time and  think hard  about it. Best of luck moving forward and  whatever decision  you make.  And remember at the end of the day, its  nobody&#39;s  business   what&#39;s between your legs.

Yep, I&#39;m also holding out for the stem cell thing. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad option. SRS is a major life-changing desicion, could be worth it to wait for the best possible outcome. If they never make it, oh well, maybe my standards will change as age.

Have you talked to your doctor about this? There are things you can do about this, you don&#39;t have to just live with it! Things like DHEA supplements or even testosterone patches to bump up your T just a little bit can really improve your quality of life, especially if you&#39;re having the symptoms of zero T (feeling sleepy all the damn time, low motivation, brain fog)

Given that OP was describing the negative side-effects of their GRS surgery, I&#39;d assume that they did have a sex drive before, which is a Different Problem™ than what you&#39;re describing

I had a sex drive before, but it was based more on envy rather than affection or lust. It was really unhealthy :/

Thank you for the advice. Do you know if we still produce testosterone after having SRS?

Your adrenal glands still produce some T, but in my experience, that production is
<em>
really
</em>
fragile - any kind of like, dieting or exercising too much will temporarily drop it to zero (this happens with hormones in cis people too, but they have way more of a buffer)

Thanks for that info. Was your surgery a successful one? Did you by any chance encounter any complications? Do you have any feelings of regret?

I had an orchi which has the same hormonal effects (and is way easier psychologically, I could care less about balls!)  I&#39;m planning on getting GRS sometime in the future but Life is getting in the way, I&#39;m moving to another country soon so I can&#39;t be out of commission for months atm, and once I get there I&#39;ll have to navigate their healthcare system

I had SRS almost two years ago and it really has taken a toll on my body both physically and mentally. I did encounter immediate urinary complications after SRS. And still currently dealing with it as we speak. If you do plan on getting SRS really do the research and ask the right questions. I went into it blind and not ask as much questions as I should of have. I also had wished that I had spoken to other women who had underwent the surgery. But at the time, there weren&#39;t a lot of videos of people sharing their post op surgical experience. And no one really talked about the complications that were involved with SRS. I honestly regret getting my bottom surgery because of my complication. We take things for granted in life. But I&#39;m human and make mistakes. I learn from it and now make the best out of it. Good luck girl with your move and life moving forward. Best wishes.

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had such a rough go of it, GRS more than other surgeries seems way more luck-of-the-draw than other ones, which definitely scares me

Listen to your heart and gut! SRS isn’t for everyone. For me, it was a natural decision. I knew I wanted and needed SRS.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, it has to be YOUR decision. YOUR choice. No one else.

Think of the big picture. Might take 6 months or one year to fully recover, but in the whole of your remaining life without genital dysphoria, it&#39;ll be worth it.

That said, it might be important to identify what&#39;s holding you before proceeding.

I understand. I knew I wanted the surgery since the beggining, and even though I had tons of genital dysphoria I still had to go through a good four or five months of therapy dedicated to process all risks involved and get to the conclusion I needed GRS regardless of the chance that things could not go as planned. Are you doing therapy or counseling?

A very very big decision it’s not like getting knee surgery or something like that.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure how old you are or if your age really matters, but I would just hold off for a bit especially considering post surgery depression would probably amplify the anxieties and thoughts you’re having now. You can always get the surgery but you can’t undo it.

Would you say the same thing to someone with cancer and them debating chemo therapy?

This took 15 seconds of googling

</p>
<p>
9% of breast cancer survivors surveyed regretted chemo, that&#39;s higher than SRS regret.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Women also regretted their adjuvant therapies. They regretted having chemotherapy because it caused premature menopause and side effects (e.g., “Yes, I would not have done the chemo. It made me worse and weakened my immune system. It caused thyroid infections. I can’t get rid of the achy bones” and “My cousin had the same thing. I would not have had radiation so I could radiate if I had a recurrence. I was not informed.”).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is without getting into ongoing discussions about cases where dying with cancer may be preferable to living with chemo.

Ah yes, making unfounded statements and then moving the goalposts when shown to be wrong. The hallmark of an intellectual heavyweight.

My surgeon wanted me off the bike a full year. I followed that mostly. I started testing the waters around 10 months. I would ride 5-10 minutes on a trainer once a week  and working up to 45 min aver a couple months. My surgeon was concerned about stressing the scar tissue. I would have been able to start 6 months if not for my wound separation. Since March I&#39;ve gotten out about 10 times and I&#39;m already getting closer to my presurgical average speed, but my endurance is still toast
