Hello,
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a post-op transwoman who underwent SRS a year and a half ago and experienced urinary complications after surgery. Has anyone else experienced urinary issues after their surgery?
</p>
<p>
Some of the symptoms I am encountering are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Hesitancy – a longer than usual wait for the stream of urine to begin,
</li>
<li>
Straining to urinate
</li>
<li>
Dribbling after urination has finished
</li>
<li>
Chronic urinary retention – not all the urine is passed from the bladder causing a need to urinate more often.
</li>
<li>
Frequency – a short time between needing to urinate,
</li>
<li>
Nocturia – a need to pass urine two or more times during the night.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I&#39;ve gone and seen a urologist specialist and have gotten tested for possibly a UTI or stricture and the test came out clear. I&#39;m just wondering if anyone else has similar symptoms and how did they manage to resolve this problem.
</p>

Have you had your prostate checked for swelling or positioning?
