My results from Dr Suporn! I had my main surgery in 2016 and then a cosmetic revision one year later. I can lubricate a lot once I reach orgasm.

How long was the recovery ? As it implies it‚Äôs much longer than other techniques and even 12 weeks off work not enough ? Is it true ?  How long do most have / need before return to work

It truly took around 1 year for me to feel back to normal. I went back to university 8 weeks after and it was very difficult with daily dilation and studying. If you try to do too much at once it always catches up with you later on. My best advice is to take as much time after the surgery to really take care of yourself and minimise stress, make sure to pamper yourself and learn meditation techniques too if you can. I burnt out down the line because I over did it. Always listen to your body - everyone is different. These days I follow the analogy of being like a wise oak tree - growing very slowly and therefore being very sturdy and stable. As opposed to the eucalyptus tree which grows very quickly and is very fragile / flammable. :P

Thank you so much for sharing your results, you have one of the best SRS results I have ever seen, he is on my short list for me SRS (well Dr. Bank), please consider posting photos of the angles that demonstrate more of the anatomy of the vulva (labia minora, clitoris, and clitoral hood), I have three questions: What elements of your vulva did you improve with your revision surgery? Did you ask to have any specific aesthetics for your vulva? Did you have circumcision before your SRS?

Thank you darling I will post better photos soon, these phots are flattering I guess. With the revision I had some asymmetrical parts of my labia minor fixed, anterior commissure was stitched together and looked fantastic for a year but seems to have opened a bit again and isn&#39;t as neat as it was. I also had some excess urethral tissue removed. I had my clitoris neatened too. I did not ask for anything specific on the initial surgery, just the above requests for the revision. I was not circumcised. I have seen some even better results in person where girls have had a second revision with Dr Suporn, they can really perfect it even more!

I&#39;ve heard that Suporn&#39;s technique requires a different method of dilation. If you&#39;re willing to share, what is your dilation routine like and have you had any difficulties with it?

Yes we do dynamic dilation. I have never had difficulties, although for the first year it was hard for me to move a lot, walking would make dilation harder as well as having a full bowel also made it take longer. It was generally just very difficult if I missed a dilation session. I can&#39;t compare to other techniques as I only know girls who wen&#39;t to Thailand. I have seen some two lovely results from Dr Chet and one result from Dr Kamol. Now i&#39;m 6 years post opp and only dilate before sex, although if I have regular sex I don&#39;t need to dilate as it can become very loose lol.

It means using the dilator in circular motions instead of static dilation which just leaves it still / straight on in the vagina.

One question, how much did you spend for the surgery and how much for the revision? I am considering Suporn, his results look fantastic but may be out of my budget :(

Around 6 years ago the first revision and even second revision are included in the main surgery price which was ¬£13,000, so the revisions are optional and do not cost more except  you pay for the flights and hotel etc. My guess is that the cost has increased and i&#39;m not sure of what the current revision policy is.
