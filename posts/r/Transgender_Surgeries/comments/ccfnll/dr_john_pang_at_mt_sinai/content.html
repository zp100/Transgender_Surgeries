So I&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s time for me to take the next step in my transition, and I&#39;ve started to pursue bottom surgery. I had a conultation with Dr Bluebond Langner, but didn&#39;t have a particularly good experience so I decided to look at Dr Ting.
</p>
<p>
Dr Ting is currently scheduling out almost a year for consultations, but on the phone the Mt Sinai rep mentioned that there are two other docs there that perform the procedure: Dr John Pang and Dr Bella Avanessian.
</p>
<p>
I looked around online but couldn&#39;t really find anything about either of them. The rep mentioned that Dr Pang is new, at least to Mt Sinai.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really tempted to take the plunge and see Dr Tang. What do you all think? Does anyone know anything about him?
</p>

. Idk if there are rules about duplicating a post?)

I don’t know much about Dr. Pang, but I highly recommend Avanessian. I am having surgery with her in 3ish weeks. I had a friend who went to her and her work is amazing.

I consulted in mid March, and was able to schedule either end of July, early August. I decided early August. She had a super welcoming and knowledgeable personality. My mom was VERY nervous and cautious and she set all of my moms nerves and questions at ease. However, I really don’t think you could go wrong with anyone at Mt. Sinai.

May I ask what made your experience with Dr. Bluebond-Langner less than ideal?

The were a couple of things. The big one is how dismissive she was. I had been given no instructions on how to prepare, which was due, by her own admission, to them not having a dedicated social worker, and when I showed up she acted like I was an idiot/wasting her time for not having done anything. On top of that in the consult they basically immediately threw out the psych letters I had sent them. I had waited 9 months for a consult, and at no point had they indicated that the letters weren&#39;t sufficient. It boils down to there being no communication from their office, and then I was taken to task for not doing things that I hadn&#39;t been told to do. It was a massive waste of time and funds on my end.

Just checking in to see if you’d been able to dig up any info on his results, I just got called for the waiting list and set a consult for him later this month, with the opportunity for surgery in November. I had originally been interested in going with Dr Avanessian but she isn’t booking until March right now...

Nope. Haven&#39;t learned anything new. Please if you can post about your experience at the consultation when it happens!

I had my consultation with John Pang a week or so ago, and I really liked him. He was very nice, confident, communicative, and comforting. I don&#39;t solely go with my gut when it comes to doctors, but I did get the sense that he knew what he was doing and really wanted me to feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
He also took the time to clear out things in my chart that were illogical or irrelevant, which he didn&#39;t have to do. He also apologized for turning away from me when he did.
</p>
<p>
Don&#39;t know much more about him than that he trained with Ting, which was enough for me. Figure Ting wouldn&#39;t let someone do this on their own without being really good at it.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s hoping. My turn in January.
