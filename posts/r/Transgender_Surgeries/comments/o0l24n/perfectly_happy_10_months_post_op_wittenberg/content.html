This is an apology for freaking the fuck out the first three months.  So let it be known, everyone heals differently.  There&#39;s really no point in judging things until you&#39;re close to a year post op.
</p>
<p>
Wittenberg and staff are amazing and are god tier for srs.
</p>
<p>
Am I going to post pics? No.  I&#39;m stealth, have stealth sex, I&#39;m not posting anything more than words.
</p>
<p>
Am I getting a revision? Yes.  I can have some loose skin removed, get a commissure, and definitely need more hood and less clit functionally.
</p>
<p>
What do I like? I have very tiny folds that make cis identical labia minora.  I have a rather fat labia majora so it hides the scars.  I get very wet naturally (PI).  I can orgasm vaginally and clitorally.  I&#39;ve been told I taste good.  I have a very deep vagina (last dot on orange).
</p>
<p>
But yeah, I wanted to update the sub bc 9 months ago it was curses and hellfire coming out.  I blame the drugs.

From what I remember, you ended up going through recovery alone, and not by choice or plan.  And that&#39;s very rough.  I&#39;m glad it worked out in the end.  And I hope you were able to vent a bit on here in the tougher times.

Thanks for the update. It&#39;s good to her about the other side of an emotionally difficult recovery.
