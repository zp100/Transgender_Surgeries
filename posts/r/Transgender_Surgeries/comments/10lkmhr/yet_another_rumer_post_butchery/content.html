Yeah. I don&#39;t wanna get too far into this one. Vaginoplasty Surgery was around 7 years ago now and honestly most of that time my life kind of took a dive off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
And now that it&#39;s not off a cliff anymore, I have to reconcile with the fact that I don&#39;t really have a vagina. I have *whatever this is*.
</p>
<p>
I can provide pictures later, but it&#39;s all the usual stuff I feel. The urethral opening is strange and swollen. The vaginal opening doesn&#39;t really sit inside the rest of it? It almost looks like the urethral opening is supposed to be vaginal opening, just based on position and appearance, really fucking weird, I get bacterial infections constantly, and even 7 years later it just is clearly not right.
</p>
<p>
At the time I got this surgery, there wasn&#39;t really the same info readily available. That was even before this sub was created. I was a desperate teen, my mother and I were both kind of desperate to get it done and the original surgeon we wanted to go with had a mixup in their records and actually did not even have letters on file for me when they said they did and it was this whole deal. It&#39;s not important my point is I don&#39;t really wanna be victim blamed or told I should know better. I was a traumatized 19 year old with multiple attempts.
</p>
<p>
So yeah. What exactly are my options? The fuck can I actually do? Am I kinda just doomed?

I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re doomed. I&#39;m certain there are things that could at least be done, and who you can go to depends on where you live and what type of insurance or financial resources you have. Bluebond Langner works out of NY and she&#39;s one of the best. I considered her for phallo but she does do vaginosplasty too. If she lived closer to me I would&#39;ve went with her rather than Gupta. (I live in Michigan) *eta for the Bacterial infections in the meantime you can take boric acid I&#39;m sure

BBL is one of the best GRS surgeons, so if you can get in with her, you would do well.

I really don&#39;t know if I can get in with someone in NY when I&#39;m in Michigan, relying on MI medicaid.

I have Merdian and Medicare. I am in Network with Gupta. Kuzon is also a butcher. Do NOT let him touch you. I would&#39;ve went to Kuzon otherwise. See if you are in Network with Blue Bond before letting Kuzon touch you, PLEASE. Eta: Gupta is in Ohio so Blue Bond very well could be in Network

Yeah doesnt look like she&#39;s in network. In fact her website says she doesnt even accept medicaid or it isnt listed.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s... cool. Didnt know that Ive heard fairly positive things for him in the area.
</p>
<p>
Im not sure I can really travel to see anyone to be honest. Maybe Ill just be happy with my alien puss...
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s entirely possible I just dont know enough abt vaginas to say how it looks. No partner Ive ever had has said it looked strange /shrug. But then again why would you ever tell anyone that even when they ask you.
</p>
<p>
Not to be too triggering but the thought of there basically being 0 help and support has my ideation at an all time high.

But then again, that&#39;s cis vulvas, and who needs to follow stereotypes.  It also doesn&#39;t cover internals like urethra shape/placement.

Gupta also does Vaginosplasty and is in Network. It&#39;s like $70+ for a bus ticket to Ohio where he is. I wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it otherwise. I strongly urge you to seek him out instead of Kuzon. I was warned by several phallo patients not to go to Kuzon.

That&#39;s fair. I can look at Gupta but then it becomes and issue of like, will they be willing to do revisions?

There’s a lot of sub standard surgery being done in the USA these days so I think there’s every chance some surgeons will become skilled in fixing things up and well known for it.
</p>
<p>
Right now it’s very difficult to know what do do for revisions, apart from avoiding them in the first place.

I’m so sorry that happened to you. It would be worth it to search around and see who does revision surgeries, or even speak with your PCP about options. Reach out to your local trans community for potential surgeons. If you’re PA local, I can at least give some names and contact info for surgeons, but again you’d have to inquire as to if it’s possible for them to do revisions.
</p>
<p>
For now, seeking therapy to at least process some of the feelings around this might be helpful, or else a trans support group. But I don’t think you should give up and write yourself off just yet. Explore options, even if that means you have to travel a bit. What was supposed to be freeing for you turned into a nightmare, and you deserve to be cared for properly.

Hi.  You don&#39;t have a post history to guide a compassionate reply but it is clear you&#39;re in hopelessness mode in a way that internet strangers can only do so much.  I agree with the post above, and wish you the best.  In addition to the other surgeons recommended here I recall Dr de Corral (Baltimore MD) has been the subject of several posts w/fine aesthetics and may do revision.

Personally just wish I had known there were maybe 5 good surgeons in the world and 75% of that is thailand and prohibitive af ao I couldve just jumped off a parking structure instead of going thru any of this.
