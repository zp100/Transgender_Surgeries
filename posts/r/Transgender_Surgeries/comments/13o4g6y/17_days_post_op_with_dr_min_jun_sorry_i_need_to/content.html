17 days post op with Dr Min Jun, sorry I need to shave, but otherwise extremely happy with everything and how great healing has been going. I have my last post op on Tuesday, and then I get to finally head back home to Oregon after being away for a whole month. ☺️

Looks great. Congratulations. My surgery is 31 days away. Can I ask you how was the sitting for your flight home. I’m having surgery 9 hours away from my house in Dallas and will have to ride back in a car a week after and I’m concerned about having to sit that long.

Thank you. I’m actually not flying. I’m driving back to Portland Oregon. Which is about a 8-9 hour drive. I’ve been able to sit in a car for more than an hour with my donut pillow and have no issues. I recently went to the theater and watched a 2 1/2 hour movie with no issues and didn’t have my donut pillow. Sitting down hasn’t been an issue for me. I will see how this drive home is on Tuesday. I’ll be making frequent stops to walk and dilate.

Thank you for your reply, I shouldn’t have assumed you were flying home. I’m having zero depth vaginoplasty so I’m hoping I’ll be able to sit a few hours at a time with breaks to walk around.

I’m not sure how it will be with zero depth. Also everyone’s healing process is different. Just trust your body, can also take some pain meds to help ease your mind if you’re worried about any pain/discomfort. My healing has been going alot better than I was expecting going into the surgery. Just be patient, the first week after getting discharged from the hospital was the worst, not in terms of pain, just the mobility part of it, the catheter being in and just trying to walk and be comfortable. Make sure you Ice the area and sleep with a pillow between your legs if being on your back begins to be uncomfortable, it gets easier everyday.

It really helps looking into the surgeon, and other patients of that surgeon. I’m sure there are plenty of people who have had the same thoughts before jumping into it. Once you start doing hair removal and getting those letters and consults you’ll hardly have time to focus on it actually happening until the night before like it hit me. I was a big cry baby in the hospital before surgery and they gave me anxiety medication to help and then I was waking up and in my hospital room. It goes by so quickly and if you’re really wanting a vagina then you’ll be so happy, just choose the right surgeon for it.

I’m very confident and happy with the surgeon I’ve chosen. Dr. Dany Hanna in Texas. I’ve spoken with several of his patients and seen pictures of their results. That part is the least of what’s worrying me. Just the idea of surgery and recovery is hard to imagine. I’m sure I’ll have no idea of the pain till I experience it for myself. I’ve always been able to handle whatever pain I’ve been in but this has to be on another level.

The pain just depends on the person. Everyone has different pain tolerance, if you’re in any pain the nurses are there to help give pain medication. I wasn’t in any pain. My surgeon puts anesthetic in the area after surgery so it’s pretty much numb for that whole first day. I’m not sure how other surgeons are. Does Dr Dany Hanna perform PPT is that the method you’re getting?

Yes he does but I’m getting zero depth with no vaginal canal. He does a few different types of vaginoplasty. All of the patients I’ve spoken with have nothing but praise for him and his staff and the pictures I’ve seen are amazing so I’m completely comfortable with him. I’ve had two zoom meetings with him and he’s a really nice man and cares so much for his patients.

That’s good, as long as you feel comfortable and safe with the surgeon then that’s all that matters and if he has other patients who are happy as well then you’ll be in good hands. I was going back and forth with zero depth or full depth. I ultimately decided for full because I wanted the whole experience and not feel limited sexually for myself

He honestly is the best surgeon on the west coast. His stitch work and aesthetics are what sold me on him, he’s been great from consult to post op. I literally have no complaints.
</p>
<p>
Oh my ☺️🤞🏼 well thank you. I’m extremely happy and hope once I’m fully healed she’s hard to tell apart from cis-surgery.

Thank you. I got PPT. My insurance paid for everything. I just checked my online account with my insurance and my surgeon and the hospital billed $106,245 total. It was like 50,000 went to my surgeon and then another 50,000 went to the hospital and then the anesthesiologist fees combined came to that total amount.

I don’t have any stitches on my abdomen. They’re small incisions that have an adhesive glue over them, and the glue will peel off overtime. I didn’t really have much pain or gas pain, it was mostly just a bit of discomfort at times but it was all manageable. The only part I hated was the hospital bed and having to be careful with the catheter. Aside from that everything wasn’t that bad, it was definitely easier than I was expecting going into it.

What led to you deciding to drive back home rather than to fly back? Also, where have you been staying since discharged from the hospital? Has it been very important for you to have someone with you to help during this whole time? Congrats!

Thank you, and being away from home for a month my partner and I wanted to have our own car to get around instead of spending money on Uber/Lyfts and we both had a lot of belongings to bring along with our cat. My partner has been helping me through everything.

We stayed at an Airbnb. I was in the hospital for 3 nights 4 days and the day I was discharged we checked into our Airbnb.

Thanks for the answers. There&#39;s a high likelihood I&#39;ll be in a similar situation in a couple of years, so this is helpful. Enjoy!
