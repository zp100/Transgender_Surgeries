I have  consultation with him next week because my care coordinator gave me what Kaiser has for FFS and I have almost no information on him going in.

I also have Kaiser, and was given the choice of Michael Nuara as well as the doctors at the Meltzer clinic. I opted to go with Dr Ley for my consult, as she reportedly has a great deal of experience with facial/cranial reconstruction even prior to her time with trans health.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I opted to start consults with Dr Ley (also covered by Kaiser) because there was no information on Dr Nuara.
</p>
<p>
However, I will say there&#39;s no harm on going to a consult with him. The downside to the path I&#39;ve chosen is that consults are like 4 months away with Dr Ley. You&#39;ve got yours very soon. Worth staying the course for a little intel. And afterwards, if you have doubts, concerns, or anything, you should have other decent options available to you.
</p>
<p>
*edit, sorry this doesn&#39;t directly answer your question. I thought perhaps hearing that you&#39;re not alone in finding zero info on him, and that was very much a deciding factor for me.

Yeah I&#39;ve had my consult scheduled for a bit now, I got him because I said I wouldn&#39;t go near meltzer clinic with a 40 ft pole. Lol. I&#39;ve pretty much prematurely decided on keojampa and plan to switch to premera in March, but I&#39;ll get everything I can from consults in the meantime!

I&#39;ve been doing my own research too. And while Dr Meltzer makes me nervous to say the least, was there something that scared you from the place?

Yeah. Dr meltzer lol.  Also Dr ley looks like her face is a different color than the rest of her like a face graft that didn&#39;t heal underneath, which makes me feel like I&#39;ll end up with the same thing, even though I know that one is unfounded, it still scares me off.

Well I certainly get the hesitation with Dr Melzer.
</p>
<p>
And with regards to Dr Leys&#39; face, it could just be mismanaged make up, bad sunning practices in Arizona, etc. The thing about talented surgeons in any speciality is that they can&#39;t do it on themselves. They gotta trust another surgeon. That&#39;s the one I&#39;d avoid. So while I get what you&#39;re saying, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ll see the same results on her work.

Yeah. I feel the same that it&#39;s mostly just a make up thing. It&#39;s mainly that she works out of the meltzer clinic and I&#39;ve heard about a kind of a big decline in Dr meltzers quality particularly in the last couple of years. And there certainly are better ffs surgeons it&#39;s not something g I plan on going substandard with. My top 3 are keojampa, deschamps braly and toby mayer. I wish I could do toby mayer with brow work but alas, that doesent happen so that would be a 2 pert surgery that way.

I unfortunately have to stick within my insurance if I want affordable FFS. And that&#39;s Dr&#39;s Nuara and Ley. Meltzer isn&#39;t even in the running.
</p>
<p>
I asked someone that had posted that they had FFS with Meltzer and she flat out did not recommend him at all. The glaring absence of current work as well as statements from folks that have had his care just turned me off. I&#39;ll know after my consult coming up if Dr Ley has any red flags.
</p>
<p>
We could compare notes, even. :)

Great idea. We will compare. Ffs will last a lifetime so I&#39;ll wait it out to open enrollment to go after what I&#39;m comfortable with. It just sucks kaiser is the only provider that covers face electro. Big sheesh.

I don&#39;t, nor do I assume he did. I&#39;m just spooked by meltzer clinic on a whole. Though Dr ley specifically I&#39;ve heard alright things about.
