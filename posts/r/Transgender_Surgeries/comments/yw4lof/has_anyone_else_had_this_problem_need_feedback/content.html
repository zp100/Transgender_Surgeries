No pictures at this time, perhaps later. For now, a description and questions. Had zero depth with Dr Chris Mcclung in Columbus one month ago now. Generally back to daily routine , though still some fatigue.  As early as one week I told the doctor my genitals felt like if someone was pressing their palm firmly against your nose and chrushing it, pushing it sideways or something. Now without pain, this discomfort is quite distracting. I am certain that the penile stump is constantly pushing too far out against what should be the mons pubis just above where the labia meet. This also presses the neoclitoris against the clitoral hood CONSTANTLY. This is bad enough but ive begun to feel some arousal and its all much worse then. The stump &#39;erects&#39; into the left hand upper labia and distends it. If this continues I will never want anyone to see this. I know I&#39;m only one month out but I dont see how the  penile stump will get any shorter? Has any one experienced similar and what was the outcome/ fix? Problematically I have a surgery already scheduled for late december and I might lose insurance in early march so tick tock, need to beat the clock. Advice?

EDIT: only looking to hear if you had the SAME issue and what the outcome was. I am aware that patience is a virtue, etc.

In general, one month is way too soon to even think about revisions. Also, that sensation is not unheard of and generally will subside. That swelling is more concerning and may well indicate retained erectile tissue. That would be a somewhat common complication because they do try and save as much erogenous issue as possible although it’s a fine balancing act. This does not mean anything was “botched,” a term that gets tossed around way, way too often and which really only should apply to situations where the surgeon made an actual mistake (ie was grossly negligent, failed to identity structures, lacked proper training to even do the procedure, etc.) leading to an unforeseen injury. Fortunately excess erectile tissue can be removed, but unfortunately if your insurance is running out you are on a tight ship. Your best bet is to talk to your doctor immediately and see what can be done and if it’s even possible in such a narrow window. Good luck.

I haven&#39;t had this issue but had my GCS with McClung. Have you reached out to him again to let him know how discomforting this is?  He needs to know this - I know he&#39;s done emergency revisions for people before when things were giving problems - all I can really say is get in touch with him and make sure he knows this is a problem for you and you need it rectified.

Ok great!

I wanted to add too that 2 months after having my canal added by him, I was on a jet and went to use the bathroom...ibstarted bleeding quite a bit. Got super worried - not sure if the pressure caused it or would have happened anyways. Anyhow I texted him when the plane landed and he got me into the office the very next day that I was home ( which was three or four days later )  fortunately it was just granulation tissue treated with silver nitrate, but he was prompt about it.

Make sure you state how much discomfort this is giving you, both physically and emotionally. He is very compassionate and I&#39;m sure he will help get you taken care of.
