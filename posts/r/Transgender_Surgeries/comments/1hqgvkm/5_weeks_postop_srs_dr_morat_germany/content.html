Wow, you&#39;ve been through a lot.  You are still way too swollen to see how it&#39;ll all work out. Hopefully the swelling goes down, the labia is very plump, it takes months possibly up to a year for all the swelling to subsided. Best of luck, keep us updated on your progress, even if only in text, I myself am a bit shy to share pics. ðŸ«‚

I also had my operation done by morath and schÃ¶ll. I didn&#39;t have that much of complications (no direct revision surgery) but also a bladder infection. Mine also looked reeaaly swollen and I was also surprised by my bad healing (huge swelling etc.) since I also live quite healthy. So I justed wanted to say, the worst part is over for you &lt;3 when they let you out of the hospital you are definitely going to get better soon. I know it&#39;s hard to give yourself the time needed, but your body will recover faster than you think (you can look at my profile I have a bit of a timeline).  If you have any further questions just ask, I wish you all the best! You have come so far and nobody can take that from you anymore &lt;3

Very honest I have done extensive research on the results of Vaginalplasty performed in Germany and I must say I&#39;m not impressed. I live in Germany myself but after having done several consultations with different surgeons I am sure that I would never do it in Germany. Lots of love and I hope you get well really fast

thank you very much!  May I ask where you would do it?
</p>
<p>
For me  it wasnâ€™t possible to pay the whole price on my own, so I had to do it in Germany because health insurance takes most of the costs
