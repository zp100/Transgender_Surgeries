Hello,
</p>
<p>
As a bit of background : I am a stealth girl, started my journey in 2001.
</p>
<p>
As  of today I am in Korea for VFSRAC with Dr Kim at Yeson. Even if I am  pretty sure everything will be fine and that it&#39;s going to be a bliss  there is only one difference between surgery here  and elsewhere in asia  :- The social aspect isn&#39;t that much thought after,
</p>
<p>
- We often travel alone and the surgery itself makes us mute for a while.
</p>
<p>
Here  is my idea : a monthly topic here where girls can announce where  they&#39;re going to stay and what they are up to IRL so they can meet  together, make their stay nicer and help eachother !
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s go :
</p>
<p>
-  Ninja Girl (me !) : Here whole Dec. 2021, STAY at Riviera Hotel -  VFSRAC during mid of the month. Available for lunch and coffee at the  hotel, eat outs and drinks out, touring too. ALSO available as an  helping hand in case you want something from the mall and you&#39;re too  tired to grab it. Feel free to answer here or message me.
</p>
<p>
Notice  : I am not endorsed by Yeson in any way. This topic is for the sole  prospect of helping each others. ALWAYS respect aftercare principles :  Use keyboard or text-to-speach once you&#39;ve got VFSRAC. Please do not  consider this topic as a dating place.
</p>
<p>
If  that&#39;s getting traction it may be cool to create a new topic like this  one each month. I may keep doing it if everyone is happy with it.  :)
</p>

I got my surgery in the middle of last month. The team was wonderful.
</p>
<p>
But I don&#39;t think you&#39;re gonna be able to find anyone to take you up on your offer. They&#39;re not getting as many international patients due to the quarantine (it seems).
</p>
<p>
Most people get out of quarantine and go for their analysis immediately. I wish I could have hung out with you though.
</p>
<p>
6 days till I can speak!

Congratulations on doing it :) Quarantine was no joke and I really was happy it was at a good hotel : I kept my sanity but I won&#39;t forget it anytime soon !

<p>
Good so far. It only hurt for a day or two after surgery. Most of the pain was gone after one day.
</p>
<p>
I got a laryngoscopy done locally yesterday and it looks to be healing well. So I&#39;ll be trying to talk this Friday!
</p>
<p>
How about you? You get your turn yet? :P

Me too. The meals were samey (I opted vegetarian too) but they were varied enough to get me out of bed 3x a day.

I powered through the quarantine. It was only 10 days and they take care of everything.
</p>
<p>
The airport takes you to your facility and they bring you decent food 3x a day. It was honestly way better than what I do at home.
</p>
<p>
The facility are just regular hotels too. They&#39;re just being used for covid quarantine.
</p>
<p>
It does add like a grand onto your costs and you&#39;re stuck there 10 more days than usual. But I had no trouble working/gaming with their internet.

I was at Grand Hyatt Incheon (now at Riviera Hotel for my normal 3 week stay) during my quarantine and the hotel is top notch, even better than Riviera... BTW, I cannot recommend this hotel, it is too expensive and outdated.
</p>
<p>
Quarantine went fine and the food was OK. It looks like food is usually ok to &#34;good&#34; depending on where your quarantine is. I chose Korean meals at first but dishes happens to be the same ones, rotating. They were all good but I got a bit bored so I switched to Western dishes for 2 days and that was a bad choice : Bland gulash of unknown everything :D I went back to korean tasty stuff ASAP !

Daaaamn, you got lucky! I was at a random hotel in the middle of nowhere. I can&#39;t even remember the name now...
</p>
<p>
Even then - it wasn&#39;t bad. The showers were clean and the beds were good enough.

Somewhere around 6500 Euros until 2022 as they&#39;ve  just built their very own clinic and there will be a slight price increase.

Is the clinic they built the one we went to? Or is it a new one they just built for next year?

If it is a very white building with the clinic and labs on multiple floors : Yes it&#39;s the new &#34;Yeson Only&#34; Clinic.
</p>
<p>
Previous Yeson place was a single floor in a multiple offices business building.

Ahhh, I wish I remembered to scout this subreddit! I landed in Seoul Dec 4, quarantined until the 14th, had my consult and operation on the 21st/22nd, and I flew home on New Years Day!
</p>
<p>
It was definitely a bit of a struggle not knowing any Korean besides &#34;hello&#34; and &#34;thank you&#34;.

Sounds like you booked your trip as if there was 14 days quarantine too haha :D
</p>
<p>
I did too, then quarantine was reduced to 10 days. I didn&#39;t shorten my trip and I loved that decision because I was able to actually enjoy Seoul ! Having time before and after the surgery and actually visiting places and hanging out kept my mind out of &#34;surgery and recovery mode&#34; and I feel that this was a good decision for mind&#39;s health and recovery too.
</p>
<p>
Quarantine was easy for you ?

Yeah, exactly, haha, I&#39;d planned for 14 days quarantine, and didn&#39;t want to mess too much with the airline ticket. It was easier to ask my Airbnb host to add 4 days, and then just explore Seoul a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Quarantine was an absolute nightmare, but not for standard reasons. I was at the Splaisir, and the room was great. The food was... cold room-temp. No way to heat up the food. My issue was... I was working remotely based on PST in order to coordinate with colleagues, so I was waking up around 2:30 am, working from 3am to noon, then sleeping between lunch and dinner, and again after dinner to 2:30 am. I was jetlagged hard, and working strange hours, and that killed my appetite and energy levels.
</p>
<p>
Everything improved the moment I left quarantine. I checked out street food several days, shopped for replacement luggage and skincare, took Christmas photos, visited a sex shop twice (I was too shy the first time), experienced snow on a rooftop... It was a wonderful time.
</p>
<p>
My Airbnb was next to a CU convenience store. I&#39;m perpetually dehydrated, but the easy access Pocari Sweat kept me better hydrated than I&#39;ve ever been my whole life.
</p>
<p>
I also met a cute girl who spoke some Korean, and we went on a food-date once. Still keep in touch, and I&#39;m hoping to meet up again someday.

I am here now in quarantine day 6 out of 7. I got the MarinaBay Hotel. I&#39;m not a fan of the cold food. Been eating top ramen, white rice and mandarin oranges all week. Staying the Conrad Seoul hotel after. I also booked when it was a 10 day quarantine and then it dropped to 7 days, but I left my reservation the same because it was more expensive to change the plane tickets so I&#39;ll have an extra 3 days in the hotel. I&#39;m also working remotely while I&#39;m here. Sleeping 3pm to 11pm and getting up to work until 10am in the morning to stay on US time. Surgery is next Wednesday.
