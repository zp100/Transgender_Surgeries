Parts of the website have quite the AI generated vibe:

Putting the type 3 v type 1 debate aside, I personally have had a CT scan and found I lack a frontal sinus cavity, which means a type 1 would be fine with me, when I asked them on the phone the other day as pre surgical checks I asked them about imaging techniques and how they approach it technique wise. They led me to believe type 1 from the person booking but I will be sure to ask for further details at the time of appointment.

I have a consultation with them in a few days, I will let you know what I thought.
</p>
<p>
They took my photos and asked to see me in person, asked what my goals are and I showed them (I have a reference model for what I’m looking to achieve) and they have told me they can get a quote for me and even listed similar procedures to what I’ve been recommended elsewhere, however they also mentioned they don’t generally do facial implants like some surgeons.
</p>
<p>
I’ll pass over what I can from that talk

So here is my update on this post consultation.
</p>
<p>
It’s not just dr vlachos who does ffs. The consultant I saw who would be doing my surgery is dr Sheehan jabir. He told me he hasn’t done ffs for very long but has done most of the component like brow reduction, hairline lowering, rhinoplasty, chin and jaw surgery, can do deep neck surgery and tracheal shaves.
</p>
<p>
We had a good talk about it for about 45 minutes based on my goals (I’ve been researching this shit for like a decade as I had a really slow time on the nhs getting care and knew it was what I wanted). I’d prepared images of a reference im looking to aim toward and thinks what I want from my nose, hairline, brow etc is all achievable.
</p>
<p>
As far as prices, that will be sent to me early next week, and photos of what they think can be done a la facial teams processes will be sent to me too.
</p>
<p>
It seemed similar to conversations I’ve had with other ffs surgeons so I feel slightly ambivalent? I had very similar recommendations from facial team and Toby Mayer (though mayer wouldn’t touch my jaw and has a different approach to hairline work than this surgeon).
