Dr jumaily does very neat suture work that scars very nicely. Even his hairline incisions are made directly behind the hairline to remain hidden. If you donâ€™t need to a hairline lowering than I would definitely opt for a coronal incision, as that would be one less scar to worry about. I would ask him about forehead height increasing with the coronal incision, as there is a lot of different opinions on whether that is true or not. A high rounded forehead is more feminine than a low angular forehead though, so keep that in mind. Also people rarely mention how a brow lift can decrease the length of your forehead too. Best!!

Hairline you&#39;ll probably have visible scarring right at the hairline, with coronal it&#39;ll be buried back in the hair, but you might end up with hairloss in that area as well.

That is definitely a common question and an important factor to consider when going through facial feminization. This blog post was written to address some of the common questions that come up when comparing the two types of incisions. Please let me know if you think any more information about the topic would be helpful for you. Best wishes with your upcoming surgery!

I was told some years ago that hydrogen peroxide can damage self-dissolving sutures. Has the material been changed, or do you only use non-dissolving ones?

That is absolutely correct. Thank you for pointing that out. Hydrogen peroxide can prematurely break down absorbable sutures. This has even been shown in studies (
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17638764/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17638764/</a>
). If absorbable sutures are used, then hydrogen peroxide should not be used to clean the site. Many surgeons use staples behind the hairline and removable sutures for their hairline incision. If the surgeon uses absorbable sutures (chromic, plain gut, fast gut) for their surface closure , then it&#39;s best to avoid hydrogen peroxide. I&#39;ll clarify that in the post. Thank you for the question!

Well i did read somewhere out there. In which you can Google that a coronal incision would be best if done in a zig zag method.
</p>
<p>
I just got this exact procedure done and the doctor never asked me nor did I know I could have asked in which upsets me now since I&#39;m worried about hairstyles now. They just think that since i have long thick hair i shouldn&#39;t worry but he&#39;ll yeah i worry.
</p>
<p>
Surely I can say that whatever I was reading did state that zig zag could help incisions become more undetectable.
</p>
<p>
Now I&#39;d like to say if u do u should wear sun protective hats and or face shield for the other surgeries if u decide to get them. Don&#39;t want to let that &#34;potential&#34; scar get worse.
</p>
<p>
Other than that hairline scarring just make sure to take necessary supplements such as a high percentage of collagen to help ur skin heal best and pumpkin juice for swelling i prefer hand squeezing it&#39;s less expensive and pineapple juice. And any juices from r.w. Knudsen, as well as electrolyte packets and alkaline water to heal best and potentially more quickly. And get scar w/ added SPF if u are going outside or near windows that have sun rays that let themselves in. But either than that regular scar gel application just ask ur doctor when you can start.
</p>
<p>
Currently I&#39;m still healing and my scalp is numb and incision area hasn&#39;t healed yet so still has more to go. Sleeping has been hard. Nights have been annoying but a muscle relaxer and or acetaminophen pm can help relax u and put u to bed. Make sure ur hair is in a hospital bonnet nothing too constricting it will only annoy u so make sure to ask for tons to take home if u can as well as a few ice packs.
</p>
<p>
Not sure if i can say this but I asked my PCP for celebrex and it help swelling and pain. Worked as the best cocktail with the oxi/oxi- acetaminophen that&#39;s usually prescribed...later on ibuprofen and acetaminophen works best alongside celebrex if u need it and switch to Tylenol pm when u go to bed. That is all i know that i felt that worked for me. If not I would have felt very uncomfortable. After a week u might feel better and after a week an a half much better or so.
</p>
<p>
Good luck.
