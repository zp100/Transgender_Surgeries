Yes this is normal in some people. I had it too and it all came back after a couple of months. It’s a reaction. Don’t stress too much, be gentle with the hair.

Oh thats so relieving to hear someone had this too and that it came back! Did you have FFS too if I may ask? Did you take any pills in order to recover from hair loss or did it just regrow by itself? Thanks!!

It’s called shock hair loss and you typically recover from it after 3 months. It can take a little longer as the regrowth is gradual. Your T-blockers already do help with the regrowth and with the mitigation of hair loss, but if you’d like you can talk to your doctor about a pill called Finasteride. You can also massage the scalp everyday in order to stimulate blood flow which helps.  Here’s some basic info about it

I’d follow up with your surgeon first rather than ask randoms on Reddit.

Im taking biotin for like 2 weeks now but hair is still falling out sm 😔 oh and it sometimes is itchy and it kinda „hurts“ on the bald spot areas. Well not like hurt hurting but is kinda sensitive and feels like a headache or something. did anyone else experience this and if so how long did it take for the hair to grow back?

Huge hugs I imagine that is frustrating, but as others have said it should be stress induced and grow back but may take a while!  Hidden&#39;s link is spot on to what your issue appears
</p>
<pre>
<code>
Telogen effluvium:
</code>

<p>
The body’s response to physical, chemical, and /or emotional distressors, typically caused by things like high stress, child birth, and surgeries. The good news is that TE is not caused by DHT, and thus your loss isn’t permanent

Thank you! Hugs. I hope its TE, I was thinking if it might be alopecia areata. A few years ago, I think 2018 when I wasnt feeling good I had one bald spot which was pretty small compared to what I have now, I think it was due to stress. Hope it grows back soon.

Ahhh that&#39;s another reasonable guess.  TE is probably more likely given you explicitly had surgery.  But alopecia areata wouldn&#39;t be unreasonable either.  Quite a few trans folks have posted hair loss like this after surgery so its fairly normal.  Super annoying clearly!

Like others said I may be shock hair loss. My dr. Had me apply Rogain to the hairs around the scar for a few months. Now there’s no proof that it helps, but he does it anyways because it seems to help. After discussing with your dr. You could also try that. There’s no real negative it’s just a lil pricey.

Do you have rosacea or eczema? I read that surgery can cause flare ups which make shock loss even more dramatic. It will grown back, I’m sorry that sucks!
