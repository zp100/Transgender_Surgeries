Hello! first of all sorry for the grammatical mistakes, I have translated this in a translator. In Spain the Social Security -which is the public sanitary system- covers this operation but the waiting list is too long. So I decided to have surgery in November 2020 in a private clinic.  After this -in December- I discovered that I had a fistula and my doctor put me in the hands of another doctor, who is a colleague of him, and works with the social security -public  sanitary system- I was in shock and wanted to get it fixed as soon as possible and did not see the problem of this -I paid private and now they where taking me to public- what happens is that with the covid and others the waiting in the Social Security are very long. Plus, this year I have had 2 interventions to solve the fistula, and none has worked. I&#39;m constantly insisting at the clinic but they are giving me excuses: to be patient, etc. I personally think is their responsibility as I have paid for the surgery and must not be waiting this long and using the public sanitary system. These months have been devastating, I am in a major depression and I don&#39;t want this to happen to anyone else. PLEASE people who have surgery in Spain, ask your clinic if you have surgery: whatâ€™s the procedure and process in case there are any complications. Don&#39;t let it happen to you like it did to me and leave it in the hands of the Social Security from the beginning.

Would you mind naming the surgeons.

Hi
</p>
<p>
I am sorry to hear you are going through a tough time. I hope you can find resolution soon.
</p>
<p>
I have had surgery with Dr. Fakin and I feel I have to give my experience.
</p>
<p>
My experience has been very positive. My care and aftercare has been really amazing. From the time I came to Madrid, during my stay in hospital including afterwards while I remained in Madrid and also the time since my surgery, I have had great support from Dr. Fakin and his team, and continue to do so.
</p>
<p>
From my experience I  recommend Dr. Fakin and his clinic highly .
</p>
