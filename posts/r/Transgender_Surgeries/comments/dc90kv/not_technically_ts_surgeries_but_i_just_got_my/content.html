Not Technically TS surgeries, but I just got my eyebrows Microbladed, and I got Bosley FUT hair transplant (1540 grafts) for my widow&#39;s peak.

Ask me anything at all about these surgeries.  They are definitely a way to denke the facial features.  The eyebrows are an instant game changer and the hair transplant will take about 5-7 months.

Sorry, no can do.  I really don&#39;t like how I look, generally.  I can tell you, though, that the difference is striking and quite dramatic.  I had very blonde brows, and dark brown hair, so it looked like I had no eyebrows before, now I look like I plucked them perfectly, and they&#39;re visible!
</p>
<p>
The initial pain is with it, you feel about 10-15 cuts on either brow and then they put numbing agent on which doesn&#39;t really work on the surface but works really well speaking through the open cuts.  The scrapping sound can be a little bad, too, it reminded me of my cutting days.  They did a total of the passes and I&#39;m supposed to come in in 6 weeks to have the final details and completely filling it done; the fine tuning.    Price was $400USD for the first visit and $150USD for the second visit.

Hi! I was told I would need 1800 and that sounded high. Would you have before/after pics of your hairline?

Sorry, I don&#39;t... I dislike how I look.  For an idea of the area covered on a medium sized hand put all your fingers together (not including the palm)  and that&#39;s the area on each side covered by 1540.

They say you buy 1,000 you get 100 follicles free at a price of $4.50USD per follicle.  They also say they won&#39;t waste any follices they harvest from the donor patch they cut out of the back of your scalp, but won&#39;t charge you extra for the overage.  It worked in my favor as I have VERY thick hair so they miscalculated and ended up pulling 1,540 follicles and divided those evenly between the two sides of the widow&#39;s peak.

I had very irregular looking eyebrows, now I have very defined eyebrows.  To me, it&#39;s more than worth it.

Iâ€™m thinking of doing hair transplant.  Is Bodley the doctor or a method?  I googled them and they seem like a factory mill for hair transplants?

Bosley is a company, not a doctor.  I wouldn&#39;t call it a factory mill, though.
