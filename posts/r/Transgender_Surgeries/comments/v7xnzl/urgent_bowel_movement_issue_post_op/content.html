Fingers and lube. Rubber gloves probably a good idea too.

Can’t imagine though why a vegan diet should be the problem. Wish you all the best!

I&#39;m also vegan and unfortunately the additional fibre from a vegan diet can sometimes cause constipation. I just balance it out with vegan &#39;low fibre&#39; foods tho

I’m a vegan, recently had bottom surgery and have had BMs every single day since post-op day 1.  Several a day.  The only time it hurt was when I had to fly back home, the trip took 14 hours and I didn’t drink because of Covid and no one wearing a mask.  I became dehydrated and it was hard and difficult to have a BM. That lasted 2 days.  I have not used any meds to help me have a BM at all.
</p>
<p>
Make sure your fiber is on point and your drinking plenty of fluids.  One of those is out of balance so you need to figure out which one is.  If it becomes necessary, get a fleets enema.  Once you go, it should improve.
</p>
<p>
Don’t break your vegan diet, it will make matters much worse.  I’m crediting my diet to how rapidly I’m healing.

For all surgeries or anytime i tale opiate pain meds i ask for Movantik. Its a opiate specific constipation medication.
</p>
<p>
I would maybe ask surgeon if enama is a good idea or what else u can do. I would Definitely talk my  doctor agian and do whatever they say.

bullshit, just drink more laxatives. Miralax worked the best for me. GCS gave me the worst constipation by far compared to all my other surgeries.
