I wish I had a more helpful response but I‚Äôm at 7.5 weeks and the depression is REAAAAAL.  Just as bad as the anxiety immediately before.  I just want to be healed and feel good and get in with my life now but I‚Äôm nowhere needed.  Nor I guess can I be and that sucks.  So I just keep telling myself that this is a long process and giving myself as much space as possible and grace in terms of not expecting much.  Which sucks and makes it worse.  But I just keep thinking to maybe this summer.  And how amazing it can be.  Or next holiday season.  Closer than I was, still way too far but closer.
</p>
<p>
Sorry for the rambles.  Going through it and it suuuucks.  Sending so much positivity and healing vibes.  We all deserve so much better and more.  And I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôll get there.

I don&#39;t have any advice on the depression, but just wanted to say, your result looks awesome and will be even more awesome when the inflammation goes down. You&#39;re past the hardest part and you&#39;re gonna thank yourself months from now for doing this. &lt;3
</p>
<p>
Also, don&#39;t be afraid to ask your surgeon or primary care doctor for short term pain management meds if you&#39;re in pain. That&#39;s what they&#39;re there for!

When do you go back taking your hormones again? Didn‚Äôt you have to stop everything for a period of time before your surgery? The outward appearance of your SRS appears to have been done by really good surgeons.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you could talk to your doctors or therapist to let them know of your post-op depression. Do you think you are comfortable enough to follow through what I have suggested? You can do this!
</p>
<p>
Wishing you the best for very happy holidays and for a happy and prosperous new year!

You are going to be just fine. It sounds as if you are going on your journey almost alone. Alone meaning yourself and your thoughts. Times do get lonely sure without company. My thoughts keep me company when things slow down a lot. But, busier days get tossed into mix, too. Have you checked the internet for your area looking for support groups? I‚Äôm OK without any support groups today. I do like my privacy though and what is my business will stay my business as much as I make that come true. Just an idea for you, if you aren‚Äôt in the middle of a vacant desert, try looking up surrounding areas or small towns nearby. If you want privacy like I do check areas out first, keep your ear to the ground and check out other close by areas. You‚Äôve got the rest of your life to let others know your name! That is, after you have done your local research. Make sure you feel comfortable seeking out others. You don‚Äôt want to put yourself into a situation that causes you anxiety. I have trust issues and keep my world around me very private. You‚Äôve got your forever ahead of you so take you time to be good to yourself first. Go slow and don‚Äôt get in a rush to make acquaintances, you need good and close to you people who will keep you PRIVATE. When YOU control your world and are in charge, your depressing thoughts will ease up. You need to sit on top of your depression periods. This is all new to you so take this one step, one day, one minute if you need to really go slow figuring all this out.
</p>
<p>
Be well!

Post op depression is
<em>
real,
</em>
and I wish I could say that goes away quickly. Mine hung around for a while, and then upon stage 2 of my surgery it came back pretty hard.
</p>
<p>
But it does go away. The pain goes away. The degiscence WILL heal, and you&#39;ll be okay. Results look great.
</p>
<p>
If a little destination anticipation helps, things start to look ship shape around 6 months. After a year, quite well including good progress on nerve connection healing.
</p>
<p>
Stay strong. Nap often, drink water. I&#39;m rooting for you. ‚ù§

Hey, so I also had dehiscence of one of my sutures shortly after surgery. It really sucked but it healed really well and now it&#39;s like it never happened. Between that and the usual post op depression it was rough, but I can tell you from experience that it&#39;ll be ok.
</p>
<p>
Idk what your... &#34;Personal time&#34; schedule was like before surgery, but I know the lack of endorphins from that after surgery was tough for me.
</p>
<p>
Before you know it you&#39;ll be healed and fully functional and the next part of the adventure is so worth it.
</p>
<p>
I made some educational and instructional videos that I can share a link with anyone who wants them, but they are 18+ and some of them are a little spicy.
</p>
<p>
Good luck and congratulations üéâ
