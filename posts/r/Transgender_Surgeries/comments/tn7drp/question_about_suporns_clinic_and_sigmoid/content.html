I&#39;ve been considering for the past two years whether I should invest in travelling for bottom surgery or not. Doing it in my country would cost a LOT less money but the results are recognized to be substantially poor in quality (I live in Brazil).
</p>
<p>
It would take me a few years to gather the money necessary for it, and when I get there, there would still be one more problem...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve read that Suporn&#39; method reutilizes the materials in the genital area (and only those materials) to construct the vagina, and when there aren&#39;t many of those resources available people don&#39;t usually recommend his Clinic.
</p>
<p>
My husband is uhm... a bit big (LMAO) and I&#39;m really scared of performing the surgery and simply not being able to have sex after (especially as people often claim it to be so useful to perform it instead of dillating)
</p>
<p>
Also I&#39;ve heard that for easier dillating and a larger vagina in general, the Sigmoid method is more recommended.
</p>
<p>
My question is, does Suporn clinic perform the Sigmoid method, or at least an adapted version of it? If not, what do you guys recommend?
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much in advance!
</p>
<p>
EDIT: I&#39;ve been in HRT for two years already and I&#39;ve been circumsized as a child, so I think the materials for his method are really little.

I&#39;ve been with Dr. Theerapong in Thailand about 2 weeks ago. I booked peritoneal option but he also offers sigmoid colon option for a bit less money. For me he created ~6.5&#34; depth. He is a very well reputed surgeon for Thai girls and becoming more popular with foreigners.

Hi, I have some questions about your experience with Dr. Teerapong (well, there are a lot of them, sorry for that), could you please help me? I plan go with him (for PPT): What made you choose Dr. Teerapong over other doctors? Do you recommend him? What technique did you have for your SRS and why? (Penile Skin Inversion with scrotal graft, scrotal graft, Sigmoid Colon or PPT) Did you have circumcision before your SRS? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity so far? What is your vaginal depth? How is the process of dilations? They are painful? Are you planning to have revision surgery? and if so.. What would you improve your result with one? How was your stay in Thailand? How was the aftercare of Dr. Teerapong and the clinic staff in general? That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.

I can recommend him. Had PPT and no circumcision. I chose him because I wanted to get ppt surgery, liked his aesthetics with how he creates the small labia to go all the way down and the hooded clitoris, and also because he has so much experience and is well reputed in Thailand. Vaginal depth is about 6.5&#34;. I am very happy with my results sensitivity is very good and I think that&#39;s because Dr. Thee discards none of the glans but instead splits it to create the visible part of the clitoris and puts the remaining parts in different places. I can tell that things beare very sensitive during cleaning. I will decide when fully healed if I want anything revised and it would only be the labia because for the rest I can already tell that it&#39;s fine. The labia are too swollen for now to tell whether I like how they end up, also because I asked him to rather have bigger ones than too small to close up together. I think he said he would do a labia revision for free if needed.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is quite easy for me. Don&#39;t really have pain during dilation. Just minor discomfort occasionally.
</p>
<p>
Have zero complications so far. Wound heals very fast. Could already walk around when I left the hospital on day 7, albeit looking funny with legs broadened due to swelling. But of course energy is limited.
</p>
<p>
Experience in the hospital was really tough, as I was bound to bed for six full days with restricted movements possible due to the packaging. Nurses were okay but couldn&#39;t speak English very well. But not sure they could have made the experience in hospital much better. Would be nice if they&#39;d given a morphine drip, but they rather injected it for the first 3 days, but just stopped at day 4. Pain on the surgical site was totally fine but I had pain from gas in my bowel and the pressure that caused, luckily worst on day 3 where I still got pain medication. Food in hospital was awful, but I only got it on day 5-7. Aftercare with clinic is fine if too, booked extra nursing care. Difficult to rate the experience in the hospital as positive when it is inherently such a hard thing to go through. I was so happy when I got out.

Currently Suporn Clinic won’t change their technique, but their current technique does have a higher than usual depth.
</p>
<p>
There’s plenty of other surgery in Thailand, but whoever you go make sure you look at that actual results rather than marketing.
</p>
<p>
You may also find things have changed in Thailand in a few years as to who does what.

Dr Suporn, 19 weeks ago. Small penis, poorly circumcised. Current depth 20cm.
</p>
<p>
As I understand it, attainable depth with Suporn Clinic surgeons depends more on body size/configuration than available material. I am 182cm tall.

Don&#39;t you think about Marcio Littleton in Brazil? Nowadays he performs two techniques: jejunum and peritoneal

Neither Suporn nor Banks perform the sigmoid method... but why would you want a more invasive and riskier surgery?. If lubrication is what you want, you could end getting more than what you signed up for. And, if something goes wrong, I am not sure what other techniques would be available for you.
</p>
<p>
I went to Suporn, I was circumcised (and the surgeon probably went too far when I was a baby). I had about 10 cm at most after &gt;5y HRT. Let&#39;s just say that I never had to tuck.
</p>
<p>
When Suporn examined me he said that he could get me 5 1/2&#39;-6&#34;. I asked about the tunica vaginalis, she said that it was still experimental but that they could use it (they use it also when the material is scarce). I decided NOT to go for it and just have the standard procedure. He uses the urethral tissue to make the dome, which provides extra length and a little bit of lube (not enough). However, I can certainly produce a lot more from the Russel glands that are left...  And the truth is that even cisgender women often need lubrication, specially for multiple/prolonged intercourse. I would add that since my 5th month I have had no problems with discharge which is... a blessing, and no problems with odor. Nothing is more uncomfortable and irritating than having to wear pads or liners.
</p>
<p>
Well, at almost 7 months post op I have a solid 6.7&#34; (17 cm) and can dilate with a 38 m dilator (orange soul source dilators) in addition to the ones that support provide (M 31 mm and L 34 mm) . I am a lesbian but I am pretty sure I would have no issues with a guy. And as I am just at 7 months, could likely widen it even more if needed down the road. One thing is sure though: you will have to put your effort and discipline and dilate.
</p>
<p>
Some girls have even deeper vaginas, but I would make two comments about this: a long neovagina may translate into longer (and potentially more painful) dilations during the first months. Second, who needs 18 cm or 7&#34;?. Average cisgender vaginas are about 4&#34; and can stretch some, but not to 7&#34;.  I know this because I am a physician and could always reach the cervix with my fingers.  I cannot reach my vaginal dome at all. If you partner is well endowed in terms of length, keep in mind that part of that length will always be left outside.. so a 6&#34; vaina could accommodate easily a 7&#34; appendix.
</p>
<p>
I would not worry about depth with Suporn or Banks, their technique gets excellent depths. If needed they can add the tunica (which I honestly believe most people do not need).
</p>
<p>
Finally, their cosmetic results, once the inflammation comes down, are superb... way superior to what others provide in my opinion (it is just my opinion, but in the 30 years that have passed since I started med school, I have had the opportunity to see a lot).

So I went with a PI with a surgeon close to home on my insurance. My results are fine. I have the ability to experience pleasure and my vulva looks very cis according to my gyno.
</p>
<p>
But I feel like I missed the boat with the Suporn technique.
</p>
<p>
Am I SOL for a revision that achieves something like Suporn?
