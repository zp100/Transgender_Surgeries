What are these things between my labia majora and minora and what should I do? Post-op day 14. I&#39;ve informed the clinic but I have to wait for another few days before the doctor can see me.

Don&#39;t pull on separation. Not to take a picture, not to rinse, not for anything, until your surgeon tells you it&#39;s safe. As others have said, get attention for this. But this picture should never have been taken.

Okay thanks. I&#39;ve never actually try to separate my labia majora and minora until today, when I decided to take a look.  Now I&#39;ll try my best to avoid taking another look, although I think I would be so anxious about how it heals in the following weeks if not months. ðŸ˜­

&lt;nod&gt; Just leave it be.  The white layer you&#39;re seeing is called &#34;slough&#34; which is technically dead skin tissue.  Good news is its totally normal so long as the tissue below it is healthy.  You should keep it clean with gentle rinses and per your Surgeon&#39;s cleaning instructions.
</p>
<p>
As the area with slough heals the white tissue should slowly flake and fall away similar to a scab.  The living tissue under the white slough should stay pink/light-red indicating it&#39;s healing and not infected.  Once the white falls off enough you may form a normal skin scab.  Indications of problems would be the wound turning dark black/brown/yellow and a very putrid smell coming from it.  Note that the normal healing process for GRS can be very smelly anyway.
</p>
<p>
As others said its good to leave it alone and query your doctor.  But I&#39;m quite certain they&#39;ll tell you the same, but they may give you some special instructions for caring for it as it heals.

Show your doctor a picture. Just to be safe.

The nurses had already taken some pictures and made an appointment for me. Still I feel sad. Hopefully this does not turn into some abscess or severe infection...

The soft yellowish tissue is dead tissue. It&#39;s normal. Your surgeon will likely have you place gauze there and change it regularly. The gauze will gently and gradually take the yellowish tissue away. Don&#39;t mess with it. Just contact your surgeon. Best of luck to you

Thanks. I tried to remove those yellowish things today with a tiny cotton stick but they just stay there. Probably I&#39;m not trying hard enough, I don&#39;t know.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll wait for my appointment and see what my doctor is gonna tell me. And thank you.

No no it only comes off slowly and gradually with the gauze over time. But talk to your surgeon because I&#39;m not a doctor I&#39;m just going by what I went through

Dr. Kamol? Like others have, it&#39;s best to have the surgeon look at it, but it doesn&#39;t look too concerning at the moment.

I really hope there&#39;s nothing to worry about I fear that it might make me unable to return to work at 12 weeks...
</p>
<p>
I really want my doctor to have a look but the nurses said I have to wait until Monday, I guess it&#39;s not a good idea to have a complication on Friday here. And yes you guessed right, it&#39;s doctor K.

It looks like a really good result, I wouldnâ€™t worry about it too much. That type of thing looks very common for healing results. All the best of luck!!!
