Hello all!
</p>
<p>
I  decided that I want clavicle shortening surgery and after a few months  of serious thinking, consulted with Dr. Leif Rogers just yesterday. I  had a couple special request for him and also found a bit of information  I hadn&#39;t come across by previous research, so thought I&#39;d share here.
</p>
<p>
First,  I was REALLY happy to hear that he prefers not to use plates at all any  more. He uses some kind of internal screw that&#39;s installed through the  length of the bone through a very small incision above the shoulder. He  said it doesn&#39;t work for all bone sizes/shapes, but it does for most,  and that with this there&#39;s no lump under the skin whatsoever. I was  ecstatic to hear this, and that my clavicles appear to be a good normal  size for this technique.
</p>
<p>
But more  good/interesting news is scapula shaving! I&#39;m *as* interested in wanting my shoulders to  have that forward-sloping structure that a female frame has, and which I  don&#39;t, as I am about reducing the appearance of width. But I have these  weird points behind my shoulders, on the scapulae, which bug me! I  wondered if those bumps on my scapula could be shaved down, and he&#39;s  going to do it! The incision would either be at the upper part of the  armpit or on top of the shoulder, depending on my preference.  The pictures is showing what bump I mean.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if  I&#39;m going to be on his operating table anyway and blowing all this money  I may as well do as much as possible. So I&#39;m also asking him to do some  fat grafting (hips, buttocks), but I also made another special request  to graft some to my knees to round them out some more. I&#39;d rather not  share too many pictures, but my legs are pretty feminine TBH, except  that I&#39;ve always hated how knobby they can look when I&#39;m sitting. It&#39;s a  funny thing where if I wear either short shorts my legs look good, or  capris or a long skirt, but in between... anything that shows just a bit  of my knees, somehow makes my legs look all masculine. He&#39;s going to  add some roundness to me knees, which also isn&#39;t really a procedure I&#39;ve  seen mentioned before, and another thing I&#39;m super excited about.
</p>
<p>
Also  fwiw, I&#39;ve been on HRT for 17 years, had SRS like 15 year ago, and I&#39;m  5&#39;7&#34; with a 16&#34; biacromial width, which is about an inch wider than the  female average for my height, and which is about right on the middle of  the male average. This is good:

I know there is a sugern in California that does it for $40,000. Seen the before and after pictures, couldn&#39;t see any difference tbh.

This is him, yes.
</p>
<p>
TBH I feel like the results are pretty subjective. If you look at cis women, one&#39;s impression of shoulder width can change drastically day to day just from wardrobe. But I find if I look at after pictures of women who&#39;ve had this surgery, there&#39;s an unmistakably female quality of their shoulders that can *only* be obtained otherwise by playing with angles and lighting.
</p>
<p>
To me, the point is to not have to be constantly  self conscious about my shoulders, and as results go, the reduction of about an inch in biachromial width is not-subjective and to me is pretty signficant, whether or not it&#39;s obvious in b/a pictures. Whereas now I *always* dress to de-emphasize my shoulders, it will be amazing to be able to just wear &#34;whatever&#34;. That and the forward-curving appearance which is an absolutely stunning quality when seen from the side and back is more than enough for me to go for it.
</p>
<p>
As I saw someone on Reddit say once, there&#39;s &#34;passing&#34; and there&#39;s &#34;unmistakable female&#34;. I&#39;ve always passed, but I&#39;m at a point in life where I can afford some extra surgery to get to that state of having some unmistakable female features, and I find that I really want that for myself.

I&#39;m coming in VERY late to the party on this thread, but do you have examples of &#34;passing&#34; versus &#34;unmistakable female&#34; shoulders? I&#39;ve never really thought about it that way. But I do have slightly wider shoulders and they&#39;re a feature that I&#39;m very self-conscious about, so I&#39;m interested to learn more about this. I&#39;ve seen the two examples of shoulder reduction surgery here on Reddit that probably everyone has viewed, but are there more?

Me too and I feel like my shoulder shape is not feminine since puberty. I never saw any genetic woman that have those shoulders.

As I said I seen the before and after pictures and I couldn&#39;t see any difference. Also can&#39;t be good having bones cut in half and knitted together. That is going to cause problems in the future.

Did you go through with the surgery yet? My shoulders bug me extremely and make it so I have basically zero chance of passing so I want to know if you did and how it went and your opinion of the doctor’s performance

I get it, it does *seem* extreme, but no more so than someone treated for a broken clavicle, which I think people forget. I&#39;m somewhat athletic and not having some long term issues are important to me, and I did talk to him about that quite a bit to see if I would come away with more or less confidence. I came away with more.
</p>
<p>
Of course, only time will tell, but at one time all the procedures we undergo were seen as extreme or invasive. I might also add that there are reasons I chose this particular surgeon.
</p>
<p>
P.S., thanks, I do enjoy my work.

Be careful with the fat grafting to the knees.  Bitd a lot of girls were getting silicone in their legs and having problems with migrations.  I think migration is still a risk with fat grafting.  You might want to ask about that.

That&#39;s a REALLY good point. Thank you, I will ask. These added procedures on top of the clavicle work added a lot more to the price than I expected though so I&#39;m reconsidering the knees anyway.

If you have hip dysphoria you should look into hip implants

Tbh because of male puberty I will never be completely confortable before I fix most of the things they bother me. And my shoulders are one of them. Of course my face and hips are important but..

I&#39;ve heard that hip implants are not very aesthetic and the results are photoshopped on their website but idk. I think I will do fat transfer to my hips instead.
