Hey folks I’m starting to do my research and learn more about bottom surgery in preparation for applying later this year.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering if you could run me through or link me to more info about penile inversion vs peritoneal vs suporn technique. (And your opinions/experience)
</p>
<p>
I’m from Canada and I’m currently debating either going to GRS Montreal, Suporn clinic, or elsewhere depending on the type of surgery I decide on.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your input!

Idk the suporn technique. This is just my opinions and off the top of my head.
</p>
<p>
Pros of penile inversion: it’s had way more time to be improved and there’s a more collective experience available (both from patients and surgeons), also most available.
</p>
<p>
Cons of penile inversion: usually requires electrolysis, can have limitations based on available tissue.
</p>
<p>
Pros of peritoneal: typically no hair removal needed (according to my surgeon), more lubrication (but most say you still need lube), depth isn’t as restricted based on penile tissue.
</p>
<p>
Cons of peritoneal: less available and experience, can be harder to schedule since it often needs another surgeon doing robot assisted stuff, surgeons generally dont it if you’ve had abdominal surgery before, since it’s newer on trans women there’s not much data on long-term results yet.

Yeah I’m genuinely worried that not having a ton of source material will lead to shitty depth with penile inversion.
</p>
<p>
Sorry so peritoneal is encouraged if you’ve already had abdominal surgery??

Edited. They generally don’t do PPT if you’ve had abdominal surgery

Oh okay. I’m having a tummy tuck in March so that might be an issue then.

I&#39;m in Ontario and although I probably will never be able to afford srs I&#39;ve done a fair bit of research on it personally my favorite method for the canal is the colon method because after a bit of time the colon graft becomes the same as the lining of a natal vagina, it is self lubricating/self cleaning, it can maintain a proper bacterial colony without extra maintenance, and other then the healing period you don&#39;t have to stress about dilating before sex or having to dilate weekly for the rest of your life.
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UN-NVge8XmY">Here
</a>
is a video of different neovagina methods from the inside (skip to 6:20) My first choice for doctor is Dr. Theerapong
<a href="http://thesexchange.com/">(his results website)
</a>
although I prefer the look of dr. Bank&#39;s
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/101s492/6_months_postop_srs_with_dr_bank/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">results
</a>
from the suporn clinic because I prefer the smaller hidden labia minora. I did ask dr. Theerapong&#39;s clinic if he would be able to make the labia small and they said it should be possible.

If you’re in Ontario, OHIP does cover SRS, if that’s a route you’d like to take! There’s a lot of paperwork and red tape, but it’s likely worth it.

They won&#39;t cover it for anything other than piv which at this point I would rather wait then go with that method not to mention I doubt they would cover a surgeon from Thailand

Well, that’s disappointing! I hadn’t looked much into it yet myself as that stage is pretty far down the road for me still.

Pretty much the main clinic they cover is grs Montreal and I don&#39;t like their results or method. They also have multiple lawsuits against them.

Thank you so much for this write up!! I feel like we’re exactly on the same wavelength regarding “perfectionism” and the differences between Montreal/Suporn. I’m in the same boat where I can afford Suporn and I think I like the aesthetics and greater depth more.
</p>
<p>
I actually feel really reassured right now that you basically wrote out my own thought process on the whole thing. I’ve felt unable to organize my thoughts about it. Thanks ❤️
</p>
<p>
Do you have any tips for how contacting/booking at suporn goes?

Thank you for the heads up! So pretty much get the profile done, and be ready when they announce spots.
</p>
<p>
Can that pre-written email say I’ll take any available spot or do I actually have to be specific?

I feel similarly to you, although personally I think many people getting results that look identical is a pro as long as the results are good and what you&#39;d like. The biggest thing that scare me about surgery is inconsistency, seeing some results I&#39;d love and some I couldn&#39;t live with from the same surgeon is kinda terrifying.
