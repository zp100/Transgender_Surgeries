WTF is with all of the wires???  I have never had any kind of hair removal that used something like that.  Electrolysis is done hair by hair - not with a contraption that looks like someone was attempting to perform electrical reinforcement training.
</p>
<p>
So sorry you went through this and basically have nothing to show.  Might want to contact the BBB as well (and possibly the state licensing board), since they don&#39;t seem to know even remotely what they are doing.

Hang in there! 💜💜

I can&#39;t see this being any more efficient than one-by-one.  By the time all of those probes are inserted, a skilled *trained* electrologist could have zapped at least as many hairs and tweezed them.

Not going to comment on the work at BHHF, but the machine she uses is fairly well-known. All of the needles are on their own individual circuits.
</p>
<p>
For the original multi needle devices from back in the day, yes, you would insert each needle, and after each insertion, you would then turn up the current appropriately, because they were all in parallel. This had issues where some pathways had a lower resistance, leading to overtreating some follicles and undertreating others. Modern machines don&#39;t do this.

Is that supposed to be better than hair by hair? Seems like the time and effort to set that up would be less efficient.

It&#39;s a multi-needle method which is used in combination with slower forms of electrolysis such as the old school galvanic and blend methods that can take several seconds per follicle. You keep a rotation of needles so that each one stays in long enough rather than slowly doing one by one.

Yeah... still seems like those insertion angles are going to be all wrong for properly targeting the root.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯

With the galvanic methods it destroys the root via the production of lye so absolute accuracy is less important. The lye is mobile and fills the area and continues to work even after the needle is removed.
</p>
<p>
Whereas with thermolysis accuracy is extremely important because you&#39;re doing a targeted attack taking less than a tenth of a second.
</p>
<p>
The multi needle method is also a statistical trade off. Basically you know you&#39;re reducing accuracy to some extent but it&#39;s offset by volume over time. 10 needles at once with 50% accuracy is a faster kill rate than 1 needle at a time with 100% accuracy.

Thank u for chiming in. I’m going to BHHF currently and they use the 32 prong galvanic. I got full coverage on my first visit for bottom prep. It’s definitely effective. Sorry OP that you couldn’t get worked into schedule. That really sucks. I have quite a bit of flexibility so I haven’t had the same issue. Also I am not going to them for face just bottom prep to give context.

It&#39;s an old way of doing it, turning the fluid in the follicle into lye so it destroys the root.
</p>
<p>
The newer faster way targets each follicle with a different sort of electric charge that burns it. It&#39;s much quicker but can hurt a lot more.
</p>
<p>
Personally i think OP has dark looking hair and light skin and would benefit from laser first then electrolysis to finish the rest off.
</p>
<p>
Alao 4 years is nothing. I have had over 150 hours over 5 years and it&#39;s still there a bit. I maybe need another 100 until I&#39;m happy with it.

But... they still do galvanic today, just with a single probe.  I see no advantage to a multi probe approach, and a whole bunch of potential negatives (such as the probe to hair shaft angle isn&#39;t going to be correct when you let it droop like that).
</p>
<p>
Thermolysis and Blend (combination) are newer, and they have their place alongside galvanic.  In fact, when I had my bottom surgery prep they used a combination of the three - Blend to start, then either thermo or galvanic depending on the root quality of the remaining hairs.
</p>
<p>
Electro can, and does, remove hair well - but only when it is done by someone with the proper experience.

I think it&#39;s just that galvanic takes longer, up to 30s per hair rather than less than 0.5s with therm. My salon tech averages about 6s per hair with therm/ burning them including the insersion plucking it out. She doesnt offer galvanic at all even though her machine will do it.
</p>

Whatever works though. I wish it was easier being a red head lol

Galvanic is 8 seconds per hair. 6 seconds means its blend, that’s the minimum time needed to convert water/salt into lye.

There&#39;s also the fast blend technique originally pioneered by Hinkle I believe that only takes ~1 sec but for whatever reason very few people practice it despite being really effective.

With my setup it&#39;s anywhere between 20-40s.  There is virtually no pain with this low current.  Produces the same amount of lie over longer time.

I think we all wish this process could be easier for sure.  But yeah, I really feel for those who have red, blond or gray hairs - I hear those suckers are even more stubborn to get out (never mind the lower likelihood of laser being useful).  Hang in there!  💜💜

The problem is the months in between appointments, I&#39;m upset because they should have told me they didn&#39;t have enough space in their schedule. Instead of leading me on, if you&#39;re accepting clients you&#39;re making a commitment to them to provide the agreed upon service

Months between appointments means each session has a random chance of being applied to follicles in the growth phase. Clearing a gradually moving area each week means the technician can see which follicles are growing in subsequent weeks and destroy them.

No way you&#39;ll be done in 6-10, I&#39;ve had probably like 50 90 minute electrolysis treatments as well as maybe 15 laser (doing both cause I have a good amount of grey in my facial hair) and I still have a way to go, although it is SO MUCH BETTER than it was.

Ive done 2 places where after many sessions I saw basically no improvement . Then I found the one I’m at now, each session is like a 50% reduction. After 4 or 5 sessions I can count the hairs still growing. The only downside is that it hurts 3x or more than the others

This is multi probe Galvanic electrolysis. I get the same thing here in Oz. It’s slower than thermo or blend but is more effective with basically a 100% kill rate as it converts water in the hair follicle to Lye which kills it for good. Where I get my treatment there are 16 probes which are left on for a period of about five minutes. Each one has a very fine needle inserted right beside the hair down into the follicle - the fact that the wires dangle has no effect on this as they are very light weight and don’t really pull on the electrode once it has been inserted. You wear an earth band on your arm to complete the electrical circuit. The machine is computer controlled and cycles the electrical current. Yes it’s slower, but it’s actually better.

The results are excellent. It’s slow, it’s painful, and the cost really adds up over time so it gets expensive as well, but unlike laser, it’s permanent. Every single hair treated will never come back and if you have grey or red hair (that laser can’t target) then it’s really your only option.

I thought with enough sessions that laser was permanent and electrolysis was just to finish up what couldn&#39;t be done with laser?

Laser is kinda semi-permanent. It’s great for clearing large area’s fast, but some hair follicles will survive and come back over time which will need to be retreated with maintenance sessions every so often which will vary from person to person according to the individual and their hair type. Laser is definitely a great weapon to have in the anti hair arsenal - I’ve had many sessions of it from head to toe and everywhere in between - it’s just not as final as good Galvanic Electrolysis.

I’m not gunna lie - for electrolysis I get 2hr sessions and it pretty much sucks, but I’m a do it once and do it right kinda girl. I also get a prescription for a 23% lidocaine numbing cream which definitely helps, but it still hurts. Basically it feels like bee stings but not on every hair. Depending on how close an individual hair is to a nerve, it can really sting like heck and others you can barely feel at all. Worth it though as every single hair removed is one I’ll never have to deal with again.

I like how everyone is automatically downvoting anyone who has had a positive experience with Beverly Hair Free without knowing anything about it. I went there for electrolysis for bottom surgery and it took five sessions over three years. That’s right -five four hour sessions and I was done. I felt no pain doing it even with 24 hairs being zapped at a time because I went and got lidocaine shots before. I literally fell asleep one time. The hours spent getting electrolysis at a multi node place like this are a fraction of others. And I have not found a single hair in my canal or the other places they worked. I would recommend them to anyone. I’m sorry this person had a bad experience but electrolysis takes years and it’s normal to have to book four months out for a place as busy as this.

I had my first session with her about three weeks ago and it was a great experience. I’ve also read reviews where people complained about their bedside manner. We live in a world where people hate us, and our treatments are a mix of finding tolerant people and under researched science.
</p>
<p>
BHHF is very trans accepting, their method is effective, and the desk clerk and electrologist were very polite and responsive. Though, that was my experience. The experience the OP described was a shocker to me. No pun intended.
</p>
<p>
Though, I won’t reject their experience. I wasn’t there and perhaps there’s more to the story.

Yes I don’t mean to invalidate OPs experience. Maybe there are even more details than we know as well. My point is the general negativity in this thread about this place and the method and the amount of nodes. Doing 24 hairs at a time is incredible. Electrolysis is such a fucking nightmare, especially for gcs prepping. I’d hate for people to discount this route. I see so many people suffering and just balling and dreading the dozens of appointments they have to go to. And for me I feel lucky I found this place.

Yeah they will put in an appointment/order for you at this medical center about half a mile away. So you can go to the med center an hour before and get numbed up. They really nuke your crotch from space with lidocaine. Some hairs on the edge that maybe didn’t get as much numbing were painful to zap at times. But like I said overall it was so easy that I fell asleep in one of the sessions.
</p>
<p>
I should add that the lidocaine shot costs extra. (I’m assuming op did not do this) You pay the med center. So it’s something you have to pay out of pocket for and get reimbursed if you can. Ultimately I paid for some of my hair removal out of pocket, some of it I was able to bill to insurance, and some of it I submitted a super bill that saved me money in combination with other surgeries going over my out of pocket. I know everyone has different access to resources so I am aware that I am lucky to able to go the route I did for gcs hair removal.

That’s multi-probe galvanic. I can’t speak to anything about their services, but it’s not “Frankenstein” or anything for people to get hysterical about. It’s the original form of electrolysis and very effective if done right but very few people do it now and it’s “an art form” I was told. True galvanic takes a long time per hair so they found a way to do many probes at once, hence the many wires. There’s nothing unprofessional or weird about it. I  can’t speak to how good THEY are at it, just that the technique itself it sound and is the “real” electrolysis that predates thermolysis and blend by decades.

So I go to BHHF, and wish to provide a different view on them, without undermining OPs experience.
</p>
<p>
I go to New Age Electrolysis (NAE) for my facial electro (Lancaster), and they do thermolysis. I’ve had close to 20 hours now and I still have a significant amount of regrowth, but it is not super painful and Jeanette &amp; Jennifer are incredibly supportive and polite. While the process is slow as hell, my experience with them has been “friendly to everyone and trans affirming”. I say all that, to give preface to my experience with electrolysis as a trans woman.
</p>
<p>
Onto BHHF, where I am going for bottom surgery preparation - The technician has a personality that vibes with me. Our conversations were great, and she was reassuring that my rambling was OK. The pain was much worse than therm at NAE, for the nerve endings that didn’t get the lidocaine, but it was bearable. As for results, I’ve had ONE treatment and I have very little regrowth. It’s extremely effective, at least for my bottom area. My experience has been “busy place with a different treatment method, but extremely effective and very affirming treatment by the staff”. YMMV.
</p>
<p>
I’m against statements like “Do not go here”. While OP’s experience is valid, everyone’s experience is different. I think statements like that need to be reserved for places that are transphobic, dangerous, or traumatizing. BHHF may fall short of some people’s expectations, but they are NOT a dangerous or traumatizing clinic to work with. Remember - WE are the customers. Insurance or not. If they aren’t meeting your expectations as a customer, it’s time to go elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
As for their method - There is an upvoted comment here explaining what the process is and how effective it is. I can’t explain it any better than they did and it’s a great explanation. It’s different for sure, but it’s also extremely effective. If I had to GUESS at what happened for the OP, their treatments were so far spread out that they didn’t catch the hair in the anagen phase and didn’t effectively stop the regrowth.
</p>
<p>
I denounce the “pretending to be allies of the LGBTW community”. The technician and the assistant were both incredibly affirming, didn’t mess up once, and did a lot of work with me on trying to work out the insurance and the scheduling. All things they didn’t have to do. It’s easy to tell when people are putting on a face. I did not get that impression here.
</p>
<p>
Go to BHHF with the expectation that they are a very busy clinic, and be humble with the technician and her administrative assistant. What we have to go through sucks, but remember that they are people too, doing a service that takes a lot of patience and sees a lot of clients from all kinds of different backgrounds. To do what she does you have to be effective, efficient, polite, knowledgeable, licensed, patient, communicative, committed, delicate, supportive, assertive, and so many other things. You have to be very careful with the various experiences of people coming in having VERY sensitive and dysphoric work done on them in a very delicate time of their lives, and you have to care for them for four hours or more and then move onto the next client right afterwards who is going to be a complete 180 from the last client you saw…. It’s not something I’d be willing to do.
</p>
<p>
If she isn’t butchering people, I would suggest trying to find other terms to use.

That is really awful. Even more so because they advertise 30x speed removing hair permanently vs other procedures. Also, what are they doing in that photo? Electrolysis?

I have friends who did galvanic and had a lot of discoloration and scaring.  I go to Layla in west LA.  She’s simply the best.  I did laser at marina med spa 4 sessions then electrolysis.  2yrs and haven’t shaved since.  Highly recommend.

Never seen anything like this I&#39;ve completed electrolysis one probe  can hurt enough  but all these have to be torture. I hope this works for you.

The process was fine, my problem with them is they weren&#39;t giving me enough appointments. I would wait months in between appointments, they shouldn&#39;t take more clients than they can handle considering it can take a couple hundred hours to finish electrolysis, they wasted my time

If it works that&#39;s great I&#39;m sure it&#39;s faster to get results.

I went to Beverly Hills hair free and my experience was superb but I also paid out of pocket for services so that might be why.

Yes, my experience at both locations were good and friendly and professional. I also don’t have any hair regrowth. It stopped at the second treatment.

Damn, I&#39;ve only been going for 3 weeks and they already cleared most of my upper lip and chin.  4 years sounds expensive :(

This looks crazy. I get a lot of electrolysis every week and I&#39;ve never seen a crazy setup like this.
