Hi everyone! Long time since my last update, but just suffice to say I&#39;m more confused on my healing than anything, but overall, pain is almost all gone. Perfectly functional urine/canal wise, but I&#39;m concerned about what&#39;s going on clitorally.
</p>
<p>
What is going on there? Theres a split that is not healing/healing slowly and the whole area looks weird. Is that my clitoris? I&#39;m just scared to actually touch it. Can&#39;t tell if its granulation tissue or not. I know I VERY much have sexual feeling/sensitivity, but confused about where? I have a lot of feeling above the clitoris (where the labia minora are fused/I think sewn together) which seems odd to me. I dunno.
</p>
<p>
But honestly, aesthetics are pretty bad IMO, due to that labia necrosis. Not Wittenberg&#39;s fault, could be the use of penile skin, but that necrosis/tissue sloughing is just my body.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is easy now, but just sucks doing 3x a day at this point. I guess all my questions will be answered at my 3 month postop, will update after that, then maybe one more either 6month or 1 year postop.

Oh, now that I look back, I sent this:

, to my doc as I had some questions on October 20, so I guess that tear is healing a lot, it might just take another few weeks to heal completely.

I think you’re healing nicely! I’m sorry about the split. The photos are kind of close up and blurry though? And I’m curious about how much you’re spreading the labia with your fingers, to me that seems like it could delay healing and cause infection? But maybe it’s normal. I really do think it’ll be great when it’s fully healed :) 9 weeks is only a drop in the bucket!

I&#39;m almost never parting my labia due to it still healing. Only check every few days to a week just to see &#34;how&#34; its healing, otherwise my clitoris stay invisible 99% of the time.
</p>
<p>
And sorry about the blurriness, my phone camera is crap and its hard to take a picture just positioning wise, and I have to use a mirror to do it but the mirror don&#39;t stay put, ugh.

Hi pretty, I have some questions about your experience with PPT (well, there are a lot of them), could you please help me? I plan to undergo this technique (or the non-inversion technique of Suporn): Did you undergo the hybrid technique (where half of the vagina is skin and the other half is peritoneal tissue) or the full technique (where the entire vaginal canal is peritoneal tissue)? What made you choose Dr. Wittenberg over other doctors? Do you recommend her? What made you choose PPT over other techniques? Do you recommend it as a technique for SRS? How do you consider your results in terms of aesthetics and sensitivity? Are you satisfied with your results? Are you planning to have a revision surgery? And if you plan to have one, What would you improve your result with one? What is your vaginal depth? How is self-lubrication? Do you douching or is there some degree of self-cleaning in your vagina? How have the dilations been?, That&#39;s all for now, and by the way, many congratulations on the surgery and the possible happiness it brought you.
