Ok, so surgeons look at vaginas way differently than we do.  They&#39;re very happy with the swelling, normal wound separation, symmetry, anatomy.
</p>
<p>
I just see rotting flesh, lol.  I passed my pee test, I don&#39;t do well in public :/
</p>
<p>
So we&#39;re optimistic and in 10 more weeks I should look healed, I&#39;m hoping a little sooner, at least on the outside so I can stop destroying my underwear.

You seem to be doing well. It looks like your wound separation is well on its way to healing up. As swelling goes down that should speed up a bit. Your labia look great too.

Thanks
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I don&#39;t notice any spreading of the wound separation the last couple days.  Dr is happy with how shallow the separation is.  I suppose deeper would take longer to heal and more likely to scar.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t want much inner labia, bc I think I don&#39;t like it when it doesn&#39;t come out right.  But it came out really good.  And definitely helped me have a nice hood.  I still hope they tuck inside the outer lips when I&#39;m all healed.
</p>
<p>
I still go back to my immediate post op pic and think about how amazing this should be now that I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s healthy and healing

In that picture? Yes.
</p>
<p>
I had them explain what&#39;s happening bc when I&#39;m more opened, it&#39;s longer, and vertical.  I thought I had the worst shaped clit.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s like, oh no, that&#39;s just bc it&#39;s swollen to that diameter, but the sides are cut off from view.
</p>
<p>
So it&#39;s crazy swollen.  But it will go down and look pretty good.  I think the hood is fairly large so my guess is it will look like this in the picture when retracted.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for liking it ðŸ˜Š
