Hi guys! I just started lidocaine injections for Genital Electrolysis, my first appointment without lidocaine injection, just an OTC lidocaine cream, was so horrifically painful I was crying and had to cut the appointment short by 15 minutes. I was hesitant to use lidocaine injections as I&#39;ve heard multiple, multiple times it feels like lava, it&#39;s horrible, one of the worst injections ever. So bc of that I had SO MUCH ANXIETY.
</p>
<p>
So I went around looking for ways to reduce pain of the lidocaine injection, one was buffering the solution with sodium bicarbonate, which seems to be iffy and not totally worth it, but then I came across a few studies where the area is iced beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s an article which talks about it:
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1D15FY">https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1D15FY
</a>
</p>
<p>
My electrologist said no to numbing w cream beforehand due to possible lidocaine toxicity from both injection and a cream so this was literally the only thing to try. AND IT WORKED! I was super confused because the injections just felt like Un-numbed electrolysis, thought the injections WERE electrolysis lol, while the actual electrolysis felt like NOTHING. I was so freaking happy. My electrologist at Senza Pelo Med Spa in AZ (does long form electro/lidocaine injections) said she had never seen someone ice beforehand. So please, if y&#39;all are scared  about pain, just ice beforehand, a couple semi painful injections, then you just can RELAX for the rest of your appointment. It&#39;s so freaking worth it. Please let me know if any of y&#39;all have tried this, or if any of you try it, how the pain changes.
</p>

What kind of lidocaine cream were you using before? I&#39;m going in Friday and will try it with OTC cream and I&#39;m definitely scared after reading your experience!

I would try to get your hands on a prescription cream if at all possible, didn&#39;t try it so don&#39;t now how good they work, either a BLT cream, EMLA cream, or just higher percent lidocaine cream. I do have a higher sensitivity to pain I THINK? But I just picked up the walgreens pain relieving cream 4% lidocaine before my appt, put it on 30 min before and covered it with plastic wrap to help absorption. My first appt was more testing my pain tolerance than anything else. I felt like prescription creams wouldn&#39;t be enough after my experience w/ OTC so I just jumped straight to lidocaine injections.

Thanks for the reply. I don&#39;t have convenient access to lidocaine injections, that&#39;s why I asked. I have had electro (face) a lot and did find that certain creams worked better. Of the 3 I&#39;ve tried, &#34;Numb 520&#34; worked the best. I&#39;m hoping to try to get EMLA from my primary care doc but I don&#39;t see her for months...

I&#39;ve heard that you can get a 10% lidocaine cream online somewhere, i think its called Numbskin Plus? Or I would try getting a telemedicine appt with any dermatologist or PCP, anyone of them could quickly write you a prescription online.
</p>
<p>
If that fails just do what you can, and it&#39;s good to test your pain tolerance too. See what you actually need. I will say DO NOT take caffeine in the morning or beforehand. I made that mistake on my first appt. It heightens your nerves and pain receptors. Take as much ibuprofen as you feel comfortable with, load up on OTC cream and go. You might be like some of the people in this thread with godly pain tolerance, who knows? And you are always in control. If you can&#39;t handle it, just say i&#39;m done. It&#39;s not a contest. I quit at 45 min, you could go all the way or you could just say im done at 20 minutes. Go as long as you can though, bc it does get slightly better after the first 20 min. My electrologist was rather generous and only charged me for the 45 min even though i was scheduled for an hour, which was pretty awesome!

It is
<a href="https://shop.skinnumbing.com/ns-blue/">here
</a>
,
<del>
but the server is acting up right now

. I ordered a couple of weeks ago and they shipped FedEx the next day for free.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve found it works very well for about a half hour at a time. I do hour sessions, so I leave half my face covered and that seems to get me through. I was using 25/5/2 Benzocaine/Lidocaine/Tetracaine prior.

Its the lidocaine that&#39;s strongest in that mix. If you could get 25% lidocaine instead of 5% it would be a whole different thing.

I tried using

once, but it didn&#39;t really seem to make any difference.
</p>
<p>
10.56% from Numbskin put down first is very &#34;creamy&#34; and seems to absorb fast while the BLT from Biosense was &#34;greasy&#34; and formed a good &#34;barrier&#34;. Maybe the Numbskin blocked the Biosense. IDK.

If you can get it compounded there&#39;s some much stronger ones in the wiki.

Yeah, but I haven&#39;t found a doctor willing to write a script. 5% seems to be the legal OTC limit, so I&#39;m happy with 10%.

That’s why it didn’t work. Emla or lidocaine cream needs to go on like cake icing and be on for at least 2 hours before it’s taken off for it to actually work. It’s such a common mistake. If my appointment is at 11, I wake up at 830 or 730 if I have a really long appointment And let it sit until 11 when my appointment starts. And the electrolysis wipes as they are working. And you don’t ever feel again. I also used the cream for a 4 hour tattoo session and was able to fall asleep.

I can see the ice helping prior. Personally I have little to no issue with process. Just did a session without any aid. It is a mind set for me, something akin to getting a tattoo.  Nothing bleeds nothing breaks so why make a big deal out it. It is something between me and my surgery. So it will not win...

Sort of agree, and that&#39;s why I think everyone should test their pain tolerance with an appt without any expensive anesthetic, b/c you don&#39;t know what you need, especially when discussing lidocaine injections, as that makes it WAY more expensive. But I don&#39;t really see why you wouldn&#39;t do free stuff to make it as painless as possible. Like ibuprofen, not having caffeine beforehand, or cheap stuff like OTC cream. Even if you can &#34;handle&#34; it, it still just makes things easier and less psychologically draining, bc pain, even small amounts wear you down. I think of electrolysis as death by a thousand cuts. A couple of slightly more painful lidocaine injections are far better than hundreds of tiny zaps. If you have an electrolysis appt before work it can just drain you.
</p>
<p>
I will say though, that you are very much outside the norm, as apparently it&#39;s pretty standard for genital electrolysis to need SOME amount of numbing. And more than an hour appointments (2-3 hours) almost always need either prescription cream or injections. I did 7 sessions of laser on the face without any numbing at all, it wasn&#39;t even CLOSE to the pain of OTC lidocaine cream electrolysis on the genitals in my personal experience.

Yeah, honestly totally understand the inconvenience of cream. Especially wrapping it in plastic and having do it 30-1 hr beforehand. I have an hour drive, so I DUNNO WHEN I WOULD DO IT lol. I did it while eating fast food nearby in my car before my pain test hour long appt.

Definitely agree, I&#39;d heard so much about how painful it was so I expected I&#39;d need lots of numbing, but it really isn&#39;t that bad. Uncomfortable, yeah, but totally tolerable.
</p>
<p>
If course, I&#39;ve also heard of people who needed a break every few minutes even with numbing, so I think it&#39;s a your mileage may vary type thing.

Have you had any facial electrolysis?  I&#39;ve done a ton of that and will be starting genital soon.  I&#39;m wondering how they compare in terms of pain, and anything else you might feel is relevant.

So I personally didn’t have an issue with the injection process personally however I’m curious to know if anyone felt like they were having a heart attack after the injections were done!? I’m told it’s common for people to feel unwell after the injections but good lord there has to be something else they can use that doesn’t make you feel like crawling up in a ball. I will however try the pre injection icing cause anything that cuts down discomfort I’m always down for. I usually ice before my Estrogen injections so it makes sense.

Ok. Whew cause I thought I was the only one. I’ve been told since that having a full stomach often helps reduce the adverse effects so I’m planning to have a good size meal before going in for my next appointment in hopes it’ll help some what.

Marie at Senza Pelo Med Spa also is really good at those injections. I can&#39;t say for genitals, but for faces, the shots are near undetectable. She&#39;s just really really good at injections.

Actually not Maria, I&#39;m with April! She&#39;s a registered nurse  so she&#39;s able to do micro injections throughout the entire procedure. Apparently Maria doesn&#39;t do long-form anymore anymore. But she did do my first appointment, one hour without lidocaine injection.

Yesterday, I had my third genital electrolysis session at Papillon Center and was warned from the beginning not to apply topical lidocaine prior due the the toxicity combination of the topical and the injections they provide. Applying the topical before can lead to a serious situation when receiving lidocaine injections.

Yup, def do not do it, heard you can get heart palpitations/die from it. Can&#39;t control how much is absorbed with cream. One or the other, either injection or cream, not both :)

Any known dangers with lidocaine injections in genital area? I go for my first treatment in January.

Just don&#39;t double up and use any numbing creams beforehand, there can be risks of lidocaine poisoning/toxicity from that combo. I would recommend icing the area beforehand to reduce pain of the injections, worked wonders for me! Lol, hour drive to my electrolysis place so I had to ice my genitals on the way LMAO.

But nah, just the generic lidocaine injection side effects and potential issues, nothing different besides location and it hurts more.
