Posted on mobile-- so sorry about the awful formatting. Here&#39;s the bulleted section in a readable format:
</p>
<p>
• Scar tissue initially felt like erectile tissue, but has largely subsided with massaging 3 months out.
<br>
• Pelvic floor therapy has been very helpful and educational post-surgery.
<br>
• Odor was initially non-present, appeared strongly at around 2 months, and after two weeks has vanished entirely. I believe this may have been due to both healing as well as changing my douching method. I use normal saline mixed with filtered water and a pump douche.
<br>
• I have been using the orange dilator with full depth. At 3 months, I am also having pleasurable penetrative sex with my (cis male) partner.
<br>
• At 6 weeks, I was able to achieve an orgasm by using a vibrator. I used a pad to dull the hypersensitivity I was still experiencing at this point in recovery. I have been able to orgasm with a vibrator regularly since.
<br>
• I had urinary retention and had my catheter re-inserted on my 3rd night in the hospital. The catheter was finally removed permanently on my 10th day post-op. After sleeping, I was able to finally urinate on my own.
<br>
• Pain post-surgery has been minimal. I did not use pain killers upon returning home and was able to climb 4 flights of stairs slowly with help without any stitches tearing. I did need chore support from friends and family for 6 weeks post-op. Having a family member present for my first week home was hugely helpful!
<br>
• Slough initially concerned me, but after treating with silver nitrate per Del Corral’s direction this resolved without issue.
<br>
• Del Corral and his staff have been true experts, and compassionate providers. I have felt completely safe in their hands throughout and have done my best to follow all his and his staff’s suggestions.
<br>
• Aesthetically, things have steadily healed and I am so over the moon with the result :)
<br>
• Self-lubrication is present but minimal, but is expected to increase in the coming months. I still use a good amount of lube for sex.
<br>
• The nurses at Medstar were exceptional.
<br>
• CareFirst BCBS covered nearly the entirety of the procedure.
<br>
• No hair removal was required, given the canal was made via colon tissue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions in the comments!

Do you know if Del Corral does sigmoid revisions?  I had a PI with Ramineni in April 2023.

I have a question: What made you choose the sigmoid colon technique over the jejunum technique?

I just felt more secure in that method given the two of them have had so much experience together on sigmoid, and the benefits for me felt similar (I don’t mind the scars from my procedure). I’m sure if I went into my consult wanting jejunum over colon, Del Corral would have provided me more extensive info on the differences.

This really struck me as well; as someone who generally really enjoys big inner labia I often find neovaginas lacking in that department. I&#39;m non-op myself, but it&#39;s good to know for my gf&#39;s sake that he makes really good inner lips

Congrats! I am a Dr. DC girl too! Had sigmoid method in May of this year, and I couldn&#39;t be happier.
</p>
<p>
I hope you got to enjoy the nurses! Sunny and Mary were my absolute favorite people!

Full-depth for me means the maximum amount of depth that I went into the surgery expecting— which in this case was about 6.5 inches. My pelvis, and by extension canal, actually curves upwards sharply after this point and I wouldn’t be able to feasibly reach more depth even if I wanted to.

This was extremely helpful to see and read, as I have my surgery scheduled with Dr. Del Corral at the end of January 2025. Please keep us updated on your progress and hopefully a 1-year update. C:

I&#39;m thinking of going in for sigmoid myself, and I&#39;ve got my consultation relatively soon. Would it be okay if I showed my doctor some of these photos (particularly Post recovery) as a point of reference during my consultation?
</p>
<p>
Edit:
</p>
<p>
Also, I have a few questions (feel free to answer or not, some of them are very personal):
</p>
<p>
-when creating the labia, do you know what tissue they used? If they use the perineum for me, I&#39;m concerned I&#39;ll need some electrolysis there (pending talking to my surgeon and electrologist)
</p>
<p>
-how long did the surgeon recommend you dilate for? I&#39;m given to understand the requirement is normal amounts for the first year, but following that, just the introitus needs dilating.
</p>
<p>
-any GI tract complications/issues following surgery? Also, did you have any pre-existing digestive issues?
</p>
<p>
-any urethral issues pre-surgery that may have caused the urine retention, or was it just a post op special
</p>
<p>
-how long did the doctor ask you to take off work? Also, what kind of work do you do? (I need to check how long to take off, but my work is low intensity and sedentary)
</p>
<p>
-I don&#39;t love how hands on the nurses had to be after my top surgery (I know it was a medical necessity, I&#39;m not complaining, I just didn&#39;t enjoy it). If you&#39;ve had any other surgeries, how would you compare the invasiveness Post op? I know this is partially down to individual nursing staff, and guidance will vary between hospitals/countries (I&#39;m UK), but just a general idea would be helpful
</p>
<p>
-did they ask you to do a soft food diet? If so, how long before/after? (I did one for my face, was mostly okay, but was more just a case of seeing what my jaw could cope with)
</p>
<p>
-did you have to be particularly emphatic to get sigmoid as a first go? I know a lot of surgeons default to PIV, and more recently, PPT, but from my research, I&#39;m fairly sure that sigmoid is the best option for me, although I&#39;m assuming I&#39;ll have to present a strong case for it (I know this varies surgeon to surgeon, atm my first choice is Dr Rashid).
</p>
<p>
Also, feel free to reply in DMs if you&#39;d prefer and you&#39;re happy to answer
</p>
<p>
Edit 2:
</p>
<p>
-I try to avoid opioids, they don&#39;t mesh well with my OCD. My face surgery didn&#39;t really give me anything but paracetamol and ibuprofen, and my top surgery had the nurses giving me a morphine button, but I refused to use it for fear of it setting off my OCD. If you&#39;ve had any other surgery done, how would you compare the pain levels while in hospital? Did they offer you opioids?

You can absolutely show some of these pictures! Thank you for asking.
</p>
<p>
I do not know what tissue was used down there specifically, but I can say that before surgery my genitals were about 4 inches flaccid, 6 inches erect and I had not been circumcised. The Dr. described me as having more than enough tissue for any procedure— hence why he made use of that tissue in creating the inner labia. I did softly push for Colon. I did not have any electrolysis or hair removal before the procedure.
</p>
<p>
Initially, I dilated twice a day for the first month. Now I dilate once a day for 30 minutes. I’ll be dilating once a day for the first six months to a year.
</p>
<p>
No notable GI issues save for difficult passing stool after surgery due to the anaesthesia. It was about 4 or 5 days until I could fully go number 2 post-surgery. I was on a low-fiber diet for the first 6ish weeks post-surgery to reduce the amount of times I went to the bathroom, ensuring my colon had all the necessary time to heal. I want to stress that recovery has been smooth for me in the grand scheme, but the procedure is certainly invasive.
</p>
<p>
I should have clarified, I have 5 small scars on my abdomen from the procedure.
</p>
<p>
No urinating issues ahead of surgery. I don’t know for sure, but I think the retention was due to swelling (I was notably swollen post-surgery, to the point where the nurses commented on it). I also want to say it was very difficult for me to try and even orient my muscles to urinate— everything felt new to me. It felt like I didn’t know where to push or how to get the urine out, which had me worried. Everything was normal, however, and it did resolve after 10 days. Now I urinate normally and it’s incredibly mundane yet affirming.
</p>
<p>
Doctor asked for 12 weeks. I took about 8.5 weeks off. I do Motion Design— a lot of computer stuff and some commuting.
</p>
<p>
Certainly it has been the most invasive surgery I’ve had. Expect nurses to assist you with your first dilation, remove your catheter, help you douche for the first time, etc. I would highly recommend having a loved one with you your first week or two post-op. I had my Mom and pretty quickly we got comfortable with me not wearing anything below. It helped for her and for me, given airflow can be really helpful after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I did emphasize to him that I preferred sigmoid and wanted to pursue that option. He detailed the other approaches as well as sigmoid. I told him that I wanted to keep my hair, have the capacity to self-lubricate, and have the flexibility and durability of a colon-made canal. He did not push against this and understood, mentioning with hair removal I could have chosen whichever option I wanted given I was relatively young and healthy with enough tissue to work with.
</p>
<p>
Regarding opioids, I used some in the hospital (Oxy and one other, the name is escaping me but it was liquid). At home, I didn’t use any opioids or painkillers at all. Aside from the discomfort of the catheter still being in me, pain was minimal.

Thanks for the detailed response, I&#39;m glad to hear it with electrolysis, I really want to avoid that myself. My face has been a battle, and I&#39;m only approaching half way, so I&#39;m dreading anything near my groin if it comes to it.
</p>
<p>
That sounds about the right timeline for Post anaesthetic no2, I had the same thing with my last surgery, and they wouldn&#39;t let me leave until I&#39;d definitely been, ended up stuffed to the gills on laxatives and stool softeners for like 4 days. That&#39;s good to hear though.
</p>
<p>
As for scarring, I had a diep flap for top surgery, so I already basically have a tummy tuck scar, so either they can open me up there, or add some more idc. I&#39;m turning into a bit of a patchwork doll, but it&#39;s on my bikini line, so most of my scarring is well hidden. I think eventually I might go in for a tattoo cover up/decoration. I&#39;m never going to be rid of my scars, and I&#39;m not bothered by them when they&#39;ve been for surgeries that have been life saving.

Yeah that makes sense, I can imagine that must have been a bit frightening. If you&#39;ve been catheterised before this op, how would you compare? I was catheterised after my top surgery, and it was a nightmare coming out, I think a mix of psychological and physical problems with that one. And yeah I can imagine the affirming part, it&#39;s always the little things. I&#39;m most excited to get back to sports without having to tuck, like holy shit the self consciousness is just not fun, and I don&#39;t love feeling like I&#39;m being off-putting. Not to mention, my local airsofting place doesn&#39;t have the best facilities for women, like I get that plumbing isn&#39;t easy in the middle of nowhere, but the crack in the door makes me so concerned people are going to be able to see in and that&#39;ll out me.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s handy to know with time off. My work has been very helpful, but I&#39;ve already squeezed two surgeries in this year, so I&#39;m a bit apprehensive about asking for that long post surgery for next year. Do you work from home at all? I guess I could use my personal leave in there too if it comes down to it, but it&#39;ll be a rough year. With top surgery, I was advised to take a month if not longer, but managed on two weeks returning remotely. It was exhausting but I was concerned about asking for too much.
</p>
<p>
Not gonna have a fun time with that I guess, but thanks for sharing, at least I know what to prep for mentally. Better than going in blind. After surgery, how long are things numb for? I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d find it worse being able to feel everything, or having it be numb really.
</p>
<p>
As for loved ones, depending on my partner&#39;s schedule, I know I&#39;ll at least get visits, so that works, did you have friends come visit you at all? I know that helped me a lot last time.
</p>
<p>
Your doc sounds good too, how did you find his bedside manner? (Really just curious because my insurance only covers UK docs, and I can&#39;t afford this out of pocket, also documentation purposes for anyone else reading in future I guess, internet is forever etc). Did he stick around/visit much? My top surgery doc was in and out with my surgery, so it helped that she was very friendly.
</p>
<p>
Wrt opioids, were you given the option, or was it a case of &#34;if you don&#39;t have these on a drip, you are going to be screaming and waking up everyone in the ICU&#34; my pain tolerance is weird (I can be very sensitive, but then my capacity to grit my teeth and get through something goes way up if I believe I have no other option and I can psych myself up enough e.g. electrolysis, avoiding morphine after top surgery)
</p>
<p>
Also, another question, clothes post op. My understanding of it is that the first 6 months or so, consider all underwear fundamentally disposable, and stock up on pads. After that, you&#39;re free to do whatever. Does that sound about right or is there more to it? Like if I wore jeans that were tight around the crotch after 6 months, would I be wincing with every step (I know mileage varies) or is that doable?

Part of the reason I wanted to share these was because, for a lot of us, we’re not going to get great looking results right away. I had a small open wound on my inner labia post-surgery that needed time to resolve and heal. Learning how common slough was was really helpful in this respect... I was so worried of a serious complication. I just had to be patient. I’m certain my surgeon could see ‘the final result’ in his mind long before I could. I just did his recommended wound care and tried to stay positive and it all worked out. He did a wonderful job :)

I wouldn’t know, personally. I’ve never heard of someone having that much depth with SRS.

I have seen many results obtained this depth by means of a steel technique called Sigma-Lead
