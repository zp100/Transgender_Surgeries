...and now I really regret it :(
</p>
<p>
I had surgery with Dr. Suporn, and he offered to give me 6&#34;. The reason for 6 and not 7 like he usually guarantees is because I have Crohn&#39;s Disease and I guess he just wanted to take precautions, so one less inch of depth from 7 would be good enough. But for some reason I thought that maybe I should go even lower, so I asked him to give me 5&#34; instead.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really sad about it, even though its &#39;just&#39; one inch, I think it makes a big difference in the way it feels though... I know it can be a lot worse though... It just frustates me even more that I know its my own dumb fault.
</p>
<p>
Am I stuck with only 5&#34; inches forever? Is there anything I can do to increase depth? I tried pushing hard but it gets uncomfortable and I can only do it for like 5 min at a time, and it only stretches like 1 cm maybe 2.  Also I asked them in email if I can increase depth by putting pressure on it and they recommended I do not do that because I could cause damage.
</p>
<p>
Does there exist a surgery that can safely increase depth? I tried researching but I didn&#39;t find anything, I just read that with the PPT technique you can&#39;t change it, but you may be able to increase depth of PI technique, although I read Suporn&#39;s technique is non-penile inversion, so I don&#39;t know what the case is for me.

fwiw, a lot of people with a ton of depth report that it doesn&#39;t feel as good because partners can&#39;t hit the back wall, 5&#34; is probably great

5 inches is a lot. You can increase depth with dilation over time though.
</p>
<p>
If you want to go the surgical route, several surgeons offer depth revisions. You would need to look at their websites and contact their offices to see what they can offer you and if they would revise another surgeon&#39;s work or not. Some will, some won&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
To my knowledge Dr. Wittenberg offers the PPT technique as an option for a depth revision, if you are set on that method. Not sure how she feels about revising other surgeons&#39; work tho.

Ya, 5 is not bad i know.. I can live with it but it&#39;s frustrating knowing that I screwed myself out of getting 6+ üòî
</p>
<p>
Well that is very comforting to know a revision is possible.

8 years post op and many intense hours not revolving around dilation in particular I gained maybe one inch.

I tried dilating for 30min every day for a few months making sure to put a lot of pressure at the back and it did nothing but make me raw inside and even more prone to infections. It got to a point where dilating started to become excruciating because I had damaged the end so much. And through all of that, what did I gain? Nothing. Now I&#39;m down 3cm from my original depth and there&#39;s very little I can do about it. Just keep to the dilation schedule so that you don&#39;t lose any.

I really recommend against the advice to try for more depth than you got from surgery. The idea of taking heaps of painkillers and then just forcing things seems like a recipe for ripping something, or puncturing something, or whatever else.
</p>
<p>
There are definitely surgeries to increase depth. There are surgeons who do revision surgeries which include adding depth through a few different techniques, you&#39;ll have to do some extensive research to find all the options, but here&#39;s just one from a fairly well known surgeon:

(it&#39;s been a good cope for me, I had 7&#34; but now just over 5&#34; because life has its way. I&#39;m still gonna try get some back cuz i had it before and figure it&#39;s fairly safe to do so, but that&#39;s not the situation you&#39;re in)

Hey I may have crohn&#39;s disease and want SRS
</p>
<p>
What meds did you take for crohn&#39;s before and after surgery?
</p>
<p>
And couldn&#39;t being on an immunosuppressive med after surgery increase infection rate indefinitely since technically the vagina is an open wound?

hey!
</p>
<p>
2 years ago I was on remicade, but I only took it for like 6 months and I stopped because I wanted to try a different approach and treat my crohn&#39;s with diet alone, so I went with a ketogenic diet and that worked for me.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not currently taking any medication either and am still in remission..
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think I know the answer to that one, but I think there are definitely post op trans girls that have crohn&#39;s and are taking remicade or other crohn&#39;s medications still, without infection.

I don&#39;t wanna push as hard as I can, that scares me too much!

For cis women their vaginas can stretch a lot more though :/

I read that it can hurt too.. but I also read that usually it expands when aroused for cis women.
</p>
<p>
Well I can definitely live with what I got, it doesn&#39;t feel like I absolutely need more, but I would have desired more...

Hey, I know this is an old post - but I have Crohn&#39;s and I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll never get to have SRS. How have things gone so far? I can&#39;t find much information about things in general, so it would mean a lot if you could get back to me.

I wouldn&#39;t worry about that depth at all!!! The average cis vagina length is less than 4&#34;, and if worried about sex with cis penis bearers - the average is actually 5-5.5&#34;. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure 5&#34; will serve you well

Wow cool.. I&#39;m not sure if I can keep pressure on it for 30 min, but maybe if I don&#39;t put too much pressure on it I can.

I got my surgery 7 months ago, so not too recent but it wasn&#39;t that long ago.

Good for you. Pushing your body beyond its limit with high does of painkillers sounds astronomically stupid though.

Wait a minute - did you say that you had SRS with Suporn? Was it recent? You are also speaking in inch units rather than metric, and you didn&#39;t mention being from any other country, so are you from USA? If you are from USA and you were able to get SRS with Suporn recently, how were you able to get into Thailand? I thought that Thailand and most countries in the world in general are still shut off to people from USA because the world sees our great land of freedom as some kind of Covid Central - or has it changed? Have they started allowing people from USA into Thailand for medical tourism purposes?
