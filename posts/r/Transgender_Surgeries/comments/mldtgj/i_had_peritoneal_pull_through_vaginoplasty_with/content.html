As the title says I got PPV Vaginoplasty 3 weeks ago with Dr Gallagher. Here&#39;s some of my story. It&#39;s a bit long and maybe some TMI but I don&#39;t want to leave anything out.
</p>
<p>
Last year I did my consult and set everything but insurance up because my insurance refused to do anything until this year. The first day of the year I contacted Gallagher again and gave them my stuff for my insurance again and got silence for over a month. Then it was a mad rush to get everything set up before the deadline of last month so I could actually get the surgery, with Gallagher&#39;s office lagging behind until the last second or I kept calling them until it was done. The day before the surgery I went to the hospital (Coral Gables, one of the higher end hospitals in Miami) and they handed me another bill for $3k after I already paid $14k to Gallagher that was supposed to be all my expenses for the surgery after insurance. I had to spend several hours getting the bill from Gallagher because I didn&#39;t think to take a several month old bill with me and I had to wait until 4 hours past the time the appointment was supposed to happen, but otherwise pre op went sort of normal.
</p>
<p>
The day of the surgery they got me in the waiting room, in my gown and set up, put the IV in me, and then wheeled me to the OR after a bit of a wait. I was knocked out before I even left my hospital room. I woke up afterwards drowsy and barely able to move and in a ton of pain and don&#39;t have any memory of right after the surgery other than I couldn&#39;t sit up or get up.
</p>
<p>
Day 1 after my surgery my mom came in to visit and tried to help, the nurses were nice but I could still barely move. Turns out someone forgot to turn the IV back on (why?) So I was getting dehydrated. All the nurses were waiting for the doctor to come in most of the day to ok me eating and drinking. When Gallagher did come in and say yes she was really nice and checked everything to make sure I was ok. I was barely able to eat and drink and move, I couldn&#39;t sleep and basically cried night one as I was forced to move around while they kept changing the makeshift diaper made of pads to keep blood from getting everywhere. The nurses did what they could to help and eventually gave me morphine for the pain.
</p>
<p>
Day 2 was a bit better. My appetite came back and I could move more. They got physical therapy in and I was a bit overenthusiastic and jumped right up to standing instead of sitting first since they tried to sit me on the diaper and it hurt. I almost knocked myself out and still have flashbacks to what happened then. The PT people said they&#39;d come in twice a day every day but they didn&#39;t come in later. I had to try standing on my own, mostly because I was afraid I&#39;d be unable to move anymore if I didn&#39;t, to which the nurses scolded me for putting myself in harm&#39;s way. I feel really bad about that night. I kept calling the nurse over for my meds as soon as I was able to because they&#39;d wear off after an hour so I&#39;d wake up every hour.
</p>
<p>
Day 3 in the hospital and I was able to sit up a bit but had no back muscles. It was most of the same except Gallagher came in and finally took the diaper and tape off. Gallagher said I was doing great and that I should be able to leave the next day. A PT came in and I was able to stand but not walk at the time. They said they&#39;d be back but they never came back. This is also the day that the nurses changed and the new ones were noticeably worse. They&#39;d walk in and I&#39;d tell them it was time for my pain medicine and they&#39;d just walk out without doing anything. One of them tried to argue with me to take pain meds that don&#39;t work with me instead of the morphine that did work (most pain meds just don&#39;t work for me and most of my family, idk why it&#39;s just how we are. The only alternative they gave me I tried day 2 and it didn&#39;t do anything at all) saying I was becoming addicted. That night they put these leg pads to prevent DVT on and later that night I needed them off so I could get to a better position to sleep, so I called a nurse to help instead of hurting myself trying to take them off and the nurse talked a bit about some random stuff and ran off.
</p>
<p>
On day 4 I was woken up by breakfast then before I could do anything PT came in and realized they were too early. I called them in and walked a bit and when I got back to my room they removed all the blankets and everything. I was informed I was leaving by 10 no matter what (it was 8) and that I was perfectly fine (I could barely walk the 15 steps in the hall, couldn&#39;t sit up still) and needed to leave. My mom came in, one of the nurses helped me get dressed, and I was wheelchaired out because I couldn&#39;t walk.
</p>
<p>
The next days in the hotel we&#39;re horrible, i could barely be out of the bed for 2 minutes without breathing problems and getting nauseous. I couldn&#39;t shower by myself, and had a panic attack when my mom tried to help me shower. After 2 says we went to Gallagher&#39;s office and she removed my packing and catheter and taught me how to dilate. We went home that day because my mom couldn&#39;t take being in Miami anymore (we were both born and raised there and hate the city)
</p>
<p>
Right when I got home I bloated up and it was a herculean effort to pee when I desperately needed to. Over the next couple of days it was almost uncontrollable and would take all my energy and I couldn&#39;t poop still so me and my mom panicked and I took some more laxatives to hopefully help. 3 days ago I started pooping but it was a clear white liquid and hurt and wouldn&#39;t stop. The night before last night I went to the ER and was completely dehydrated with almost no electrolytes so they helped with that and took blood tests and a CT scan. Turns out I have a kidney infection and I called Gallagher yesterday and she&#39;s thinking I might have a colon infection too, I&#39;m going to my primary today to find out.
</p>
<p>
I really don&#39;t know how to feel about this honestly. Every since my surgery it&#39;s been nothing but literal hell. I almost died several time and my pain hasn&#39;t gone away. I haven&#39;t been well enough to dilate even so now I have to work extra hard to get back to where I&#39;m supposed to be. When I&#39;m not having to deal with my infections it feels amazing down there, especially when I&#39;m dilating. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be able to start living a normal life or even just processing and enjoying my new vagina.
</p>
<p>
These problems im going through are definitely not the fault of Gallagher, she&#39;s been doing what she can to help. Some of these things just happen sometimes.
</p>
<p>
Edit: it&#39;s been 3 weeks. Time is so weird right now.

I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve had such a rough time with this. But I&#39;m glad you caught the kidney infection early. I had one last month and ended up septic and in the ER for 4 days because I didn&#39;t catch mine (my fault not my surgeons). But I&#39;m hoping your primary care Dr can help and get you where you need to be with recovery. Wishing you all the best!

I&#39;m really glad that you made it through that bit of a rough patch and you&#39;re safe at home. What&#39;s even better to hear is that you have access to aftercare to help with the unexpected baggage you came home with.
</p>
<p>
Was that panic attack the first one you have ever had? I only ask because I had my first and only panic attack 3 days after surgery with Gallagher. In fact, as I read your story I was actually shocked that 4-years after my GRS with Gallagher, other patients would continue to  suffer under same poorly coordinated and attended surgery experience. You should feel very fortunate right now that all of your incisions haven&#39;t dehisced and you can actually pee. Four-years after my surgery with Sweet Dr. Gallagher, I have to take medications, daily, just to control my urinary functions. So thumbs up for you on that note. Win!
</p>
<p>
I know you are only 3 weeks out and you said you don&#39;t know how to feel about everything that happened as of yet -- but let me pose a simple question. From the last minute communication silence to the rushed scheduling, the hospital payment snafu, the IV mishap, the pain med issue, the PT no shows, the sudden dismissal, the horrible days in the hotel, the bloating, a kidney and possible colon infection and a trip to the ER and a CT scan as a result of dehydration, all wrapped up with this post-surgery gem:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#34;Every since my surgery it&#39;s been nothing but literal hell. I almost died several time and my pain hasn&#39;t gone away. &#34;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>
So remind me, whose care were you under?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Look I get it, I get it, you don&#39;t want to poke the bear because she might read this and take offense. That&#39;s totally normal. Since I can read and I don&#39;t mind calling her out on this abysmal treatment, because she let similar things happen to me. It wasn&#39;t normal then and it shouldn&#39;t be normal now.
</p>
<p>
None of what you describe should be normalized with excuses or because we were charmed by an Irish accent. The idea that &#34;Some of these things just happen sometimes&#34; is bonafide
<strong>
gaslighting.
</strong>
Sure, some things just happen, but what you describe is excessive by any measure. I&#39;m telling you this from my experience with many surgeries and surgeons including Dr. Gallagher. This is the kind of event that can traumatize people.
</p>
<p>
You still have a way to go with your recovery. I hope you are resting and taking it easy and avoiding any further infections. Complications can and do happen when you least expect them so it&#39;s important you give yourself the time and space to heal. I could throw in my own SPOILERS as to what the future may hold for you, but I won&#39;t poison the well with needless stress. You deserve the GRS of your dreams and I hope you get it in the end.

So the colon infection I got is actually really common with invasive surgeries due to the requirement to take antibiotics afterwards during recovery. The IV and treatment during my hospital was all the hospital nurses and the doctor that was treating me at the hospital, which wasn&#39;t Gallagher.
</p>
<p>
I will say Gallagher rushed me out of the hospital and rushed to take the catheter out early. She&#39;s definitely reckless.
</p>
<p>
However, I&#39;m recovering nicely after talking her suggestions and everything is lining up and functioning well. I can feel inside and even dilate, though I can&#39;t dilate as well because I wasn&#39;t able to dilate for the first week or so I had my catheter out. I would&#39;ve gotten better and faster care if I had stayed in Miami but I couldn&#39;t drive and my mom could so she forced me to go 3 hours away from my surgeon right after getting my catheter taken out.
</p>
<p>
I understand you&#39;ve had a bad experience and I have too, but I&#39;d rather not just burn every surgeon at the stake for matters outside their control. I can pee and poop fine and am really sensitive down there even now in the middle of the early stages of recovery (the glue and stitches they used still haven&#39;t come out) and my primary even looked and said everything looked ok.
</p>
<p>
Gallagher may have her faults but the alternative is literally a butcher who puts people in a motel right after surgery and has only been practicing for a year. She didn&#39;t &#34;win me with the Irish accent&#34; I&#39;m part Irish myself and one of my partners is, I chose her because she knew what she was doing and wasn&#39;t an asshole cis man that thinks women can&#39;t have pleasure and trans healthcare can&#39;t progress.
</p>
<p>
EDIT:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not at all. I have a dissociative disorder, panic disorder, major depression, an anxiety disorder, and PTSD. I realized halfway through I was having flashbacks and a panic attack and my mom realized what was going on because it&#39;s happened before around her.

Yes, she is reckless. She left me with permanent nerve damaged and very little sensation. But that is just the tip of the iceberg of what she did to me. Like I said in my reply, there are levels of acceptable unknowns with surgery, that&#39;s a given. I commented on yours, because I recognised a host of similar problems, not because we are outliers. You&#39;re still an unknow in terms of outcome, but I&#39;m absolutely not an isolated surgery incident suffering from GRS and revision complications due to the very same pattern of recklessness you described. As much as I hate to see anyone have to go through her buckshot approach to surgery, she is still embracing it.
</p>
<p>
I think you wrote an honest post about your experience. I&#39;m not trying to to put words in your mouth but she obviously doesn&#39;t have enough control over her recovery environment. You didn&#39;t need to go through all of that unpleasantness, especially while you were fresh out of GRS in the hospital. Did Gallagher actually show up to tell you that you were dismissed? All I got from her was a phone call at 8:00am telling me she had already dismissed me and I had to leave.
</p>
<p>
I was once where you are now and gleefully hinged on every word Dr. Gallagher spoke. For a year I gave her the benefit of the doubt even as my surgery fell apart because I trusted and believed in her. In the end, I was the one who got burned at the stake, not Dr. Gallagher. Four-years later, I&#39;m still trying to piece my life back together, revision by revision by revision. All she did was make recovery even more difficult every step of the way.
</p>
<p>
So you leave a smart laundry list of things people need to keep in mind when or if they consider her for surgery. I am sure, like me, you don&#39;t want to see other people fight the same demons or get cornered with last second additional expenses just to get through surgery.

She was the only surgeon close to me that wasn&#39;t a threat to my health.
</p>
<p>
She&#39;s actually really good, the issues were mainly from hospital staff and an infection, which are super common with invasive surgeries.

Yeah I had a consult with Gallagher but decided not to go with her because of her office communication issues I could never get a response from them so I worried if something did happened how long it would take them to respond

I looked at Wittenberg and was going to do a consult with her. However it would&#39;ve cost way more than I could&#39;ve afforded to fly over to have it done with her.

<p>
I wish I wasn&#39;t stuck in Florida, this state&#39;s going to be the death of me.
