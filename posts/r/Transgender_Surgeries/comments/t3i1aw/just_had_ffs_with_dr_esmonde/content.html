Just had meaning on Friday, that is. It went super well from what he said, and honestly recovery hasnâ€™t been bad so far - I did forehead and chin, and while Iâ€™m definitely having a lot of chin swelling, my forehead isnâ€™t bad at all right now.

My lower lip was

at first, though thatâ€™s gone down a lot!

Canâ€™t wait to see pics. I get mine in Dec, 2023 from Dr. Esmonde. Are you having a second FFS?

Are you able to share any photo updates? Dr. Esmonde is unable to show his previous work since leaving Meltzer clinic. Us girls who have consults know heâ€™s good but thereâ€™s nothing about his work to be found

If you have any suggestions what I can use to host a picture to link to, Iâ€™m happy to do it - I donâ€™t really use Reddit so I dunno how anything works here

I believe you can send it through DM. Or if you felt like you would want to make an new update post and add the photo in the body of the text that would work. I use mobile Reddit so I only know how to post that stuff via mobile. I usually would just add a photo from my camera roll to the body of text.

Iâ€™ve had a consult with him now, since the Meltzer clinic shut down heâ€™s unable to show any previous work that he did during that time so heâ€™s building a portfolio but itâ€™s not his top priority. Heâ€™s very intelligent, has decades of experience, amazing bedside manner, and genuinely cares for the safety and satisfaction of his patients. Seems like a great surgeon to go with!

congrats on your surgery, i&#39;m getting FFS with esmonde in the next half year and would love to see your photos! I got SRS with him this year and it went really well.
</p>
<p>
what kind of chin surgery did you get? he&#39;s recommended sliding genioplasty for me and i&#39;m a little intimidated by the recovery and risks etc but having your perspective would really help!

I had sliding genioplasty! Itâ€™s been six months now, and I am incredibly happy with the results.

I got this a little more than a month ago, so i might as well answer my own question.
</p>
<p>
Honestly the recovery was fine overall. The bone rearrangement in my chin didn&#39;t hurt nearly as much as I feared. More of a dull ache than anything. I took opiates for about a week and then i could pretty much handle it using non narcotic pain control once or twice a day. The mouth incisions were more annoying, specifically how much they limited my ability to chew easily for a couple weeks. Small bites and soft foods would have helped a lot with this but I bulled ahead more quickly than I should have. There was a weird sharp intense nerve pain on one side of my mouth, in my lip region, that persisted for more than 3 weeks but I applied  topical St Johns Wort oil on the outside and inside of my lip and it worked SO SO SO well. Soothed the pain in a matter of moments and then made the entire issue go away in a few days of repeated applications.
