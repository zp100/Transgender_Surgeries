Here is mine timeline: Dec 2021:  - sent over authorization forms for SRS consultation. Requested earliest date possible. - Align replied within 48 hrs, confirm consultation in Jan 2022 - 3 days after consultation (Jan 31st 2022), Administrative Medical Assistant replied asking for recommendation letters. - Feb 2nd 2022: + Align gave me surg date in March 2022. I said Yes! I‚Äôll take it. + 48 hours later Align replied ‚Äúmy bad, error! It‚Äôs gonna be May 2022‚Äù and to which I replied: no problem! I‚Äôll take it. + 24 hours later they said ‚Äúpsych! Lol it‚Äôs gonna be July 2022‚Äù I then again said: ok please! *sigh
</p>
<p>
So yes! Less than a year. However, many girlies are going to them nowadays. They are super busy atm which could means good things and bad things for the practice.  Lmk if you have any questions!

Any special advice when doing the consultation?  Can you share the process for getting the letters?  Was it difficult? Take a long time?
</p>
<p>
Did Dr. Satterwhite perform your surgery?
</p>
<p>
Are you satisfied with the results?
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the help!

-Align advice you to watch the consultation YouTube video by Satterwhite prior to the actual consultation with Satterwhite. Even then, he will just be repeating points from the video. He was 45 minutes late to the consultation. -recommendation letters were prepared prior to surgery as well (3-6 months). I worked with 1 out of network therapist that only met with me 2 sessions (1 hour each session). I work with another therapist for 6 months bc that was his process. Talk to your primary care doctor. Express your feeling that you need the surgery done asap. Tell the therapists you work with you need it asap. No it was not difficult. When it comes to working with insurance, it is lengthy.  -my surgery was done with Satterwhite.  -I‚Äôm content with my surgery. I asked for maximum depth and expected skinkraft. I did not get that. My depth was about 4.5 inches. My experience with Align was a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. Satterwhite was late to the consultation. I did not meet him until the day of the surgery. Just a brief ‚Äúhello, good morning, I want maximum depth, please!‚Äù. Waking up from surgery, he came by twice for less than 5 min each. Never seen him since and I have 6 in office follow up appointment. I only met with his Physician Assistance after surgery.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm about two months out and can‚Äôt not wait to explore my body. I happy now that I have a vagina. Not particularly that Satterwhite did the surgery. Honestly, I only go to him bc my he accept my insurance.
