I have my one year follow up and seemed appropriate to update. Everything works great. I can orgasm and have no issues peeing. I&#39;ve had one mild UTI. Depth is mostly the same.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a chance I want a revision for my scarring from the dehiscence, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth the risk. I&#39;ll think about it and raise it again with bluebond when I see her next.
</p>
<p>
Nothing has changed regarding my decision -- absolutely no regrets I did it. Love Bluebond and Zhao and the team, and life is much more comfortable now. The NYU-run post-op support group is full of a bunch of lovely people that have enriched my life. Going through recovery (and a big ol hematoma) without any painkillers really opened my eyes to a new end of the pain scale, and even still. 100% would do it again. Happy to answer any questions.

Did your scar care change throughout recovery or was it pretty much just the products you listed in the week 5 post?
</p>
<p>
Are there any things you&#39;d do different in your recovery? Or additional tips to pass along?
</p>
<p>
Scar Away, increase protein, Vitamin C, fish oil, collagen, probiotic, and a multivitamin supplement, right?

Yep that&#39;s it! Scar away I think is the big one. Along with scar massage. I got some Amazon massage oil and just did it after dilating.
</p>
<p>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I would do differently during recovery. Stuff I did find very valuable during immediate recovery:
</p>
<p>
Being in a place where I could walk around easily. We were close to the water so I just walked up and down that most days.
</p>
<p>
Videos. I didn&#39;t have reading books or playing video games in me at all, but I did watch a ton of sex lives of college girls and below deck. I thought I&#39;d be more able to read or play video games, and I ended up not doing either at all.
</p>
<p>
For medium term recovery, I ended up using my bum cushion that they give you more than I expected. I put it in the little purple NYU tote they give you and just sat on the bag a lot. On trains, planes, at movies, at weddings, everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Once I felt good enough to be able to start doing yoga and working out again, things felt a lot better. Both being more comfortable in my body (with tight fitting clothing) and also being active really did wonders for me.
</p>
<p>
I think I went into surgery in a pretty good place mentally, and it was still really hard. Surgery effectively makes you act depressed (need to limit physical activity, sleep a lot, can&#39;t go out much because you&#39;re constantly dilating). I really wouldn&#39;t underestimate the toll it can take. I had a rougher go of it than many will have because of my complications, but it&#39;s a risk for anyone. Definitely pay attention to your mental state before and plan out how you&#39;ll take care of yourself after. The (wonderful) social worker will go over this with you, and I&#39;d definitely take it seriously.

Your results look amazing. ‚ò∫Ô∏è You may have mentioned this in your other posts you linked or perhaps even other ones, but what was was the pre-surgery requirements like? I know I am weighing things that include possible results, pre and post-surgery requirements to consider if it is worth it with my bottom dysphoria not being &#34;the worst.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I do really appreciate you sharing your results here and potentially answering any questions. Thank you! üòä

They send you a template for hair removal. I did a cycle of laser then electro to clean up the rest. It&#39;s not great but it&#39;s not the worst. Other than that there aren&#39;t any pre op requirements, and I think theirs are similar to most people.
</p>
<p>
For me I spend a lot of time in athletic settings and was always self conscious about what was showing or not showing. Just having that totally removed was worth, even if I didn&#39;t hate my natal equipment. Happy to answer other questions if it&#39;s helpful. One thing I would recommend is if you think it might be an option is to get on the wait list now. You can always cancel it. I waited until I was 100% sure I wanted surgery and I wish I had at least called to get on the schedule sooner. They book out pretty far and I think it&#39;s only gotten worse.
