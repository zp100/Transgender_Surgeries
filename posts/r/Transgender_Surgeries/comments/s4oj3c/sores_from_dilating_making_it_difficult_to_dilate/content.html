Hi everyone! I’m 9 weeks post op MTF SRS and am having some issues. I have these sores right at the vaginal opening that are making it exceptionally painful to dilate and as a result I’ve stopped using the orange dilator because it just was too much pressure right on them. I’ve contacted the doctor but don’t expect an answer right away.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else gone through this?

That’s hypergranulation tissue. It could heal on its own or you could put Medihoney on it to speed up the healing. Other people get silver nitrate treatments.

I wouldn’t risk putting steroid cream on it, I got a prescription of that and it made things worse. So if they offer you a steroid cream then be cautious.

I hope you don’t mind me chiming in but can you just put the medihoney on your granulation tissue and leave it like you can with steroid cream? I read in some places that you need to use a bandage/dressing after you apply it.

I never did a dressing, I just put a pad and panties. It’s in such a hard to bandage spot and the medihoney will not damage surrounding tissue so it’s fine if it gets kinda messy.

Oh really? It just got bigger/more painful? I think my doctor mentioned she could prescribe a steroid.

It can damage the surrounding tissue and make your scars worse. You look really healed, I personally think medihoney fixed my problem. It doesn’t damage surrounding tissue and it speeds up healing. I honestly can’t say enough about how good it is. Steroid creams are a hit and miss.

Oh interesting thanks for that info. Can I ask what steroid you were given so I can be sure to ask the doctor if she wants to prescribe that one?

Thats hyper granulation lovely. Make a Dr appointment asap to fix her up with some silver nitrate, 2-4 days later it&#39;ll be like it never existed. Back to the orange monster in no time P.s silver nitrate hurts but literally only for a few seconds. If they have a pain cream to put on after GET IT

I think most walk in clinics have silver nitrate. Hyper granulation in that area is super common in post-Partum patients

Silver nitrate is not a panacia for granulation. It cauterizes the wound and creates scar tissue. If you keep using it in and around the same area, you&#39;ll reduce the skin elasticity. Repeat this too many times and you&#39;ll end up having to have all that scar tissue surgical removed.
</p>
<p>
If you think it&#39;s a little sore now, it can be much worse. Much much worse.

Omg that sounds horrific. I’m seeing a pelvic floor doc in a week but I’m not sure what else I can do except try to push past this. I think this wouldn’t be so bad but I stopped taking ibuprofen which helps reduce the swelling because I’m having a BA in a week. Once that’s over hopefully I can restart the meds and the granulation won’t hurt as bad.

was horrific. I went to a Pelvic floor PT and the granulation had gotten so bad all able could do was try and keep my vulva entrance open. It hurt as you might imagine based on the images.
</p>
<p>
By the time the revision rolled. Around at 7 month, most of the granulation had healed, it I was lucky to get a finger in.
