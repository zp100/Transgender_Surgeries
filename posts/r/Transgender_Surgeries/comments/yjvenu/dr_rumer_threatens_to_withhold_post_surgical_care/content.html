The trans community needs to unite behind her victims in a class action malpractice and conspiracy lawsuit. I say conspiracy due to her political ties. It’s so evident that there is motive behind what she is doing and how she treats her patients.

This, we need collective action! We need to hold the Mazzoni Center, Alexis Lake (A therapist whom Rumer is facebook friends with who proactively refers patients to her), Marci Bowers (President of WPATH) and every special interest that enables her accountable or this will never end. We need direct action since our cries have fallen upon death ears of the people in power who are supposed to protect us. Name names, and put public pressure on these people.

Daily protests at those clinics on the sidewalk sound like a great start. The trans community owes itself advocating for some baseline standards to be upheld by medical professionals, and I think all too often we are taken for granted as if we should just accept whatever parody of “care” these psychopaths out there will provide. Not everyone can go to NY, Thailand, or Europe. That doesn’t mean we deserve to be stripped of our basic human rights and self respect by people who would rather want us dead.

If there’s a silver lining it’s that this is pretty clear evidence of malpractice. Hopefully she’ll lose her license soon

IANAL but Unfortunately probably not legal evidence in a court of law as PA is a two party consent state and it doesn&#39;t sound like she was aware of the recording.

Hi, I’m sorry this happened. It’s absolutely disgusting and I hope you have reported this to the medical board.
</p>
<p>
I just want to make you aware that Pennsylvania is a two party consent state for audio recordings. Everyone being recorded must consent to it (or be in a public place without a reasonable expectation of privacy, like a park or coffee shop). Making this recording (if she didn’t consent) was a felony offense and is punishable by up to 7 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. It cannot be used by the medical board or in court. I strongly recommend removing it before she finds the recording an reports it to the police or sues you, which both sound like ways she’d try to pressure you into removing the review. A transcript is fine to post and share with the medical board, but not the actual recording.
</p>

I think the main reasons are the quick turn around time (most places are scheduling surgeries over half a year or more out, where Rumer is promising a 3 month turn around), and the fact that she accepts Medicaid. I almost went with her and even had a top surgery date and it took a friend of mine who had gone to her a few months before to convince me that I should cancel it and suck it up and wait longer. I get it - dysphoria is such a killer and it can feel impossible to wait 6 months to year or more, and even longer for those who can’t pay out of pocket and don’t have private insurance. We as a community do need to key the word out other as much as we possibly can to help protect our own. :(

This is one of the most unethical, super fucked up things I&#39;ve heard in 25+ years working in the medical field. She really needs to answer for this with her licensing board. She is straight up holding your health and wellbeing hostage.

Back in February, I sucked it up and scheduled my year review since I was still waiting for phone call with my revision date (which NEVER came as promised). We made the appointment for early June. Okay, so it’s more like a 13month review. June 7th comes and I arrive early for my scheduled appointment. As I walk through the door, the office receptionist seemed surprised to see me. I mentioned how we scheduled this appointment over three months ago. Fingers fly on the receptionists keyboard and then I hear.
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Rumer does not want to see you...... Something about a review”.
</p>
<p>
“What about it?” I reply.
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Rumer said it was nasty and she will only see me if I take it down”.
</p>
<p>
I was stunned. Literally in shock. Still in complete and total disbelief I send off an email
</p>
<p>
..................
</p>
<p>
&#34;Good day.
</p>
<p>
I did not come to today to discuss what had transpired in the past. I came today as part of the required post surgical exams. Prior to today, I didn’t receive a 6month review due to our “shortened” appointment. I only wanted to make sure things are healing.
</p>
<p>
Kathy, If you are so unhappy about the words I wrote in a review, where was the attempt to communicate with me prior to today? You don’t hold someone’s appointment hostage because your feelings are hurt. This appointment was booked almost four months ago. I didn’t want to schedule it, but I did because no matter what, it’s what is supposed to be done as a part of the process.
</p>
<p>
If I can rise above my hurt feelings, so can you.
</p>
<p>
Thank you anyway for what you’ve done for me.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes.&#34;
</p>
<p>
...........
</p>
<p>
On Monday I receive a phone call.
</p>
<p>
KR: I’d like to keep treating you, but the online review is a conflict for me and it makes it difficult to treat you.
</p>
<p>
me: Why is that?
</p>
<p>
KR: I just don’t feel that it’s helpful to anyone and I think it’s hurtful to our professional relationship.
</p>
<p>
Me: I see.
</p>
<p>
KR: So, if you want to take it down I’ll continue to treat you. Otherwise I’ll have to release you and refer you to someone else.
</p>
<p>
Me: Is that all? (I was hoping for her to actually talk about my review and how she hurt me)
</p>
<p>
KR: That is it.
</p>
<p>
Me: alright Thank you and enjoy the rest of your afternoon.
</p>
<p>
KR: Okay. Do you have a decision. Or?
</p>
<p>
Me: Thank you.
</p>
<p>
Again. Stunned. I had hoped she’d have an actual conversation but that didn’t seem to be the case. This time a letter was in order.
</p>
<p>
..............
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rumer.
</p>
<p>
Let me make this perfectly clear. I do not appreciate having my medical care held hostage because of your hurt feelings. Your call today, was nothing more than an attempt to strong arm me into taking down a review critical of your care. Instead of showing any interest in repairing the relationship, you chose to worry ONLY about your reputation. Because of this I do not feel I could trust you to provide me with the proper care I currently require. In addition, I will not be removing my review. They are my words and they clearly speak of my relationship with you and your practice.
</p>
<p>
As of today I no longer require your services.
</p>
<p>
.........
</p>
<p>
Whether or not she was actually going to follow through with my revision (with or without the review) is anyone’s guess. Should have figured she’d never apologize. People like that never do. She got her money. In closing, I am still in need of a revision. My questions were never answered, requests for other paid worn left unanswered, and a treatment no one deserves. Compassion goes a long way. Especially when it major surgery. For me, Dr. Rumer was my only logistical option. To everyone else. Buyer beware.
