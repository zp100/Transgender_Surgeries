I know you were tested for BV recently but the smelly discharge and increasing pain very much sounds like what happened to me when I had an escalating infection. In your position I would contact your primary care physician immediately about your symptoms or visit some form of emergency or urgent care. Waiting through the weekend could be bad.
</p>
<p>
As for pain you can take ibuprofen and acetaminophen together and ask your doctor about a lidocaine gel to go on your dilator with your lube when dilating.

I&#39;m so sorry. I likewise dealt with them, and had a rough time with very severe gaslighting.
</p>
<p>
The discharge may be from an insufficient micriobiome, and the subsequent dilation pain from not just granulation, but restricting internal scarring that&#39;s causing tightness in the tissue.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m dealing with a scar issue myself that resulted in a minor hemorrhage recently (lost half a pint of blood)
</p>
<p>
For the biome, I&#39;d personally recommend a water based mildly acidic lube (good clean love), as it inhibits less favorable bacteria + is easier to clean.
</p>
<p>
Yellow discharge may also be congealing serosanguinous discharge from the granulation (pretty much plasma and cell discharge from the plasma). On skin it&#39;ll crystallize, but in a most environment it can cause odor.
</p>
<p>
If they&#39;re not taking you serious, and not answering your questions, then I suggest getting a second opinion from a different hospital.
</p>
<p>
I had a severe amount of necrosis that they refused to acknowledge, with a follow-up infection. I required a full skin graft + relocation of an artery to sort of make it not look like a severe burn scar. I will never trust Ferrando&#39;s team again

Girl, I just got back from the ER.  I apparently have another ulcer and vaginal tears.
</p>
<p>
This shit is ridiculous!
</p>
<p>
On top of that, I reached out to Ferrando via the call service.  I called three times and received no phone call back.
</p>
<p>
Which doctor did you switch to? I reached out to Gupta at UH but haven’t received a call back yet.  I live in Ohio.  But I will also reach out to Chris Mcclung.
</p>
<p>
By the way regarding the same and discharge - I used boric acid suppository which completely cleared things up.  Natalie told me not to use them and just douche and dilate.
</p>
<p>
I have to play nice because she’s going my clitorial plastic in 2 weeks.

<p>
From my experience: Natalie and Ferrando don&#39;t care, and literally do not know what they&#39;re doing post-surgery.
</p>
<p>
Their entire advice follows outdated guidance, and no information from the DSM-5. Have someone from the ombudsman office chaperone your next visit, and include a list of all your questions/concerns.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Gupta is who I switched too, and his practice is far more competent

Do you wish you had your surgery with Gupta?

Just with a more trustworthy practice.
</p>
<p>
Because of their lack of empathy, dishonesty, and verbal abuse, I refuse to trust the Clinic for any future healthcare.
</p>
<p>
Ferrando violating my informed consent was just the tip of that iceberg
