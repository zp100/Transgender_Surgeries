That&#39;s one of the best results I have ever seen, not only forehead but chin and brow bone are all perfect! Congrats and you should be very happy 😊

Thank you! I think Rolfes has a really nice aesthetic and a good eye. I’m really happy I went with him.
</p>
<p>
I’m still a little swollen, esp in my lower face, but maybe it’s something only I can notice at this point—it feels like each month I look a little better, and it’s mostly apparent when viewing my face from the front (I have a couple more photos in my post history if anyone is curious)

Im told prices can really vary on a case by case basis, but Rolfes prices are very reasonable compared to the other top tier surgeons—maybe because rent in Minnesota is lower haha. My ffs lasted 6 hours and was in the 20-30k range

Thank you sooo much!! This price does seem fair, although still a bit heavy for me since I live in Europe where salaries are lower. But I&#39;m planning to do FFS in a year or so, so I will hopefully be able to save some money until then.

Your hairline looks gorgeous now too!!! Did you get transplants? Or was that all from hairline lowering? My hairline looks like your before pic and it&#39;s so encouraging to see how fantastic you look after FFS!

Thank you!

No transplants, just a scalp advancement. Im really, really pleased with how it turned out. The hairline incision curves all the way down to my ears from my temples but it’s really well hidden. He did a great job knitting together those recessions—Id actually forgotten they were that extreme until I re-discovered the photo on the left

You look amazing! Thanks for the update. I’ve added Rolfes to my list for consultations because of your and so many other positive results.

And your little ones are too cute! My baby boy just turned 5 and my little one is almost 3. Time flies. Love to see other trans mamas living their best life!

Post op is HARD. I thought I was prepared going into it, but ffs really does a trick on your emotions. It’s hard to see a different face in the mirror. You slowly start to wonder if and how all the swelling could possibly resolve itself in a way that looks good/normal. I was constantly wondering if I’d made a mistake, and some days would feel sure that I had.
</p>
<p>
Honestly seeing these photos side by side is one of the first times I was like oh yeah I’m really glad I got ffs. In my mind I looked basically the same as I did before surgery, but that is absolutely not the case.
</p>
<p>
Hang in there!

Ahh! I have a question-- Did you see any significant hair loss post surgery, and, if so, how long until the loss began to cease and normal growth begin?

I saw some loss around my temples (the part I’m lifting with my hand in the photo). When I first got out of surgery that was mostly solid hair until a couple weeks post op. It’s started growing back though, which you can kind of see of you look closely—that part im exposing in the photo is covered in baby hairs

here’s a close up I just took to give you a better sense. My hair is super greasy atm—especially along my incision because I cover it with silicone gel twice a day—but that’s the area that shed some hair and it is starting to grow back

Really good. I’d seen a couple photos of his earlier work that made me a little apprehensive re scarring. In my case the incision has healed really well. l can’t even find the scars on the side of my head, and while I can still see the incision when I examine my forehead in the mirror, it doesn’t really show up in photographs. Im optimistic that it will eventually be mostly invisible (but it will be months before I’m able to tell for sure).
</p>
<p>
I think scarring can to some extent be luck of the draw, based on how your skin normally heals, how much tension is put on the incision line, how strict you are with the aftercare regimen etc.
</p>
<p>
Here are some very swollen post op photos (in order: two days, two weeks, and a month) that  show the hairline incision’s healing as wells as some of the initial shock hair loss

Thanks for answering it looks like he did a pretty good job because even in just the one month photo its pretty hard to tell there was an incision in the first place with out looking really closely.

Firstly wow, what an amazing difference, that&#39;s such a great result.
</p>
<p>
Secondly may I ask a question? The hair line adjustment surgery, did you have to use a tissue expander for a bit in advance of the surgery? Sorry I&#39;m looking at having this done.  (you don&#39;t have to answer if you don&#39;t want to)

Nope no tissue expander. Looking at these photos side by side I’m a little mystified how my surgeon found enough scalp to knit things together so well

I think my forehead is pretty much the same as it was in the picture but I haven’t actually done any comparisons
