It just already looks so nice at such an early stage in healing. Not a ton of swelling and everything looks like it is where it is supposed to be.

Congratulations. Healing process and result up to this point looks good.
</p>
<p>
Can I ask you, whats your depth and were you circumcised? Asking cause most results of Dr. Schaff the labia minora seem to go only half the way down.

Not sure yet, will check when I&#39;m out.  Around 15cm so far with the stent I&#39;d say. I&#39;ll start being a bit more aggressive with dilation. Dr Schaff was very happy with the depth during post op care. (he does it himself the first few days)  I wasn&#39;t circumsized, and was well endowed ðŸ˜… It being a two stage surgery actually relieve quite some stress from the recovery process. Now I just want it to be functional within two months. Can you actually overdo dilation?

Thanks for the answer. So no prognosis for the size of labia minora possible.  Will see what I will get from him. From the healing it looks the 2 month are possible.
</p>
<p>
A friend of me has still nerv pain after nearly 6 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Good question with the overdo of dilation. If you find an answer, let me now =D

I actually stopped opiates for a few days thinking it would maybe help the migraines, I did not notice any pain. Doctors checking the clitoris during post op care would really make me feel it. Not pleasurable yet, but definitely there. Will explore in a few weeks.  Nerve preservation was actually one of the reasons I picked Dr Schaff.

It&#39;s two-stage, right?
</p>
<p>
Q1: When does Schaff plan the 2nd surgery for aesthetics
</p>
<p>
Q2: Could you list the products used in aftercare his team recommends using? Some medicated creams for healing and the scars?

Something a little different: how was the whole process in regards to corona? Were you able to provide a negative test result? Did you have to book a hotel 10 days in advance?

I had a 5 days mandatory quarantine that I was able to break with a antigen test. I arrived 2 weeks earlier though because I wouldn&#39;t risk a closing of the borders due to the covid variants. I tested with no problem at a Potsdam hospital 3 days before surgery.

I see, and that 2 weeks earlier, what did that cost you, if I may ask? I like to have a fully detailed plan :)
</p>
<p>
not that it would matter in the end though :/

hmmm, I mean considering the overall cost that shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Did you also book an airbnb for the initial consultation? Or did you have that before the corona situation?

I found Dr Schaff to be an absolute sweetheart.  The staff at the Klinik is lovely overall. Some doctor are more agreeable than others, I felt all where competent. ðŸ˜‰ Food was alright. I&#39;m french, I must be difficult on that point.

I had some bloodloss issues and Dr Schaff delayed his departure to Munich  to be able to do a follow up on me in case this affected the surgery results (it didnt). So yeah, that&#39;s a surgeon who cares.

One other question, in 2 parts - and a fairly traditional one:  How was the pain, and how was the pain management?

I suffered from terrible migraines due to significant blood loss after the surgery. Pain down there was very moderate compared to that. I felt they were pretty liberal with the oxycodon.
