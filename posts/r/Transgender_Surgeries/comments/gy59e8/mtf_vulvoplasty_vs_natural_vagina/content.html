how close do they compare?(not that much exp with vaginas, sorry?)
<br>
if somone has pic to compare don&#39;t them that would be helpful, do not have to be irl pic&#39;s can be digital renders but real ones might look better? i dont really know but i want to know what they look like because the only pics i can find of Vulvoplasty are ones with stitches

There&#39;s a sub for this kind of stuff. [NSFW]

It doesn&#39;t seem to go against the rules so there it is.
</p>
<p>
After seeing quite a few results there are 3 things that are a dead giveaway when I would have to figure out which ones are natural and which ones not. I addressed those when talking to my surgeon as well.
</p>
<p>
There is usually quite a large gap at the top of the labia majora. Like the clitoral hood is way too wide. It&#39;s decent for me now but it took 3 revisions and me explicitly telling the surgeon to make that more narrow. Still it sticks out on a lot of results.
</p>
<p>
Then there is the firmness/density of the labia majora towards the lower end. Almost all results are a bit saggy. Like there&#39;s no fat/meat in them. It looks aged in a way. I was thinking about eventually transplanting some fat in there to make it look more natural.
</p>
<p>
And well most results lack the fourchette. It can be corrected easily. I asked my surgeon for it. He told me it would be a bit more difficult to dilate and take bigger things in but it wasn&#39;t a big deal at all. But that isn&#39;t a thing many would notice.
</p>
<p>
I would say if someone is perfectionistic and goes the extra mile with a few revisions it really starts to look good. But even then other results still fall into the natural spectrum quite easily. After the first surgery (Dr Suporn) my gyn raised an eyebrow and told me this is pretty darn good.

He made all the revisions. It was a thing that you get them for free and just have to pay for the flight and hotel.
</p>
<p>
But that was long ago and he is slowly retiring.
</p>
<p>
I did post more details about the result (no images) in my own forum that is long gone. I mean feel free to ask whatever. I take no offense in that.

He doesn&#39;t work at the same place anymore, had find someone else who gives me the prescriptions. It ended up being my regular doc.
</p>
<p>
It ain&#39;t easy to get a glimpse on it unless I have a medical problem or am sexually involved. So I might know if there&#39;s ever a reason to get it checked out.
</p>
<p>
Eh it&#39;s pretty damn good honestly. I barely ever found something close. Not perfect but eh no one is.

Yeah, its unfortunate that no one who&#39;s had multiple revisions from Suporn posts photos, but there&#39;s not many who have and its not like I&#39;d do it either.
</p>
<p>
I heard that Suporn/Bank are doing some fat transfer now, but I&#39;m not sure the extent of it.

Hm he did transfer some fat but it wasn&#39;t really enough. He didn&#39;t took it from a separate location. And well fat can go back probably need to refresh it. It isn&#39;t the worst thing as I said it just looks less youthful and it isn&#39;t visible unless you spread your legs hard. Standing to slightly spread looks still young and normal.
</p>
<p>
I would honestly like to share some photos but the whole thing about this account is to give absolutely nothing away directly identifying away. And I vehemently refuse to show myself naked to anyone except for romantic/sexual purposes. I&#39;m actually surprised people show of their results. Like do they really feel comfortable having their pussy on the internet?

Plenty of people don’t care, or would prefer to help others. You’ve seen the wiki right? There’s heaps of photos in there.

hm it is not directly identifying unless you have seen it IRL. Same with the life story. If people generally don&#39;t know shit about it.
</p>
<p>
But besides that it is hopefully understandable why many don&#39;t want to do it.

Heres wat a group of cis and trans ppl said who support each other:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/gthlqp/just_curious_im_trans_myself_will_my_so_know_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/comments/gthlqp/just_curious_im_trans_myself_will_my_so_know_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
</a>
P.S. be careful this is a very touchy topic and most trans ppl avoid discussion about it.

Np I think its really important to talk about this stuff, becaise how can we improve wat is lacking, so other trans ppl get better care, but from wat I read of the comments its mainly just smell and the feel on the inside, not so much the look, besides the scaring, but most didnt go into to much detail so it might be other bigger differences.

Vulvo or vaginoplasty?
</p>
<p>
The second one was done with a skin graft for me. They removed the hair follicle during surgery so there is no hair. For the vulvo I do have few on the outer upper side of the labia minora and a couple on the inner side of the labia majory. It ain&#39;t much at all. Easy to just pluck out.

Yeah. Well, fyi there r more than just the penal inversion technic. I&#39;m planing on have a colovaginoplasty. Its more invasive and u will have 2 or 3 small scars on ir bell from laparoscopic surgery there, but hair wont be a problem and its lubricating. It has other possible risks amd side effects, but I thought the risks were worth wat I could possibly achieve. Oh and there&#39;s more material to work with that way as well, not use any of the gentials for the vagina itself. So, everything goes to creating the vulva.

No they r different ur right. One is only the outer part of the genitalia, the vulva, and the other the inner, the vagina. So, ur only getting the labias and clitoris created. Is that rit?

There’s lot of photos in the wiki here. I’m not sure how many are no depth, but I expect they look much the same.
