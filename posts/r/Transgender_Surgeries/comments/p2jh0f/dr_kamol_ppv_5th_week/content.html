I just did my PPV with Dr. Kamol about 5 weeks ago. So far I&#39;m happy with my results despite everything is still very swollen down there, so I can&#39;t comment too much about the aesthetics yet. I&#39;ll create a throwaway account and post my pics one day, but not now, maybe some months later.
</p>
<p>
My depth was about 6 inch on the day they removed the dressings for the first time. But I lost depth quite quickly and now it&#39;s roughly 4.7 inch despite I dilate 1 hour twice everyday as instructed. Dr. K said the outer 5 cm of neovagina is created by penile inversion, and only the deeper part of the neovagina is made of peritoneum.
</p>
<p>
My neovagina is moist, just as expected for a PPV. But it doesn&#39;t get wet when I&#39;m aroused.
</p>
<p>
I noticed wound separation between my labia majora and minora by the end of 2nd week. Dr. K arranged a minor surgery to clean the dead tissue and re-suture the wound. However, the stitches ruptured again and Dr. K now told me to keep applying ointments and it&#39;ll heal itself. But so far no visible progress and it&#39;s super depressing. I understand wound dehiscence is a common complication but still...Not a fun experience. And I really hope it&#39;ll heal it self as the doctor said.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a 33-year old nonsmoker and does not have diabetes, I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing the wound to heal so slowly
</p>
<p>
Although most doctors suggest that sex and masterbation should wait for about three months post-op, I did explored myself a little bit this week and I achieved orgasm. Super fun!
</p>
<p>
Despite all this, I still think Dr.Kamol is a good surgeon,  it&#39;ll just take some time before everything&#39;s okay I guess.

If you had that depth (and if it was not swelling ) I would say you can get it back.
