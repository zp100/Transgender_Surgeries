It&#39;s been nearly 2 years since my original vaginoplasty with Dr. BÃ©langer and now I have finally gotten a revision! I had a revision done to address the issue with my urine spraying everywhere while urinating. I am very hopeful that this revision will correct this issue but I won&#39;t know for sure until I get the catheter out. I also asked Dr. BÃ©langer to touch up my labia minora to define them better but that wasn&#39;t the primary priority of this surgery. The surgery went successfully according to Dr. BÃ©langer and my experience there was as good as last time. I have to wear a catheter for a week which really sucks but I&#39;m not in much pain at least, I&#39;m not even taking Tylenol anymore. Hoping after this surgery to not need anymore. Anyways here is a picture of the result:

Yes it was since it was an issue with functionality. I told them about the issue after being post op for a year and they put in the request for funding. Took awhile to get to surgery since OHIP was slow to approve.

It looks great! Did you have narrowing of the uthera? Was that the reason you were spraying when urinating?

No, It was due to some excess tissue around my urethra that was messing up the urine stream.

Can you define &#34;spraying everywhere?&#34; I had surgery with Dr. Belanger a year ago and am experiencing something similar, peeing on the toilet seat in front of me every time, though I don&#39;t have any discomfort or anything.
</p>
<p>
Also, were your aesthetic revisions also covered by OHIP since you were already there, or did you pay out of pocket for them?

I had a similar problem to you with spray going forward but also all over my leg as well sometimes.
</p>
<p>
The aesthetic revision was included as part of the procedure with no additional cost since they had enough time covered by OHIP to do it additionally.

Awesome info! Thank you, I&#39;ll chat with the BC-equivalent of OHIP and see what I can do ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
</p>
<p>
Your results look great by the way I hope you have a smooth recovery and plenty of opportunities to hear the Quebecois nurses pronounce &#34;catheter&#34;

wow! really good to know that someone else who had Belanger also had issue with pee spraying everywhere. Mine typically runs down my leg even after wiping with tissue. I also would like a revision to have a more pronounced clitoral hood
