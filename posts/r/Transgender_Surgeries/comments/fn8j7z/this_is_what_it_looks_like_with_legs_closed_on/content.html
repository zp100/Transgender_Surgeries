This is what it looks like with legs closed. On the previous picture my legs were spread. The random scar is from my self surgery and not the doctors fault. I talked to someone in the healthcare system, and they can remove the hair inside the vagina. So I feel a little better now.

Oh my ðŸ˜¬ Suddenly your username seems much more appropriate! I can understand the inclination all too well but jesus christ woman!

Honestly I kind of think you should probably not talk about this and think about deleting this reply so you don&#39;t give any other desperate girls ideas.

Could you elaborate on this a bit more? I&#39;d like to add it to the wiki under DIY Surgery.
</p>
<p>
Also, what was the reaction of your doctors and surgeons to this? Did it cause any problems?

I don&#39;t see how the injection techniques would cause problems with SRS.

If I were you I wouldnâ€™t go to the same doctor. Hair removal might be fine with them but if they did you dirty once thereâ€™s no guarantee they wouldnâ€™t again if you got a revision.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m happy you got that reply but just want you to be as safe as possible!

I&#39;m glad you have some kind of way to get this hair out. Things look pretty good with your legs closed as well. Overall you have a much better looking pussy than I think you sometimes give yourself credit.

About the inspiration part, actually you did inspire me too. After this last message, I checked the post on detrans that someone else had mentioned, lurked a bit more, and I found the replies quite nice. Actually, I found the whole sub very positive and inspiring - trying to help people love their body, and sometimes not being afraid to say &#34;I&#39;m sorry if I was too blunt&#34; and apparently meaning that when they say something that hurt the other person.
</p>
<p>
That&#39;s a rare sight on reddit.

<p>
You and me both :) I&#39;m here for very specific reasons, and in the meantime I try to pay back all the help I received by sharing about what I know. But the level of toxicity on the trans subs is very unnerving. Here and
<a href="/r/truscum" rel="nofollow">r/truscum
</a>
are about the only place I feel free to talk (asktg and its facists mods can burn in hell)

<p>
You are already quite strong.
</p>
<p>
And don&#39;t bother about hair so much. I told you, electrocautery. Not easy, but doable. It may take more than one pass if you have several follicles.
</p>
<p>
I had a grand total of 2 hair if I remember correctly, one right next to the urethra, one at the inside fold where the labia minora start. Both have been gone for years, so I&#39;m quite sure the results are permanent
</p>
<p>
Problems have solutions. Don&#39;t stress, take it easy, and try to disconnect. The net is a bad place, full of very sad people. It is likely to affect you very badly.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, thanks a lot for being fully open and honest about your journey. It&#39;s a rare thing here, it looks like most people are trying to do a hagiograph, pretending to be happy while they aren&#39;t really. It&#39;s refreshing to be able to interact with other fully honest people.

I&#39;ve gone through surgery twice and and both times were extremely traumatizing and made me feel regretful initially and for a bit afterwards. You&#39;ve done something very dramatic to yourself, and you&#39;re seeing and feeling yourself differently. It&#39;s going to take some time to adjust, even if everything went perfectly. You&#39;d find some of my own panicking in my profile.
</p>
<p>
Things will be fine. People will see your results and treat you like a human being (lovers too). You&#39;ve come up with a plan for how to fix the mistakes you&#39;re seeing. Even without these future adjustments, your vagina looks like the same as every other vagina (as weird, haha). Perhaps remember this moment of calm, the next time you might feel anxious about everything.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully some of that is helpful?

Question- You still have hair growing inside of your neovagina at the amount that you initially stated, like &#34;covered in hair&#34; etc? Now that you&#39;ve calmed down how much would you say was actually in there? I&#39;m glad that you have hope for hair removal though, good luck.

On top of getting it removed with the methods suggested, I recommend using a female condom if you&#39;re insecure. Because that would add a layer between the neovagina and the penis in case you&#39;re worried about the hair being felt or anything like that. And obviously (general advice) only be intimate with a partner that you trust...

Nah, you&#39;re pretty and are a very sweet person. You&#39;re just in a post-major surgery trauma period. Give it honestly like 2 years to settle your feelings on the matter (major surgeries take forever to completely heal). It should be easy for you to find a kindred soul tbh.

yea they can remove the hairs inside your vagina. i can&#39;t get genital electrolysis, so my surgeon said he&#39;d do his best to scrape all the hair off, and that if perchance he missed a few hairs and they grew inside, then he&#39;d cauterize them or something. can&#39;t remember what he was going to do, but i can assure you, something can be done about the hairs.
