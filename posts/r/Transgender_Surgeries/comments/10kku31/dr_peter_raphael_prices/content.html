I currently live in the US, and I&#39;ve been really wanting to get FFS for a little while now. One option I&#39;ve often see come up as a (relatively) affordable option with high quality results is Dr. Peter Raphael in Plano, Texas. While I&#39;ve seen some bits and pieces of his pricing online, I haven&#39;t seen anything definitive as of yet, so I&#39;d like some more input from those that have had work done with him. I&#39;m mainly looking to do a rhinoplasty, mandibular angular shaving for my jaw, blepharoplasty (for the bags under my eyes), and malar fat injections. Depending on how much room there is in my budget, I&#39;d also like a tracheal shave, some lip work, chin reduction osteoplasty, and frontal bossing shaving (the last two of which I&#39;m especially undecided about), but the ones I listed in the previous sentence are the main procedures I want done. I&#39;d also like some suggestions for other surgeons, both in and out of the US, with good bang for the buck, though I&#39;m mainly looking at Dr. Raphael as of now. I want to know what I&#39;m in for, pricing-wise, so I&#39;d like as much pricing info as possible. Thanks in advance.

Or I think you can fill out a form on their website to tell them what you’re looking for.

</p>

</p>
<p>
5600.00 Type 1 brow lift + hairline (discounted from 7000.00)
</p>
<p>
5600.00 Rhinoplasty (discounted from 7000.00 )

Thank you so much! ❤
</p>
<p>
Were there any other costs you had to pay like anesthesia, facility stay, etc.?

Surgical charges, anaesthesia, supplies are included in that amount.
</p>
<p>
There was a separate $750 cash payment for a hotel + nurse overnight. That&#39;s just for one night stay; you would have to figure out where you will recover for the rest of the time
</p>
<p>
Overall I am pretty happy with my results. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any pics currently but I may post some soon™️

Edit: just realized I calculated stuff wrong in the first comment, so I edited it to make sense

Oh okay. Good shit. Thanks again.
</p>
<p>
Also, just to be sure, is there a requirement for how many procedures are required to be done at once to qualify for these discounts, or would I just get the corresponding discount of each procedure for doing multiple of them at once, regardless of the number?

Well, since this is a cosmetic procedure, everyone&#39;s out-of-network haha. But seriously, if I&#39;m not mistaken, Dr. Raphael does not take insurance for his procedures, in general. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. If he doesn&#39;t, I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s how he keeps his prices down compared to other surgeons. At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.
