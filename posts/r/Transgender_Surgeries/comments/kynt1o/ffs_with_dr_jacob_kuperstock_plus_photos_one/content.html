<strong>
My Experience with Dr. Jacob Kuperstock
</strong>
</p>
<p>
As a primer I’m a 28 year old transwoman and I have been fantasizing about having FFS since i was 14 - so literally half my life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The initial consultation
</strong>
- My girlfriend and I felt very welcome in Dr. Kuperstock’s office. It’s easy to access in Virginia, and there is a spacious parking lot out front. Once inside, we quickly got our temperatures taken as a COVID precaution, and checked in with Ruth - who also helped us schedule the appointment. The waiting room was clean and comfortable, as was the exam room where we first met Dr. K
</p>
<p>
He’s a very down-to-earth guy, and when he asked about which parts of my face made me dysphoric, I felt very comfortable sharing. He really took his time listening to me and I definitely felt like he heard my concerns the first time. His assessment of my face was very similar to my own which was reassuring. We decided on the following procedures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Forehead contouring with a hairline advancement
</li>
<li>
A small amount of rhinoplasty to remove my nose bump
</li>
<li>
Jaw contouring.
</li>
<li>
Lip-lift
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was on the fence about having anything done to my chin. Together, we decided my chin was within feminine norms and didn’t need any work - so you don’t have to be afraid of him trying to up-sell you.
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons I decided to consult with J Kupe, (as my girlfriend calls him,) was because I heard he was an in-network provider for carefirst and that was the insurance I had for the year. Years ago, I had tried to get coverage for FFS with another surgeon, and was denied on the basis that they were outside the network. After that, I had a consultation with another surgeon who advertised FFS, but it turned out to be a giant waste of time because she did not know how to operate on transwomen. Looking back, I’m glad that happened because I think Kupe did an awesome job with my face.
</p>
<p>
Insurance - At the end of the consultation, he gave me his personal working email so I could send in the 3 therapy letters my insurance company would require. After submitting those, I was fully prepared to have to have a “back and forth” of appeals with my insurance company. Instead, 2 weeks later, Dr. Kuperstock sent me an email to let me know I was approved and could schedule my surgery. So after drying my happy tears, I gave them a call to schedule the next few appointments.
<strong>
November 2nd
</strong>
- At the “one month pre-op” appointment, we went over my face once more to make sure he had everything right. They also took pictures of my face from a few angles and gave me a folder full of really helpful info. Packing/buy lists, post-op “do’s” and “dont’s,” etc. We also went over my FMLA paperwork so I could schedule my off time, and got a list of blood tests for my PCP to order.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
November 27th
</strong>
- 3 days prior to the surgery date, I had to get a formal COVID-19 test. This was nerve wracking only because I assumed this whole thing was too good to be true, and corona would derail my surgery in some way. - Not the case. The test itself was very easy, (like a strep throat test,) and the results were negative the same day so I had peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
November 30th
</strong>
- The day of surgery I fasted and my girlfriend drove us to the center in Inova. It was tough finding the right location only because it was raining that morning. We got there a little late, and were having trouble communicating through the masks to find the right spot. It’s important to note that I opted to have my surgery at the hospital instead of the surgery center. Originally, I decided on this because I know I have a rough time coming out of anesthesia and I didn’t want my girlfriend to have to struggle getting my doped-up butt up the steps to our house and into bed.
</p>
<p>
Once inside and in the right place, the staff member who checked me in was very nice. We breathed a sigh of relief and against my better judgement, I ran to the bathroom because I just couldn’t hold it anymore. When I got back, someone was waiting to take me to get a gown and get prepped. My girlfriend was allowed to come back with me as well which was great. The nurse who took me back mentioned that I should tell her the next time I needed to go to the bathroom so that they could run a pregnancy test on me. We all shared a good laugh at the trans-irony.
</p>
<p>
From that point on, I was chillin’ on the hospital wheely bed in our private cubby area and multitasking. I met my anesthesiologist and her team first. They hooked me up with a very smooth IV - completely painless. I texted with a few of my friends who wished me well and joked with my girlfriend while we waited for “go time.” Once Dr. Kuperstock entered the area, we went over everything one last time. I signed some consent forms for the anesthesiologist, then he said he was going to go scrub up and would see me soon.I met a few more people in the surgical team, and the mood in the room was really good. They gave me some fast acting anti-anxiety meds through the IV and were like “you are going to like this” which was nice. I was feeling a lot of levity which was way better than being scared. I kissed my girlfriend goodbye and was wheeled to the OR table which was very close by. Once on it, I saw Kupe and his berry colored scrubs out of the corner of my eye, knew I was in the right spot, knew I was in great hands, and drifted off to sleep.IMMEDIATELY upon opening my eyes, I started crying. Not because of the pain, mind you, but because I was no longer burdened by the presence of my brow-bone. You can probably “see” your nose out of the corner of both eyes. You know it’s there, but you never actively notice that it’s there. If It wasn’t there, you would know. Like I said, I recognized it was gone and just breathed a sigh of relief.The nurse who was taking care of me directly after surgery was named Amanda. I think. And she was very very sweet. She asked if I was in pain - to which I said yes. “How bad is it?” I put up both hands “10/10.” So I swallowed some kind of pain medication, then something for nausea moments later. It was kind of dark in the post-op room, and she mentioned it was 9:30pm, Surgery started at 1:00pm, so I assumed, in my medicated state, that I had some complication - but was still comforted by how amazing it was to not have a giant brow bone anymore. (Can you tell that I hated that thing lol?) Since I didn’t have my phone on me (left it with my girlfriend,) I had this feeling that she was scared and confused and needed me to tell her I was awake and happy. So the nurse let me call her on the hospital phone which was very nice of her.
</p>
<p>
I think there was a spike of COVID patients that particular day so I did have to wait for a few hours for a room. I pretty much just slept so the wait was short. They moved me to the women’s wing of the hospital where I had a room and bathroom to myself. Though it may be silly to say since I more-or-less passed prior to FFS, it was really validating to be placed in the women’s center. My thought process was “oh wow, I pass that well now, huh?” In reality, I looked like a mummy, but thinking about it all makes me smile.
</p>
<p>
Around 2 in the morning, I was nestled in for the night - but I could not sleep. I went to the bathroom to see what my face looked like, bracing myself for a horror show. To my surprise, I could see a good amount of my face, and I really liked it! My eyes were swollen - but in a “bugged out” way that I thought was cute at the time. This was another confidence boost which allowed me to chill out and get some sleep.
</p>
<p>
This was an interesting night. Being alone without my phone, loopy from the drugs, excited about my face, and an overwhelming sense of peace and calm all at the same time. I really wanted to celebrate with someone. In retrospect, it was a good experience to just celebrate to myself.
</p>
<p>
Around 7:00 Dr. Kuperstock and his fellow entered my room to take a look at my cranium. They told me everything looked good and were able to unwrap / rewrap my forehead and jaw. That was nice. I honestly didn’t expect them to come back this day since I had an appointment already the following day. They let me know that they contacted my girlfriend and asked her to come pick me up and headed on their way.
</p>
<p>
The next 3 hours or so went by very slow. I wanted to go home. Although I wasn’t really hungry, I ordered some eggs for breakfast at the behest of the nurses. The moment they got to my room at about 10, My girlfriend came through the door and said “I’m here to take you home.” I felt bad not eating the rest of the breakfast, but I was ready to leave. The nurses allowed me to walk to the front door to be discharged which was a really good opportunity to stretch my legs. I really wasn’t feeling any pain at this point because of the meds, just the pressure from the headwraps. Overall, it was good to be able to stay at the hospital while the anesthesia wore off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
December 2nd
</strong>
- My girlfriend fed me pudding for 2 days which was nice. Then, at the follow up, Dr. Kuperstock taught me the proper techniques to wash my hair, clean my incisions, apply the headwraps, telfa, bacitracin, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
December 7th
</strong>
- Later that week, I was tapering off of the oxycodone prescription slowly but surely. I saved one for the “one week followup appointment” since I heard that getting the stitches removed from my head and the nose cast removed would be slightly painful. I didn’t feel a thing. My nose cast came off, and Dr. Kupe showed me how to apply tape to my nose to reduce the swelling and keep the shape. In the office I was VERY pleased with my nose once the cast came off. After the appointment, my girlfriend was dying of hunger and stopped at a burger king to get some fries. This was the point where I started eating “normal food” again, although it was still painful to chew for extended periods of time because of the incisions in my mouth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Post - Op - Depression
</strong>
- I note this here because I experienced a form of post op depression that I didn’t expect. It lasted about 2 days. After I got my nose cast off. Since I had been wanting this surgery for 14 years, I expected that I would have a depression related to not having a trans related goal to look forward to anymore. If not that, I expected the swelling in my jaw (which takes 6 months to a year to fully heal) to be my depression trigger. As it turns out, despite all of my preparatory research, I didn’t know that your nose can swell just as much as your jaw can. For 2 days, I looked like a fun-house mirror every time I took my tape off, and feared that I would just look silly forever. Luckily, I read about others who had the same feelings with regard to their rhinoplasty who ended up loving the final result. As I type this, I very much like my new nose. I think it’s important to point out that no amount of research could prep you for the post-op sads. The good news is, they don’t last long, and I was back to feeling great about my face very quickly. Please reach out to others who have gone through the same thing if you wind up feeling this way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
December 14th
</strong>
- At my 2 week follow up, I was still struggling to wash all the bacitracin out of my hair. I was very scared of my incision getting infected, so I probably used way too much. Other than that, I was healing very fast. Dr. Kuperstock said I could stop wearing the headwraps unless I felt like I needed them, and switched me from using bacitracin on my scars to a silicone scar gel which was MUCH easier to work with.
</p>
<p>
From here I don’t have a whole lot to add. I’m about 6 weeks out from surgery now and feeling AMAZING. There is this tangible difference in the way that people perceive me and I can tell based on how much less - jumpy? they are. Before, it felt like I had to overcompensate and prove myself to strangers. “Hello, yes, I know I have a lumpy forehead. I know that it’s unfortunate and off-putting. Let me justify my existence to you.” Those feelings are gone because I haven&#39;t startled anyone in 6 weeks. Now my confidence is through the roof. A picture can show a few angles, but the difference in my 3 dimensional skull is night and day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
In closing
</strong>
- Dr. Kuperstock is the real deal. I think he did a wonderful job with every part of my face. Just aggressive enough for the general beautification parts (lip and nose,) and methodically perfect with my forehead, jaw, and hairline. He did a Type 3 forehead, so you can rest assured that he will be using techniques that specifically improve transfeminine skulls. If you book an appointment to have a consultation with him, I guarantee you will love him.

Day 5 or so, just existing with icepacks. This photo is a TW because I also put the silent hill nurse in there? It gives you a good idea of what my humor was like while on Oxycodone. I was pretty much out of my mind on the pain meds.

Day 7 again in the evening after I took the tape off to replace it. This was when I started getting a little depressed, I thought my nose looked gigantic. (and it kinda did because of the swelling.)

Day 10, I was starting to feel good again. (this is a before and after to show my forehead)

Day 12, I started playing with makeup again. Big note here - FFS makes it SO MUCH EASIER to put on eyemakeup because it exposes so much more upper eyelid.

Day 16, My hair was finally (mostly) free of the bacitracin and I started REALLY feeling human again at this point.

Just for fun, 10 years ago this was my highschool senior photo, vs me now with full face makeup, FFS and years of hormones. Transition is great.

You look fantastic! You will continue to heal months later. I am 2 months past my surgery with Kupe and I&#39;m still noticing changes.
</p>
<p>
I love Dr. Kuperstock and I&#39;m so happy others are having great experiences with him like I did &lt;3

Fantastic! That&#39;s exactly why I wrote this. When I was having my consults with Kupe,
<a href="/u/erininthemorning" rel="nofollow">u/erininthemorning
</a>
hadn&#39;t even had her surgery yet, so there weren&#39;t a lot of reviews for the new practice in Virginia. Good luck, you&#39;re gonna do great! :)
