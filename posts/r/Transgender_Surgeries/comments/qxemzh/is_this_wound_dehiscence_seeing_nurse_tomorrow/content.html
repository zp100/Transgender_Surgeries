Hii I’m almost to 4 weeks post and things have been very trying for me but here to say my surgeon swears up and down that a bit of dehiscence happens to most and not to stress too much- it heals on it’s own. Just take it easy and don’t do too much :) call your surgeon though and get some peace of mind. Will also say I feel like my visiting nurse doesn’t really know what she’s doing lol

It looks like a bit of it, yeah. You seem to have caught things early, so hopefully you can prevent it from worsening.

Looking at the pic, I don’t see any. There may be some, but none I can see in the photo.
</p>
<p>
Where you have circled, the sutures are still in place and I don’t see any separation of the incisional edges. As we would write in the chart the wound edges appear to be well approximated. There is also no redness at those particular sutures so it doesn’t look like that specific area has signs of infection either.
</p>
<p>
There is an area in your circle that doesn’t appear to be your area of focus, but looks to be fluid filled and may possibly be a small hematoma. But it could also be something else, but I can’t tell from the photo.
</p>
<p>
Take care of yourself and take it easy. If you’re concerned call the office back let them know your concerns if you haven’t already. If you have and they aren’t concerned that you need to be seen, follow their instructions until tomorrow (unless there are other symptoms)
