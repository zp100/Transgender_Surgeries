Can I ask what about the aesthetics you&#39;re dissatisfied by? I think it looks great personally, although the picture quality isn&#39;t very clear. I know we all have different aesthetic preferences so I&#39;m not saying you should be happy with it, but it does surprise me a bit to hear you&#39;re not pleased.
</p>
<p>
How has your experience been overall? Do you have any non-aesthetic issues or complications? Are you happy you did it despite your concerns?

No functional complaints. And healing was pretty easy overall.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m really bummed about the size of my clit, it not being covered by the hood and my minora not really existing.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is comforting at all, but I‚Äôm a trans man and prior even to Testosterone my natal parts looked EXACTLY like yours, vulva, clit and all. Every person‚Äôs clit is different sizes and plenty of gals have large clits, also the hood only covers usually about 75% of the clit, it sits around the clit kind of like a turtleneck.
</p>
<p>
Also, you look like you have labia minora to me but I totally understand if small minora isn‚Äôt a preference for you. It‚Äôs generally seen as highly desirable and some women even have surgery to make them this small, but that‚Äôs just patriarchal stuff I think lol. Either way, it looks like looking in a mirror to me. I wish you positive feelings with your parts down the line :)

Definitely comforting. It&#39;s honestly kinda wild to hear. Very hard to believe that my result is anywhere within the distribution of natal equipment.
</p>
<p>
Maybe our &#39;look&#39; is really rare or something cause I&#39;ve SEARCHED through vulva diversity pages and haven&#39;t seen a single one that looks similar to mine lol.
</p>
<p>
Also congrats on top surgery. I see you&#39;re also having doubts. Hang in there!

I think it‚Äôs just the fact that there are so many ways the vulva can look and be different that it‚Äôs pretty tough to account for all of them, but really, it‚Äôs a pretty normal looking result you have! I would not have suspected it‚Äôs a neo-part if I wasn‚Äôt explicitly told and that‚Äôs not an exaggeration.
</p>
<p>
And thanks! I‚Äôm unfortunately in a situation where a revision is going to be necessary in my future for quality of life reasons due to painful fat necrosis, so they‚Äôll even out the asymmetry then as well. My surgeon didn‚Äôt have a lot of experience with fat patients so he didn‚Äôt really do a very even job with the lipo. üòî

Thankfully removing more tissue is a lot more feasible than trying to add more tissue!
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a big reason I&#39;m so down on my results. I&#39;d really like a more full and detailed vulva. But you can&#39;t exactly add more detail, only subtract. Unless you start getting into more intense things like skin grafts.

I believe they could maybe do something like a fat transfer? I‚Äôm not entirely sure what the inner tissue of the labia is made up of, but maybe it‚Äôs possible to do a safe/simple transfer of tissue to inside the labia for a ‚Äúfuller‚Äù look?

Yea, that&#39;s a good question. I don&#39;t really think so? The labia are like not &#39;real&#39; but simulated by making sutures in the skin to create creases?
</p>
<p>
So, hard to imagine what surface they could add adipose to. I think in other places they do fat transfer (majora, breast) there is some subdermal tissue they can pump it into? But my minora don&#39;t really have the space/vascularization for that I&#39;d think?
</p>
<p>
Tbh never seen anyone get that kinda revision. And with how common a complaint it is, I&#39;d bet someone has already asked.

Can you share links to the vulva diversity pages you referenced? My surgeon asked me to pictures that represent my surgical goal, and I‚Äôd like to find some non-porn source images.

Ugh my thing with Min Juns aesthetics is the labia minora closing before the vaginal canal instead of inner labia including the vaginal canal. I hear the &#34;different shapes and sizes&#34; thing, but I have absolutely never seen a closed inner labia then canal underneath in any cis vaginas. And I&#39;ve done
<em>
extensive
</em>
research.

Based on results i&#39;ve seen, Dr Rachel Bluebond Langner has results that I can truly say after full healing and maybe medical tattooing for pinkish/fleshier coloring looks entirely cis. Which is why her wait for aconsult is literally years at this point. My consult is next month in NY and even at that, the wait from then to surgery is 2 God damn, mother fucking years üôÉü´†ü§Æ

My friend went to Suporn, I can‚Äôt see her scars under 5.5x magnification and her gyno asked her why she had no cervix (couldn‚Äôt tell). He‚Äôs retired but I hear his prot√©g√©e‚Äôs results are very similar.

Maybe I need to reassess my own internal perception. Because you&#39;re not the first to claim it appears cis like.
</p>
<p>
Having taken a second look, does it really blend in? I&#39;m fairly petrified that it&#39;s too incongruous for anyone to find it attractive.

It really looks cis to me. If I didn‚Äôt know what the scars were because I‚Äôm trans, I would just assume I was looking at a cis vulva if I encountered this in the bedroom (when spread) or just seeing you naked standing.

If you&#39;d be happy with this result more power to you! That means you can get something that&#39;d be fulfilling for you. I&#39;m like genuinely happy for you, cause that&#39;s the goal for surgery, right?
</p>
<p>
I have a lot of trauma regarding genital appearance and anatomy from being circumcised. So I put a lot of weight in my results looking natal and not constructed. So, having it look imho much more on the side of &#39;surgical result&#39; than &#39;vagina&#39; is a big let down.

Well hopefully some kind of revision will get you what you want. I have a feeling I won&#39;t get results that I love, because I have a long history of bad luck with surgeries and medical stuff. But at the same time, I feel like I have to try. So if it ends up looking like this, which is a very cis looking vagina, then I&#39;d be elated.

I think your vulva is aesthetically good, and appears more like a natal vulva than probably most neovaginas I&#39;ve seen. Your clit doesn&#39;t look abnormally large to me; clitorises come in all shapes and sizes, and yours seems within a typical range to me. As the other commenter pointed out, large clits can also be seen as desirable; see

for a sub of mostly cis women trying to make their clits larger.

Thanks for feedback.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s funny how we&#39;re our own harshest critics. I would say that mine is one of the least natal looking ones from my surgeon. I&#39;m pretty certain I&#39;m in the lower distribution aesthetically from Jun.
</p>
<p>
As for the clit size, I&#39;m mostly disappointed that it looks like a cabinet knob bolted onto my pelvis. Women can have larger clits, but they have structure and a 3D depth to them. Mine.... isn&#39;t lol.

I can understand being dysphoric about that (I&#39;m transmasc so no personal experience with that kind of dysphoria). It seems fairly common for clits in neovaginas to look like that, so at least you&#39;re not alone in having a clit like that. Idk whether or not it can be revised‚Äîthat&#39;d be for a surgeon to say‚Äîbut if it can&#39;t, your vagina is still a lot better than what you had before, and your clit isn&#39;t even visible unless you&#39;re looking directly on between your legs with your labia spread. I don&#39;t think the appearance of your clit is particularly noticeable tbh, and it&#39;s not something my eyes would be drawn to when looking at your vulva.

Yea, it&#39;s definitely a big red flag for a neovagina.
</p>
<p>
Maybe &#39;most natal looking&#39; isn&#39;t as high a praise as I initially thought. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Since my appearance isn&#39;t really something I&#39;ve ever seen on natal equipment. Perhaps I should have gone in with more tempered expectations about how close to natal surgeons can get. :(
</p>
<p>
You&#39;re not wrong about it being better than before.

I&#39;m sorry you aren&#39;t happy with the asthetics! Hopefully there&#39;s more steps you can take to improve them! In my eyes, it&#39;s attractive looking if that helps at all
