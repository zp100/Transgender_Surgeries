Dr. RBb-L‚Äôs office sent me this template back in May as I was beginning my electrolysis sessions at Papillon Center in New Hope, PA.
</p>
<p>
Decided to share bc I‚Äôve been asked by many about this and have read where a number of women on this sub have asked specifically what this team requires.
</p>
<p>
At my appointment w/Dr.‚Äôs RBb-L and Zhao earlier this month, I‚Äôm happy to say my electrolysis progress received approval and is almost complete. AMA‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós

Having seen this before, something I don&#39;t understand is why they don&#39;t have you do hair removal on the shaft and around the shaft.  Those are something that can&#39;t be scraped and are still used.  Any guesses?
</p>
<p>
Edit: been collecting these the last year from a number of surgeons and every other one requires it which makes it further puzzling.

I specifically asked that question to Dr.‚Äôs Jun and RBb-L during my physical exam appointment at NYU-Langone earlier this month. Dr. Jun further clarified that the hair removal requirement begins at the intersection of the base of the penis/top of the scrotum and clear downward in a ‚ÄúV‚Äù area between the groin creases with the bottom of the ‚ÄúV‚Äù at the top of the anus. I was examined by Dr. RBb-L and was specifically told not to worry about the penis shaft, I‚Äôm to concentrate on removing the remaining hair on the perineum between the groin creases and I will meet their requirements.
</p>
<p>
Now, having shared that, my electrolysis sessions so far included the penis shaft down to the pubis mons so that hair is already gone. (
<strong>
Edit
</strong>
: Which, btw
<strong>
<em>
is
</em>
</strong>
required for Dr. Christine McGinn‚Äôs PI Vaginoplasty GRS). The comments from both Dr.‚Äôs coupled with this template provided confirmation that I didn‚Äôt need to have that hair removed. I just consider myself ahead of the game at this point.
</p>
<p>
Ramona, at Papillon already removed the hair from the top of the anus, up into the perineum and Dr. RBb-L pointed out what remains to be removed and I‚Äôll be finished.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
Lesson learned:
</em>
</strong>
Prior to my appointment at NYU this month, I had not shaved the pubic/groin areas since the time required by Papillon, before my previous electrolysis session back in June. My thinking was I wanted Dr. RBb-L to see exactly what hair was removed and receive direct guidance from her about what remained to be cleared.
</p>
<p>
When she asked how long it had been since I last shaved, she seemed surprised by my answer, and took a second, closer look. When I explained why I hadn‚Äôt shaved, she expressed approval for my thinking and made it a point to tell me precisely what still needed removed.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps‚ù£Ô∏è

Thank you for the question‚ù£Ô∏èTo clarify, the shaft was cleared down to where the base meets the mons pubis. There is no requirement I am aware of to have the mons pubis cleared.

Sorry for bringing it up a year later, so are you saying you need all of the scrotum cleared, not just like the bottom half that this pic kinda shows?

Hello, Correct. Entire scrotum. Since my surgery was postponed, I have used the time to remove several cycles of hair growth from the base of the shaft, down, groin crease to crease, including a couple cycles of hair growth from the shaft. I am now over 50-hrs invested in the genital hair removal. I am finally confident it has all been removed.

Ick.... I stopped like part way up the scrotum bc that&#39;s what the pic looks like. Now I learn I need to do much more. Luckily May is some time away.

You have time. I will share that my Primary Dr. prescribed a topical cream that is 2% Lidocaine and 2% Prilocaine specifically for me to use for genital hair removal. My current Esthetician is using an aggressive approach on the genital area (combination laser/no-joke electrolysis) and is now working on my face/neck. The cream works very, very well.

My client actually is going to go with Rachel Bluemond-longnameicantremembercorrectly. So that&#39;s why I was very interested in knowing if I was treating everything right as the electrologist when looking at that paper.

Thank you very helpful , since you mentioned your doing electro already.. do you use any topical?  Or lido injection?  Looking for some insight in that area as Im a big baby.  I see her may of next year and would like to get started on that section. ‚úåÔ∏è

I opted for the lidocaine injections as my electrolysis plan at Papillon Center is aggressive. My experience so far is there was no way I could have undergone what I have w/o the injections.
</p>
<p>
My advice, if you have even the idea that GRS is in your future, get started on the electrolysis NOW‚ù£Ô∏èü§ós

YMMV. I have had both, (not at the same time/place) and can say from experience that the treatments on my face in no way compares to the treatments in the pubic/groin areas. The electric current applied during the facial treatments is significantly less than the aggressive treatment I‚Äôm undergoing below the belt.
</p>
<p>
For my facial treatments, applying Aspercreme w/lidocaine and taking an Extra Strength Tylenol 1/2 hr before the appointment carried me through the session with no to little discomfort.
</p>
<p>
The genital electrolysis is much more aggressive and the only way I can get through the treatments is w/lidocaine injections.

My insurance woes kept me from starting this process much sooner. What helped was asking my insurance to assign me to a case manager who helped navigate the sticky wickets caused by claims staff who didn‚Äôt know/care/research about electrolysis coverage benefits and just disapproved coverage right out of the gate. It took a while, but the case manager eventually came through.
</p>
<p>
My problem now is getting reimbursed properly. The checks they sent me indicate whomever is processing the payments does not understand the process and it‚Äôs back to the case manager to straighten this outüòï

Getting them to approve it is 100% not an issue, *once I&#39;ve had my consult*.  I&#39;m on my state&#39;s medicare and they will cover laser and electrolysis in prep for a surgery, you just have to actually have a consult before they&#39;ll approve you.

FWIW I find the groin to be easier. I use Numb 520 about 30 minutes beforehand and I can do 2 hours straight. The last 30 minutes aren&#39;t amazing. I can do 2 hrs on my face as well with the same plan, but I feel more pain and less relaxed the entire time.
