Hey I am so fucking sorry about the comments asking for your surgeon&#39;s name. That is horrifyingly disrespectful and invasive. I understand why you&#39;re upset about it. It&#39;s really upsetting to see this kind environment where you&#39;re not being seen as a human :/

I’m getting lots of people not happy that I haven’t left my surgeons name up here. I still have to work with the surgeon and don’t want her finding out that I’m complaining about her online while I’m working with her. I’ve also had horrible experiences with death threats so it’s seem smarter to share less specific data. I might just delete the post. Thank you for your kind words

I think your aesthetic results are good and I hope you&#39;ll have some nerves reconnect as you heal.
</p>
<p>
I think you might need a revision for depth if that&#39;s an important thing to you, but I would hope it would just be one surgery. Did your surgeon have any suggestions for a revision to restore some depth?
</p>
<p>
Assuming your initial technique was PIV, there should be options for using tissue either from the colon or peritoneum to help with depth. They might not be familiar with those, but other surgeons might.

Thank you. My surgeon has been trying to tell me that 8cm is more than enough for penetrative sex and trying to gaslight me into loving the depth. She gave me 15 cm during surgery and doesn’t know what happened between then and when the packing was removed and I only had 8cm. So she hasn’t shared anything about being willing to do a revision which is really mentally hard for me because I want a game plan. I want more than 8cm.

I understand but posting doctor&#39;s name you can alert other people to be alert not choosing him or her.

Is this your way of saying you don’t like my results? If anyone wanted to really know they could make any sort of comment other than bluntly asking for a surgeons name with no other comment. They can msg me and chat and I might share that information.

Is not about what I like. If you happy it&#39;s fine you are the one needs to be happy with your results. 8cm is not enough for sex. Just letting you know I&#39;m not a hater.

I am aware that 8cm is not enough for sex. I was unlucky and some sort of problem arose while the packing was in. She installed 15cm but there was only 8cm when the packing removed. I was unlucky.

I had 5 revisions trying to achieve depth I also ended up with 10cm depth. On dic I had a revision done by Dr. Ramineni in DC now I&#39;m really happy I&#39;m at last dot using the biggest orange dilator. I was lucky all revisions were covered by insurance

It took 5 revisions to give you depth?

Yes dr. O&#39;Brien Coon was the one who did 5 failed revisions. And Dr. Ramineni is the one who finally got it right sometimes choosing an experienced doctor can be a life changer

My dr is experienced, I’ve been incredibly unlucky. I know lots of people who have had surgery with my surgeon and had great depths.

This is a lot of downvotes for not sharing my personal medical information. I’ve received so many death threats online for being trans before that it makes me more comfortable to share as little identifying or personal information as possible. I’ll share the surgeon name with anyone that wants to personally reach out. Why is this a problem?

My personal opinion is that it is helpful to share the surgeons name, but you have already invited people to DM you if they really want to know.
</p>
<p>
It is your information to share, and you do only what you are comfortable doing.  As it is, it was gracious of you to share photos and request for opinions.  Thank you for that.  It really helps the community.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have an answer to your question, but want to offer a wish for the best of luck to you in your revision decision once you make it.  🌸
