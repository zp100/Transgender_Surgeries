IMHO it only feels like a tuck for the first two months or so, after that things start to reacclimate and everything starts to settle and just feel like another body part. Sex takes a little longer to get the hang of (or did for me) but feels great once you figure out the new setup, feels nothing like anal which I always hated

I’m 5 weeks post op and it can feel like it’s tucked up kinda but not really it’s like tension/pressure but it’s very obviously because of swelling pushing down. Obv I’ve not had sex yet but I’ve been aroused and it feels a lot different and overall is more spread throughout the body

Can confirm  arousal being different.  It&#39;s... idk, warmer down there now?  I&#39;m at 4 weeks post-op.  The feeling of a particularly tight tuck is definitely fading too as things settle.

11 months out (one year on December 3rd) and it feels different in a way that&#39;s hard for me to describe.
</p>
<p>
I will say though, I was surprised how quickly the new equipment felt
<em>
normal
</em>
. Within like a month I couldn&#39;t actually remember what the old bits felt like.
</p>
<p>
I could describe what it felt like to have the old equipment, but only in the same way I could describe the taste of a food I hadn&#39;t eaten in a long time. I couldn&#39;t really remember the feeling any more, I could only remember &#39;remembering it&#39; if that makes any sense.
</p>
<p>
No regrets, would recommend. XD

I’m about 5 months out, for reference.
</p>
<p>
After everything is healed up it doesn’t feel tight or tucked or anything like that. Best way I can describe it is it feels like nothing is there, with the exception of my clitoris which feels pleasure if I stimulate it in any way.
</p>
<p>
Compared to anal it feels more tight, less length of the canal. There’s more feeling throughout the canal, but still most of the sensation is at the mouth of the vaginal canal. Also they create the vaginal canal below your prostate, so the prostate becomes analogous to the g-spot in women, and so anal feels a little less pleasurable now, and I can’t have a prostate orgasm anally now (at least not yet).

Are you saying that vaginal sex would stimulate your prostate?

Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. Since the vaginal canal is created between your prostate and your colon.

Damn, that sounds pretty cool. As someone who&#39;s never experienced her prostate and is extremely turned off by even the thought of anal, I&#39;m glad that there&#39;s still hope for some kind of sexual satisfaction when I get this done.

It never felt like a tight tuck. The closest was when the packing was still in, but it was mostly the catheter.
</p>
<p>
Truth be told, it doesn&#39;t really feel like anything. You more so notice you don&#39;t have anything. Like, going to the bathroom. You don&#39;t have it just, for lack of a better word, flop out when you pull your panties down.

Can I ask what the total cost of your surgery  was including accommodations and travel?

I dont know if my insurance will even cover it. I live in the USA. So I might have to pay for everything myself. It’s why I was asking. Thank you.

Really take  your time girl and make sure you do the research. No    need to rush into surgery so quickly. SRS is  major reconstruction.   There are risks,  complications and major after  care  involved post op.   Post-op depression  is also very common after  SRS. Truthfully, I was    indifferent about  getting the surgery.   But I  did it because I was   tired  of people  asking me if I had the surgery  and I didn&#39;t want   people to  question who  I am as a person. Getting the  surgery just   validated me as a full  woman. But, at the same time there  were some  disadvantages too. My sex drive  was  non-existent,  a  lot of    maintenance and upkeep with a  vagina,  prone to getting a UTI      because the urethra is shorter.
</p>
<p>
I miss how     effortlessly going to the bathroom was before the surgery. If I could turn back time, I   wouldn&#39;t of gotten the surgery and probably just had gotten breast   implants. So, please make your decision wisely.

Appreciate your perspective! But I’m in a weirdly opposite situation. I’m in a pretty liberal area it definitely seems like it’s “not cool” to want surgery.
</p>
<p>
I’m far from indifferent about it. I hate what I have and someone even brushing it during sex just kills it for me. I already sit down to pee anyways (standing makes a mess, and I don’t wanna look at that thing).
</p>
<p>
I know I’d have post op depression though because even standard life events make me depressed :P
