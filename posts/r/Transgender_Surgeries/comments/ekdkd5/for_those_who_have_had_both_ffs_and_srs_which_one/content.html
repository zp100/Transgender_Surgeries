For those who have had both FFS and SRS, which one meant the most to you, would you recommend doing first?

Get FFS first. Trust me.
</p>
<p>
So many trans people posting saying they get even more depressed after being misgendered while being post op. SRS does nothing for passing, only bottom dysphoria.

Tough call, being able to look in the mirror and like what I see is amazing. Not feeling like my genitals are just stuck on the front of my pelvis is nice, but I&#39;m still not ready to do anything with them post-op (only 6 weeks post op, not allowed to play around yet)
</p>

I was able to get FFS in before bottom surgery due to the requirements for OHIP to pay for bottom surgery. If I had to choose, I&#39;d probably go for FFS first, I (and others) see my face a lot more often than what&#39;s in my pants.

FFS in March, VFS in June, GAV in November. I had a busy year this year.

Bottom surgery. Being misgendered and seeing a male face looking back at me in the mirror sucked, a lot. But the thought of never being able to have sex the &#39;right&#39; way wouldn&#39;t have been acceptable.

I plan on getting both and have had one
</p>
<p>
1) bottom surgery  2) that&#39;s a very personal decision, but I did bottom first because it&#39;s been on my mind since I was 13 and pains me more 3) time difference in recovery? Not sure what you mean 4) prob ffs, so that I could more safely move about the world.

You need to dilate regularly and frequently after srs, so if you’re doing them close together it’s probably safer to do ffs first.

If you don&#39;t pass 100% I believe FFS will do the most for you socially and psychologically. Your face is used so much more that your genitals ever will be. The anxiety relieved of going even from 95% passing to 100% all the time is so liberating and can really change your interactions with the world if you have anxiety about day to day life.

This is it for me. I haven&#39;t done either surgery, so I won&#39;t post a reply to the main post.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m hoping to go from 0% or perhaps 5% passing to 50%+ passing. The only person that sees my genitals is my wife. Whereas all day every day, people see my face.

FFS gives you insight to recovering from a major medical procedure and gives you insight to how your body recovers from scars and swelling.
</p>
<p>
So I&#39;m glad I had FFS first or the swelling and suture scars might have scared the death out of me when I had GRS.

For me, the logistics of transition dictated that FFS had to come first, due to the one-year RLE requirement for SRS.  Even though I was somewhat passable before FFS, my public forays presenting as female were carefully limited to the company of a few trusted friends in a sea of complete strangers.  FFS gave me the courage to present as female at work, where everybody knew me as my male self. In that sense FFS was more profound since it was the gateway to my full-time transition. I had FFS in September 2016 and went full-time in December.  I had my SRS in August of 2017, so 11 months between surgeries.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t imagine doing one without the other, since both were part of my body dysmorphia, but I guess I would pick vaginoplasty if that was my option.  I rather be a homely girl with a pussy than a pretty girl with a dick ,but that calculus really depends on how well you passed before FFS. SRS meant I didn&#39;t have to worry about a bulge in my panties (always my concern during RLE) and I could go to a gym, or public swimming pools without concern.

I haven&#39;t had either yet, but both scheduled this year.
</p>
<p>
I think srs will mean the most.  FFS is a slight adjustment, srs is a 180.
</p>
<p>
I have ffs first and I&#39;m glad I&#39;m doing it first.  My face interacts more with the world than my vagina.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll have five months between the two
</p>
<p>
Gun to my head? SRS over FFS bc I&#39;m passing already.  If I didn&#39;t then maybe it&#39;s the other way around.  But hate this question bc I really see them both as necessary.

The thing is, if you&#39;re looking for &#34;return on investment&#34; in terms of what will make you Feel Better, it really depends. I&#39;d say that FFS will absolutely help you more day-to-day (people see your face
<em>
way
</em>
more than they see your genitals, and tucking isn&#39;t so hard especially with Leolines),
<em>
but
</em>
, I also acknowledge that I personally didn&#39;t have really debilitating bottom dysphoria - if I did, I might have felt differently about it.
</p>
<p>
VFS and FFS will both remove huge sources of other people giving you dysphoria, they&#39;re both really worth it.

Great question!  Okay I can only answer questions 2 &amp; 4. Sorry maybe I shouldn’t comment but I’ll try to help like others. First off I highly recommend doing FFS first. Why? Nobody sees what’s in your pants/underwear. Only you! Your face is seen, judged &amp; gendered every single day of your life. Having a female passing face out in public is proven to make you safer, happy, healthy, comfortable presenting &amp; increasing chances of finding a job plus love/&amp; a partner. Which is a sad reality cause it’s a persons heart &amp; soul that count. But truth is people are judged on looks. So FFS would do more for your quality of life socially &amp; psychologically. Plus GRS/SRS takes way more time, money, pain, risks, recovery, &amp; is a lifetime commitment/upkeep. Where as FFS isn’t to that extreme. I’m non op grs/srs for the reasons above &amp; cause my dysphoria isn’t bad enough to justify a need. I’m having an orchiectomy in a month &amp; can’t wait. After that only one or two very minor FFS surgeries than I’m done. Just follow your heart. There’s no right for wrong way to transition. I hope you find the happiness you deserve😊

If you pass all the time - then get SRS.  If you get misgendered a lot - get FFS.  Once I had my jaw done I get misgendered so much less.

Did my opinion, it all just depends situationally for person-to-person. Some MtFs
<em>
really
</em>
need FFS, either because they experience dysphoria every time you look in a mirror, or because they get clocked out and left, no matter what they do to mitigate the chances.  Others it&#39;s not so bad, so for them, SRS might be a more viable first option.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been told that I don&#39;t really need FFS (unless you count a trach shave), so for someone like me, SRS would be the way to go, for example.
</p>
<p>
I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s a blanket answer that applies to everybody. It&#39;s all relative and subjective per person.

Everyone&#39;s different about this.
</p>
<p>
My journey was:
</p>
<p>
2011: Vaginoplasty
</p>
<p>
2012: BA
</p>
<p>
2014: Hair transplants
</p>
<p>
2016: FFS
</p>
<p>
2017: more hair transplants
</p>
<p>
2108: Rhino revision
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Oh hey I made it thru 2019 with no surgeries lol. No plans for any more for a while either. I&#39;m pretty happy.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I did vag first because I felt like I got along in society just fine with the face I had and was pretty dysphoric esp when it came to underwear, tight pants, and swimwear. Doing vag first also allowed me to change my birth cert and all of my legal documentation which was much harder to do even in 2011. It also allowed me to get into modeling and other interests that I wouldn&#39;t have been comfortable getting into without having had done that....let alone sex! My dating life completely changed because I was too weirded out about having the wrong parts pre-op.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
So yeah that was me. I finally went forward with FFS mostly because of the side of my face but it&#39;s also allowed me to feel much more comfortable and confident not wearing makeup on the daily.
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
It will probably work in either order. everyone has their priorities. Just ask yourself what you want yours to be and why.

SRS for me.  I dont think FFS would do anything for me and it would make me feel more confused about myself.   That and hormones helped round my face out enough for my satisfaction
