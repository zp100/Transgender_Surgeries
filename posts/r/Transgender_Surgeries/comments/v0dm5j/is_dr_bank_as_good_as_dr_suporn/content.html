I’m going with Banks on January next year. I still had a chance of choosing Suporn but instead went for Banks directly. The reasons are a combination of putting my hope on the younger blood, and knowing Suporn personally trained and chose him to be his successor. He HAS to be good, right?
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen a few results and while slightly different aesthetically, they’re also very cis looking. And I’ve only seen results of Banks’s first surgery… and you have to keep in mind that a lot of those Suporn cis-identical pussies have had at least a revision done.
</p>
<p>
Bluebond-Lagner from what I’ve seen is very close to Suporn-Tier aesthetics. You can’t go wrong with any of them, and I doubt there’s a “better” choice out there.

What I’m hearing is that you want it to look perfect cisgender. IMHO, the surgeon can only do so much. A lot of what happens is determined by how your body heals, and that can sometimes be less than perfect. Many of us end up having revision surgery as a result, myself included. So, chances are that you’re going to be dissatisfied with your initial results. Hope for the best, certainly, but be realistic about what is being done to you. Again, just my opinion, but I’m just grateful to live in a time when a surgery like this is possible. The fact that my vagina may not be aesthetically perfect is actually a very cisgender thing.

Yeah, I know, I&#39;m a perfectionist about everything unfortunately. The fact that they offer up to 2 revisions (and their revisions look REALLY good from what I&#39;ve seen) is one of the reasons that I like Suporn/Bank so much.

It&#39;s hard for me to be grateful that the surgery is possible when it&#39;s so expensive that I haven&#39;t been able to afford it even a decade later, and not a single person I know irl has been able to get it

Bank is slightly better at some parts and Suporn is slightly better at others. Overall, they seem to be extremely similar.

Can you specify which parts Suporn is better at and vice versa? x

I&#39;m 2 months post op Banks, and I would say that  they are either on par or Banks beginning to surpass Suporn. The girls I knew who had suporn didn&#39;t have worse results per se, but did seem to have harder recovery.
</p>
<p>
Banks is very good. I highly recommended. I do not think you are missing out by not getting Suporn. The team is bigger than the single surgeon in any case, it&#39;s the whole Suporn clinic set up, including the method and their Aftercare.

I am the same and have money to go everywhere, have eyes on Suporn for a while, and yes, sadly that we don’t have the option anymore, but I chose bank in the end, as I believe Suporn has trained him well.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to go Bluebond, but it seems Suporn has a longer record, and bluebond might take too long. At the same time, I believe Thailand has a strong reputation when it comes to the SRS trans health care is not something that can happen just overnight.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I am biased as I have booked in with bank. Hopefully we can have more researcher can share their thoughts :)
</p>
<p>
For me Aesthatic is my top priority too! Especially when you are somewhat passing.

Do you still think he&#39;s the best choice? I have enough money to go anywhere but Thailand would be much easier since I live in Australia. I honestly feel really miserable that I missed out on Suporn...

I am non-op but if I was to get a vaginoplasty then I&#39;d go with Banks.
</p>
<p>
His aesthetics are better than most doctors in the US and Australia.

Check out the work of Dr Sutin &amp; Dr. Brassard, I think their vaginas are stunning.

Brassard patients usually don&#39;t have labia minora and that doesn&#39;t look cis IMO.

I had a look at the wiki and they don&#39;t look great to me, maybe I&#39;m too picky? They&#39;re not even close to Suporn&#39;s work...

Nope, not picky, we all have different standards. It&#39;s important to chose a suregon that will meet yours.

I honestly think Dr. Sutin does a better job aesthetically on the vulva than Brassard (comparable to Dr. Bank/Suporn)

Really? I&#39;m just going by on what I saw posted, they all looked great, but I&#39;m still researching suregons to be honest, those two seem to have good results, to me.
