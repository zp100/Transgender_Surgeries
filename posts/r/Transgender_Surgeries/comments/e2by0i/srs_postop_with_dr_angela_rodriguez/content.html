Hi all,
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to do a plug for my SRS surgeon.  Iâ€™ve had FFS and now SRS with her and I can honestly say that her bed side manner and knowledge are great.  She answered all of my questions in a professional manner and has always been really focused on ensuring a good recovery.
</p>
<p>
I can honestly say itâ€™s been a good experience and cannot recommend her enough.
</p>

Awesome to hear shes my choice!!!! I havent seen alot of comments for her so I was really worried and sceptical. I spoke with her a few months ago and sent in my packet. I have to fly from the east coast to see her so I&#39;ve been worried as we hadn&#39;t met officially.

Yeah. I only spoke to her at the consultation, pre op and post op appointments BUT calling and emailing questions has never been a problem.

That&#39;s great!!! I have a little weight to lose before I can go over for srs. I&#39;m not sure on FFS yet as insurance doesn&#39;t cover it. I&#39;ve looked for results from her and havent seen any so I&#39;m curious as to how things end up for myself. Thank you!!!!! ðŸ¥°

If you have any questions, you can ask me too.

My ex and I had just moved up to Seattle from Texas, and we drove down to CA.
</p>
<p>
We stayed in an Airbnb in Vallejo. It was about $1500 for the stay.

How was recovery in the Airbnb. And we were thinking of finding one. Can you recommend the one you were at?

Eh? The host was nice enough, but a bit meh after a while with the rules.
</p>
<p>
That being said, she&#39;s really cheap for the area, and that was worth it imo.

Oh ok I&#39;ll search out a few and see what I come up with. What I mean with recovery was I&#39;m sure after a few days you were released to the Airbnb. Was the rest of recovery there ok or would you have made changes, ie different location, closer to the hospital things like that. Sorry ðŸ¤£

Awesome to hear!  Sheâ€™ll take care of you if you go with her. She really focuses on recovery, and I can say I feel as good as can be.
</p>
<p>
I canâ€™t speak to Final results but everything looks pretty good and has been thus far healing nicely.

My insurance assigned her to me as my surgeon for top surgery. I was really peeved that they didn&#39;t let me pick my surgeon, but their office sent me before/after photos and her work seems amazing!

If by top surgery you mean FFS. That is actually why I loved her as a surgeon. Sheâ€™s studied a lot of facial surgery techniques and iirc she told me she went to Spain to learn there.
</p>
<p>
I got the impression face work is here focus. So again if by top you mean FFS I had that with her and Iâ€™m not disappointed at all.
