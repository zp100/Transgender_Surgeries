</p>
<p>
Hi all,
</p>
<p>
So, I had a bilateral orchiectomy and scrotectomy last July. There&#39;s no easy way to say this so I&#39;ll just get it out of the way â€” I have a lot of regret about getting the scrotectomy as well. This time last year, I identified as a transfemme enby and thought that this would be my end-point for surgery.
</p>
<p>
What can I say â€” it&#39;s a year later &amp; I&#39;m a girl. I have immense shame &amp; guilt about getting a scrotectomy because I know that skin would have been valuable for GCS. However, I&#39;m struggling to stop giving myself such a hard time about it because like... it&#39;s not like I wasn&#39;t sure. It&#39;s not like I hadn&#39;t thought about the decision for years &amp; years. I just couldn&#39;t have anticipated how wonderful &amp; freeing it would feel &amp; how quickly it would really start precipitating my descent into girlhood.
</p>
<p>
I could say lots more about this (and you can ask anything you want, if it might be relevant to you), but... it&#39;s not the point right now. The point is that I can&#39;t let my feelings about this prevent me from actually rolling up my sleeves and figuring out what to do about it. I actually essentially realized I want/need GCS in, like, January or February... but trying to face these feelings so soon after surgery is... a lot, and it&#39;s kept me from really digging into the research I need to do. It&#39;s still a lot, but I... can&#39;t pretend I&#39;m not sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that I want/need GCS, and I know that most surgeons have a huge wait time, so it&#39;s time to get the show on the road.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Anyway...
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I know that medical tech has advanced significantly since the days when scrotal skin was considered strictly necessary for GCS â€” right? So... I&#39;m evaluating the options nowadays (making use of the excellent wiki etc.) and trying to keep straight which ones are &amp; aren&#39;t precluded by a scrotectomy. Does anyone have any thoughts about how the results of different techniques may be affected without a scrotum?
</p>
<p>
I know that some surgeons will categorically refuse, as well â€” anyone have more details about that? I was originally looking at Dr. Chettawut, but have been sort of scared by posts like
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/cegbvc/unsuccessful_surgery_by_chettawut/content.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>
â€” I&#39;ve done a
<em>
lot
</em>
of anal in my life &amp; have basically never stopped. I&#39;ve also looked at Suporn
<em>
et al.
</em>
, who seem to be relatively reliably great(?), but I&#39;ve also seen someone say they categorically won&#39;t work without scrotal skin. I know the only way to know for sure is to ask their team, but I&#39;m... still feeling out how to deal with the emotional labor of following through with this research. And I know that some surgeons/techniques can be ruled out completely (right?)
</p>
<p>
I thought I would say a little bit about my priorities since people&#39;s reasons are all very different...
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
My #1 priority is sexual function
</strong>
, as that&#39;s the huge source of dysphoria for me... depth is really important to me. How it feels for my partners is... huge for me, in addition to how it feels for me of course. I sometimes cum from anal, but it&#39;s very rare, and I have lots of dysphoria about that... I feel like if I happened to end up with a &#34;configuration&#34; where my prostate can be hit vaginally, I&#39;d cum so easily, all the time. (I could say much more about how I know sex isn&#39;t goal-oriented &amp; it&#39;s not healthy to pedestalize orgasms, and this doesn&#39;t stop me from enjoying being intimate with my partners, but the bottom line is that I have lots of dysphoria about it &amp; I cry about sexual dysphoria all the time.) I don&#39;t know how common or reliable this is... but if it&#39;s possible to achieve prostate stimulation + depth, I would be completely happy &amp; satisfied regardless of most other details (even taking cumming out of the picture). Ease &amp; spontaneity &amp; pleasure of sex is hands-down the biggest thing for me. (I&#39;m not bothered by having to use lube, although as things are now, I become a sopping mess very easily â€” does any technique allow for that to translate at all?)
</li>
<li>
Aesthetics are honestly not all that important for me â€” I mean, I don&#39;t want to look
<em>
bizarre
</em>
, but I am not especially invested in getting a cis-passing result or being &#34;unclockable&#34; â€” I&#39;m not planning on being intimate with anyone who doesn&#39;t know this about me. On the outside, I am mostly just concerned with being soft &amp; gentle to feel. So if lack of scrotal skin only translates to a loss of &#34;authenticity&#34;, that would be best-case scenario for me.
</li>
<li>
Logistics are not a priority for me â€” meaning that cost, domestic vs. foreign, etc. are not huge factors in my decision. I am privileged to be able to work around these details.
</li>
<li>
Upkeep/healing/dilation is not a priority (within reason) â€” I am willing to sign up for whatever healing/dilation timeline has the best results (probabilistically speaking).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
Body info
</strong>
: I&#39;m 28, relatively good shape (neither under- nor overweight). Been on HRT for like... 5 years or so. As far as getting neutered goes, I&#39;ve healed extraordinarily well; my whole perineum is very smooth &amp; soft ^^ I feels small &amp; cute all the time. I&#39;m 1,000% satisfied with that operation in itself â€” aside from the opportunity cost of affecting my GCS results. But my dysphoria about my hen hasn&#39;t stopped increasing. I actually get
<em>
more
</em>
erections than before I got neutered, for whatever reason, &amp; they bother me more than ever. I want them to stop so bad.
</p>
<p>
Here are a couple of photos of my bits, for context. These are from today, so just shy of 1 year post-op. (It felt weird to attach them directly to this post in case anyone didn&#39;t want to see.)

</p>
<p>
Thanks to anyone who read through this (kind of emotional) post! I&#39;m going to continue researching on my own of course, but I thought since I have a kind of unusual situation, I would ask the community sooner than later. Any insight or wisdom is appreciated â€” I know some of these questions are probably basic, but I am having trouble assembling the full picture of what my surgery means for GCS. I seem to be fundamentally incapable of getting to the point in any reasonable amount of time, so thanks for coming to my TED talk ðŸ˜…

With PPT (pull-through) vaginoplasty, the scrotum is not needed.

Suporn says it on his site, but Iâ€™m not sure any other surgeon has this requirement
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bilateral orchiectomy is not recommended prior to SRS, but is permitted. If the scrotal sac has been removed, the applicant must seek elsewhere to undergo SRS.
</p>

I know other people have already said this, but you have options! You shouldnâ€™t feel shame or regret about getting a surgery you needed, especially since you will absolutely still be able to get a fully functional and pretty kitty. Iâ€™m going to Dr. Wittenberg for ppt next year, Iâ€™d recommend looking at her or other ppt surgeons!

Although I didnt have a scrotectomy, I did have a zero depth vaginoplasty last year - this means I had obly a vulva (some will argue it was a vulvaplasty, it was coded to insurance as a vaginoplasty so whatever).
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, I decided that I needed to have the canal. Alot of my scrotal skin was used as labia which turned out great I think, but in your case, I am not sure what they&#39;d do. Last Friday I had a canal added by use of abdominal skin graft. So far all is well and while things are totally perfect, I really like my look and feel!  I&#39;ve not started dialating yet, but when the surgeon removed my packing, it was about a inch long dildo looking thing and that thi g was buried in me!  He said that he was able to achieve much better depth than with the standard procedure and he was quite thrilled.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sure you can achieve this with ppt as well, but the use of other skin grafts may be a source for any lacking materials.
</p>
<p>
Look through my posts and you&#39;ll find pics of my original post op pics well after healing, and you&#39;ll also find a photo from last week of my first view of the revision/canal addition. Its not pretty, as I had some minor labiaplasty and clitorplasty work done as well.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any questions - I hope you get what you need!

If you want a canal, then you will need to look at surgeons that to PPT or colon procedures. You can find them in the wiki.

As others have already said, given that you are placing the highest priority on sexual function and depth, your options are peritoneal pull through (PPT) or sigmoid colon surgery.  Start with contacting surgeons who do those surgeries, and ask if they will do the surgery without scrotal skin.

You will want to ask surgeons, but you should still be able to achieve a full depth vaginoplasty, it may just require a bit more effort on the surgeons&#39; part and possibly a bit of skin graft depending on technique used.
</p>
<p>
As a side note, looking at your pictures, you may want to get checked over for a connective tissue condition such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, as it can cause skin markings like that. It is generally good to know for sure before going in for surgery, as how your body forms scar tissue definitely can change how your results may turn out in the long run.

Iâ€™d had no prior surgeries, but my surgeon, Dr Min Jun, does work on ppl with limited material. He performs robotic peritoneal pull through. Iâ€™d highly recommend him and am very happy with my results, you can see them on my page. I have no idea whatâ€™s possible or realistic in your case, but you could grab a consult and find out. His wait time is pretty short and heâ€™ll do telehealth ones if u want.
