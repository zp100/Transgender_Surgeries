This campaign is in response to the the recent dehiscence post where Kathy Rumer severely injured her patient

<h1>
We need to take immediate action now before she hurts someone else.
</h1>
<p>
Dr. Kathy Rumer is currently performing surgeries at Roxborough Memorial Hospital.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the number in the flyer
<strong>
215-509-3731
</strong>
where you will get someone right away, you can alternatively call
<strong>
(215) 487-4511
</strong>
for patient relations. Lets light up their switch board and demand that they drop this dangerous and transphobic surgeon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
And for those who aren&#39;t familiar.
</strong>
<strong>
Dr. Kathy Rumer‚Äôs atrocities, dishonesty, and disregard for the safety and well being of her patients include but are not limited to:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Rumer attempts to silence two of her low income trans patients through a SLAPP suit. Rumer used a right-wing affiliated transphobic legal team and brought the case before an anti-LGBTQ Trump appointed judge:

<p>
Rumer on record threatening journalists and doctors with her right-wing lawyer:

</p>
<p>
Rumer‚Äôs staff ignore the patient&#39;s chart, prescribe medication which could be fatal to the patient:

</p>
<p>
Rumer botches FTM patient, Rumer‚Äôs staff frequently misgendered the patient:
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/xjb0ogd.png">https://i.imgur.com/xjb0ogd.png</a>
</p>
<p>
Rumer denies patient surgical follow up care because of negative review (transcript at bottom of page):

</p>
<p>
Rumer ghosts patient after major complication, later instructs patient to cut off dangling labia with scissors:

</p>
<p>
Rumer casually admits to going through patients&#39; medical records in order to witch hunt her detractors and labels her own patients as ‚Äútransphobic trolls:‚Äù

As long as she&#39;s licensed to practice, everyone in medicine should be embarrassed (at best).

She diminishes us all - trans history or not.

Wish the world cared about us more. If she was hurting cis patients she‚Äôd likely get the Macchiarani or Duntsch treatment (well, hopefully not the former considering that piece of shit only saw limited jail time). We gotta do all we can for ourselves.

I just got off the phone with the complaints line at the hospital. People need to call it. They are actually processing these complaints and there&#39;s a chance we could get something done here

Signed the petition. I&#39;ve also made an attempt to contact the Trans healthcare website to try &amp; get them to remove her as a resource/referral since I saw that a couple of people had only gone to her because they saw her as a resource/referral on their website. I don&#39;t know if it will do anything, but I couldn&#39;t not say anything. They&#39;re perpetuating the problem if they keep her listed, &amp; more people could get hurt because of it.

<p>
As horrifying as that incident is, nowhere in either of the posts did she say she was anywhere near death. I&#39;m by no means defending Rumer or saying that she did or didn&#39;t fuck up, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s a bizarre choice to write something inflammatory that you don&#39;t know is true about someone who is so litigious

That patient could have easily of died from an infection, and considering how Rumer prescribes homeopathic quack medicine as an anti-biotic the chances of this being lethal was much higher.

Folks can downvote me all they want, I&#39;m just trying to stop OP from getting sued. It&#39;s been a minute since I took torts, but I don&#39;t think &#34;well I guessed based on a quasi anonymous reddit post&#34; is the most robust defense for libel

I did change it, but yeah.
</p>
<p>
Because this is the reason why Rumer has been able to go a decade without any accountability. For example Susan&#39;s Place (who is complicate) would delete any negative reviews or accounts of Rumer for fear of being sued by her.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
No surgeon should ever hold this amount of fear over a community.
</strong>
Your being downvoted because you are essentially giving Rumer power over you and potentially anyone who would want to fight back against this surgeon.
<strong>
Her narrative of fear needs to be dismantled, not propped up.
