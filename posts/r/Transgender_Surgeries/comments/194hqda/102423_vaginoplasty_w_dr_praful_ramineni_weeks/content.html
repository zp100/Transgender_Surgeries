This is actually a great example of dehiscence looking really scary early on but healing pretty well by itself

It is! I was

really
</em>
worried as it was happening, but it&#39;s turned out really good! I have to massage the area a lot more than the other side, since there&#39;s a bit of extra scar tissue there, but it&#39;s otherwise no big deal!

Massage the area? due to the scar tissue? what exactly do you mean by that?

Yup, exactly! Massaging the scar tissue just helps it break up and soften over time :)

Oh i remember I wanted to ask a couple more questions
</p>
<p>
1) What was your process for cleaning the area? Especially before it closed, did you use any specific product or put something on top before putting on unerwear+pads when you needed to go out?
</p>
<p>
2) How frequently did you douche
</p>
<p>
3) Regarding the UTI, did you use oral or local antibiotic? Remember hearing something about oral ones not working as well.

<p>
Sure thing!
</p>
<p>
1) Once the separation had started healing by second intention (around week 2-3) and after every time I dilated, I used a fresh baby wipe (Huggies NaturalCare unscented) to gently clean over the area the separation. Then I would take some bacitracin ointment on my glove (100% bacitracin,
<strong>
not
</strong>
triple antibiotic/Neosporin) and rub it all over the separations starting at the top and working my way down. From there, it was just underwear and pads!
</p>
<p>
Showering was pretty much the same - start from the front and work back and
<strong>
very
</strong>
gently with Dial antibacterial. After drying off, add bacitracin as usual, then pads and undies!
</p>
<p>
2) In the first 2 months or so, I started douching every single day - first with soapy water (Dr. Bronner&#39;s pure castile baby soap, unscented) then with just water to rinse. I&#39;ve since been advised to stop douching, as that could be exacerbating my internal granulation. As with all things like this, though - your surgeon knows best!
</p>
<p>
3) Oral antibiotics, as that&#39;s what was prescribed to me. I&#39;m allergic to a
<strong>
lot
</strong>
of antibiotics though and didn&#39;t know there was a topical route - I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was placed on the oral specifically to avoid any reactions.

Thanks for the details, btw was bacitracin ointment part of the list of meds Dr. Ramineni prescribes prior the surgery or your own thing?
</p>
<p>
I know katie told me that you can get the meds required post op prior the surgery but didnt say which meds exactly.

It isn&#39;t, no! You can get bacitracin ointment at most pharmacies just OTC - it&#39;s not a prescription based thing.
</p>
<p>
For the prescriptions Dr. Ramineni/Katie sent, I had: oxycodone/acetaminophen (generic percocet), cefalexin (antibiotic for post-op), and ondansetron (nausea, I didn&#39;t need this). Especially since I was staying locally, I had them sent to a pharmacy near my family&#39;s place. I&#39;m not sure how it works if you&#39;re picking them up out of state (esp. because of the opiates)

This is mostly (not the T and wound parts) so great to see and read. I actually already started injecting myself with T to see how my body is doing with it and just to kinda check levels, etc before and after the surgery to make sure I keep my T numbers up there. As you know I‚Äôm getting my Ramineni pussy on April 9 and as little as I‚Äôm looking forward to the big deal healing I‚Äôm so excited too!!! Yours really looks great so congratulations.

Hello. Everything looks great and looks to be healing nicely. Please don&#39;t take any offense to this comment/question...did you specifically not shave the rest of the area due to the surgery (your inner thighs, upper legs, etc.)? Do you plan on removing the hair from those areas..? You have a decent amount of it, and it gives off an incredibly masculine vibe, to be perfectly honest. If you don&#39;t mind that, or if it&#39;s what you&#39;re going for, that&#39;s great. (Truly). Your neo vagina also looks really good! I just think that if you decide to try and have a more femme look, shaving or otherwise ridding yourself of that body hair will do wonders. I&#39;m really impressed with how your surgery came out! I hope it continues to heal well, and that your dilation sessions go smoothly. Also, I think it&#39;s wonderful that you&#39;re able to have a clitoral orgasm; you had a great surgeon, it sounds like. Best of luck to ya!
</p>
<p>
Edit: I sincerely apologize for the way I worded this comment, and for my insensitivity. I apologize for not fully reading/comprehending the post before commenting. Also, I realize my opinion wasn&#39;t exactly asked for, and therefore i shouldn&#39;t have given it (i honestly didn&#39;t mean for it to be offensive in any way, and I&#39;m really sorry). I should just delete the comment, but I&#39;ll leave it for posterity. Sadly, it&#39;s like literally one of the first comments I&#39;ve ever made on Reddit (I mostly just read other ppl&#39;s posts and comments) so, I&#39;m not off to a very good start...I guess I&#39;ll just keep my mouth shut until I&#39;m better educated on things, as I&#39;m new to discovering being trans, and I&#39;ve a lot to learn. Again, I&#39;m sorry. I really feel awful, and hope you can forgive me for what I&#39;ve said.

Hello! Thank you for the kind words of healing!
</p>
<p>
While some of what you wrote is a little off-color, I
<em>
do
</em>
accept your apology and don&#39;t believe you meant this comment in bad faith. I don&#39;t think I need to go on about what in your post was wrong or was read as insensitive - there are some others below me and your edit makes it clear - but I do actually appreciate that you left this post up with the added edit!
</p>
<p>
Learning is a journey and growing throughout that journey will have its pains. I&#39;m not going to sit here and pretend I didn&#39;t say and do some pretty awful things earlier in my life, even against the trans community, without knowing what I did was wrong or why. I was just lucky enough that the vast majority of that experience was before social media was really a thing, especially not openly public social media like reddit. I hope some day you can think back on this post and feel some level of pride that you&#39;ve grown and learned more since!
</p>
<p>
To follow that and answer your original post&#39;s question - I don&#39;t plan on removing hair down there, really! I&#39;m pretty hairy all over my body and have really come to love my body hair. Since I&#39;m nonbinary and like presenting masculine (I spend a lot of time in bear communities...), this really fits with me and feels good/right!
</p>
<p>
If you have any other questions, even ones about my identity or journey, please feel free!

I really appreciate your taking the time to reply, and for being so very kind and understanding. I&#39;ve literally been thinking about this for 2 days (or so, however long it&#39;s been since I left it)...I cried when I read what other&#39;s had replied (not that anyone was mean to me, I was just ashamed and embarrassed, and felt horrible that I said some things that could make you feel badly), and I cried again when I read your reply (I cry all the time, this is nothing new. Just saying I&#39;m quite emotional. I kept thinking about it, and feeling like a shitty person). So, thank you, truly.  As well, thanks for your understanding. It means a lot. For you to put yourself in my shoes, rather than jump down my throat, was very mature of you. I don&#39;t know what I was expecting if you replied, but that wasn&#39;t it! Thank you, truly. I certainly do have a lot to learn, and this post is obviously something I regret, but that I can also potentially learn and grow from. As you said, hopefully one day I&#39;ll look back and be proud of how far I&#39;ve come with things. Someone had replied that I should delete my account. I&#39;ve been pondering doing so, and tbh I was gonna do just that, until I saw this reply from you. Now I&#39;m thinking, much like I left the post up, perhaps I should keep the account. Idk. In any event, I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for replying, and being so kind and understanding.  Thank you for your forgiveness. It means more than you could imagine.‚ù§

Was the clitoris exposure a choice, or? Will it retreat?

I did specifically ask for a larger/more prominent clitoris, so I suppose so! There&#39;s still plenty of swelling (the worst is over, but it won&#39;t truly go down for several months still), so it may retreat further! I don&#39;t seem to have a clitoral hood, but that&#39;s usually something you need a revision for anyway. I also asked for prominent outer labia, so it&#39;s possible there wasn&#39;t a lot of tissue remaining for that.

Thank you! &lt;3

I&#39;m hoping the pain gets even less from here, haha. I&#39;m pretty tired of feelin&#39; it by now, I won&#39;t lie! But recovery is a marathon, not a sprint!

I‚Äôm so happy for you and to see your healing so well. I know it‚Äôs been a rough road but you have a great result and it‚Äôs just going to get better. Thank you so much for taking the time to update us. It‚Äôs so helpful and important for me since I too will have a Ramineni vagina come April. I‚Äôve already started giving myself testosterone injections before my surgery  just to get my body and me used to what I will need to be doing for the rest of my life. I actually love the whole thing of it as it somehow addresses my own particular dysphoria. Keep healing and enjoying the testosterone and thank you again.
