Was treated very well at PAI, especially by their liaison who made all the arrangements for my hotel and travel while I was in Thailand. I&#39;m somewhat happy with my result. The introitus is usually better concealed by the inner labia but I took the last picture right after I finished dilating. No flattering angles, just just wanted to show how it really looks.

My clitoris is still extremely prominent which is the only thing I&#39;m not really happy with. It causes me painful chaffing sometimes and can be painful when bending down. I&#39;ve been told to wait 6 months to a year for the swelling to subside but I haven&#39;t really noticed any further reduction in the swelling in the last month. Is it actually likely to continue reducing in size? Is a revision to further reduce the size of the clitoris possible? I would just want it to not be protruding so much so it doesn&#39;t cause me pain.

I think you have a nice result, the scaring looks minimal. The clitoris is a bit too exposed but you can get that fixed later. Do you have good depth?

Still a lot more healing left to do at 4 months. I think it was 9 months before things started to look normal for me
