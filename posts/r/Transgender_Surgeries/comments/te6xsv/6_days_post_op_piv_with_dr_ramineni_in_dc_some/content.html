<p>
I reached 6 days post op after PIV with Dr Ramineni. I had the cathedar and packing in over the weekend and removed today and began dialating. Not painful but you feel the pressure.
</p>
<p>
General Pain has been, next to none. Though I have been told my pain tolerance is incredibly high as what I might judge as nothing might be a lot for others.
</p>
<p>
Movement before packing and cathedar removal was little to none, now I&#39;m moving around like a spring chicken.
</p>
<p>
I also had a bowel movement again and peed for the first time on my own.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll do a detailed post around 3 or 4 weeks until then feel free to ask any questions!

I’m envious of your high pain tolerance.  Your vag looks good so far.  I think it will heal nicely.  Congrats and thanks for sharing.♥️

Congratulations! I found that he does amazing work, as I had my PIV surgery back on September 28th 2021!

I 100% agree!  It goes far towards a sense that you made he right choice when you find others who have had a great experience with the surgeon as well!
