I am very happy the results and everything seems to be working properly. I am currently dealing with some hypergranulation on the left side (right side on the pictures) of my vaginal canal, I have already been treated and hopefully it has healed fully soon. The left side has healed more slowly since I had a small wound separation on the car ride leaving Montreal (8 days post op) but it hasnâ€™t hurt too much. I am mostly back to 100% and have started working out again and being much more active.
</p>
<p>
I donâ€™t have any minor labia and not much of a clitoral hood, but it hasnâ€™t caused any issues, and even though I would have preferred to have them, I am incredibly happy with the results and feel much more at peace with myself.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to comment :D
</p>
<p>
Edit: Forgot to mention, second pic is with my legs spread.
</p>
<p>
Edit2: Other detail, I have only been massaging the scars with silicone cream for 3 days, hopefully they will be less visible with time.

Im glad you like your results!! May I ask you why didnt he give you some inner labia? Did he tell you before surgery? He forgot to do them? He never does them?

I am not quite sure. He told me that he had made a minor labia, but we would have to wait until the swelling had gone gone down to see if it had stuck. Obviously it hasn&#39;t, but it was something that I was expecting since it&#39;s not everyone who goes to him that end up with one.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the swelling is too intense and it causes it to fuse during the healing process? I am honestly not too sure.

He told me that he tried to make them both but that there was no guarantee that they would &#34;survive&#34; the healing process. I have seen other results from Brassard with a hood and a minor labia, it seems to depend on how your body handles the healing process.

Hi, I happy that you like your result. I assume you are Canadian and weâ€™re covered?.
</p>
<p>
Dr.Brassard does pretty much what he wants to people. One of my fiend has no labia minora.  My surgery was completed in 1:37min. A girl I know got her no depth survey from him Iâ€™m 1:30 min.
</p>
<p>
Bunch of girls are actually taking legal action against him for destroying our genitals in record time.

Dead clitoris, no vaginal sensation, bad looks.  Feeling of having a cram up penis under the skin, etc. I mean the type of problems you expect from a guy that rushes surgery. 1:30 min for a life changing major surgery.

Yes, I should be able to feel pleasure and have orgasms. I have been able to &#34;explore&#34; the clitoris and around for the past three days and it&#39;s been very pleasurable, I haven&#39;t quite reached an orgasm yet but I am really close. I feel that everything is working as it should be.

Do you have any concerns with the fact that your butt crack leads into your front crack? Do most of his results look like that?

Thatâ€™s how a lot of vulvas look lol. Womanâ€™s anuses are very close to their vaginal canal. Itâ€™s still two separate cracks and two separate openings (which you can actually see in the second picture). They can just look seamless depending on how someone is posed (especially in pictures). No need to make OP feel weird about her natural anatomy.

Not really, it&#39;s not something that I have looked at in other results, but for myself it has caused no issue. There is still a bunch of space in between, I have a no issue about going in &#34;the right hole&#34; so I don&#39;t anticipate a problem for sex.
</p>
<p>
It might be on the long side but, speaking for myself, it does not cause concern.
