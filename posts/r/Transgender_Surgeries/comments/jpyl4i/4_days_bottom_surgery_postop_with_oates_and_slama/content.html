Right now it&#39;s Saturday, and I&#39;m coming off SRS with Oates and Slama this past Tuesday. Wanted to provide a few observations as I heal.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
I had been on a waiting list since 2017, so getting a surgery date has been a long road. COVID made it all the worst.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Once I saw Dr Slama for the surgical consult, I received my date, which was literary three and a half weeks after that consult.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Be extra prepared for being intensely hangry the night before. They told me to go on an all clear liquid diet, so I tried the find broth that had the most calories. Also, the colon cleanse is no joke and it really sucks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Day of surgery was super efficient. I went in at 6 AM, was in a hospital bed by 7, hooked up and in the OR by 8. The surgical team was all friendly and nice, and they all stopped by to support me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The last thing I remember was the anesthesiologist telling me he was giving me happy juice. Then I blacked out. The next thing I remember was being in the PACU, complaining how my arms were in a ton of pain (apparently they strap your arms down). My procedure took most of the morning and afternoon.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I felt very little pain the first night, with one exception. I had to ask them to up the dosage on my epidural because the numbness was wearing off and imwas starting to feel pain.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I was really woozy on the second night. I was still doing on the epidural (they given you fentanyl), was given gabapentin for nerve pain, and large doses of Tylenol. I also had antibiotics introduced through my IVs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You&#39;re probably not going to sleep well. I was in and out every few hours, and the care team would check in every few hours to check my vitals and empty my urine bag.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No one tells you about the bloating and constipation, but it&#39;s literally the worst. Your GI system is starting back up but you have no bowels to move, and your bum is numb. So you just feel gassy and gross. I didn&#39;t have a BM really till I was discharged.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I started walking around on day three. Getting out of bed is rough, but I didn&#39;t have any issues waddling around. Plus it helps get your bowels moving again.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They suture in JP drains into the surgical site to prevent abcesses. These are the literal worst. You can feel the tubes anytime you try to move, and they can cause sharp pain if you&#39;re not careful. It was a relief to have them out on Friday.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Having the urine bag is a minor inconvenience but I&#39;m managing. TBH they stuffyour new vag with gauze and that&#39;s the most uncomfortable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I didn&#39;t experience enough pain to warrant taking oxycodone, just Tylenol. But I think my body heals quickly and I tend to have a higher pain tolerance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Getting discharged was nice but I am still out of it from not having a full night&#39;s sleep and being hopped up on different drugs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The care team was great and all the nurses were super wonderful to me. You could also tell they invest in their residents, many of them came and checked on me/ took the lead on post-op care.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have a post op appt with Oates on Monday. I&#39;ll give an update later next week if folks want. Otherwise feel free to ask any questions!

Congratulations! I had bottom surgery with them 7 weeks ago! I’m glad you also had a good experience at BMC - I really liked all the nurses and PAs. I got pretty uncomfortable over the weekend, but things get much better once the packing is removed on Monday

Were you given zofran for the nausea?
</p>
<p>
Interesting how some surgeons use drains and others don&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t have any and it doesn&#39;t seem fun at all.
</p>
<p>
Do you have a bolster?
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t have a bowel movement until day 4 and at home either, but avoided any bloat, maybe due to fairly healthy hospital food and small portions.  Were you on colace or ducalax while admitted?
</p>
<p>
Did they show you immediate post op pics and if so, were you happy?

They did me zofran, but I didn&#39;t have a whole lot of nausea in general. I was given colace, which helped a tiny bit. I didn&#39;t see post op pics, but from what I could tell, it was a mess down there, and that&#39;s about what I expected.
