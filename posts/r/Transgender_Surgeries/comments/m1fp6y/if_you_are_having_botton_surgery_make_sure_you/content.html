A lot of surgeons now are opting to just take care of the follicles during surgery, saving you the time/expense/pain of getting hair removed that isn&#39;t required to be.

Whatâ€™s the alternative for them though? They donâ€™t get paid for another year and maybe you decide to go to another surgeon who says you donâ€™t need electrolysis.

Couldn&#39;t agree more.  You can&#39;t cauterize follicles you can&#39;t see.  The whole surgery is 3-4 hours so maybe you get one hour spent on follicle removal in the OR, which  is allegedly just as effective as dozens of hours spent on laser/electrolysis over a period of months?  I have a hard time believing that.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon (McGinn) asked for 4-6 full clearings. To me, it was worth the pain and expense not to risk hair growing inside me.

Thatâ€™s a very interesting point Iâ€™ve never heard before. Though it does raise the question of how itâ€™s as effective as it is.

Itâ€™s not a stranger on the internet, thereâ€™s numerous stories of this happening and papers published on it. Iâ€™d be very wary of blindly trusting surgeons. Thereâ€™s too many horror stories.

Dr Marci Bowers&#39; surgery prep guide: &#34;Get hair removal done&#34;
</p>
<p>
Surgery date pops up a year earlier then expected.
</p>
<p>
<em>
calls office
</em>
</p>
<p>
Me: &#34;How worried do I need to be about hair? Haven&#39;t had money, time nor energy to get it done.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Office: &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Marci will take care of it. She&#39;s through.&#34;
</p>
<p>
<em>
pre op appointment with Marci
</em>
</p>
<p>
Me: &#34;Do I need to worry about hair growth at all?&#34;
</p>
<p>
Marci: &#34;No. I&#39;ll take care of it during surgery and a healthy ph will keep hair growth from occuring long term.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Tldr: If vaginal hair growth becomes a problem, get tools from a dr to raise vaginal ph / acidity.

My comment wasn&#39;t a recommendation to not get hair removal done. I made sure to have an option for treating the possability post op.
</p>
<p>
If it was going to be something I&#39;d have to deal with, I expect I would have encountered it by now.
</p>
<p>
When post op, focus on acidity.

Iâ€™m not sure how you could do that and Iâ€™ve not heard of anyone doing it. I assume boric acid would make things acidic, but how long can you do that for?

The normal average acidity for outer skin is weakly acidic at 4.7 ph. The normal average for the vaginal tissue is more acidic between 4.5 and 3.5 ph. Battery acid is a ph of 1.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;d be vaginal application of acetic acid. The brand names are Acid Jelly, Acidic Vaginal Jelly, Aci-Jel, Bidette, Fem pH, Feminique, Massengill Douche and Relagard.
</p>
<p>
The way it would work is to keep the ph between 3.5 and 4.5 until the microbiome maintains it without assistance. Hair follicles need a ph between 4.5 and 5.0 to grow hair which is more alkaline then the normal for vaginal tissue.

I don&#39;t think you can depend on microflora to maintain an acidic pH in neovaginas. The pH of neovaginas is in the 5.0-7.0 range, and contains a much different assortment of microflora than natal vaginas. Keratinized skin grafts do not support lactobacillus growth to a significant extent because it does not excrete the glycogen that lactobacilli thrive on. Also, keratinized skin does not have active proton transport going on in the epithelium, which helps lower pH.

I read the paper. The only applicable conclusion is, those specific microbes aren&#39;t viable in the neovagina microbiome. From there, we can only look to microbiology to draw conclusions.
</p>
<p>
By keeping the ph between 3.5 and 4.5, only microbes that survive between 3.5 and 4.5 can populate the microbiome. Once the microbial population can sustain itself on the available nutrients, it becomes stable. Once it&#39;s stable, it maintains the ph.
</p>
<p>
The two ways to do it are,
</p>
<ul>
<li>
shock the microbiome and let it populate with microbes in the 4.5 - 3.5 range
</li>
<li>
or dial the ph slowly to allow the successive generations of the existing colonies until they stabilize between 3.5 and 4.5.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Either way, they need to be weened off the applied acid to ensure they aren&#39;t using it as a food.
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s effectively the same process as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHNPnO5UOYQ" rel="nofollow">modifying yeast</a>
with more repeat steps but fewer process steps.

There is more than one paper on the subject, but the one I was thinking of was
<em>
BMC Microbiology
</em>
2009, 9:102.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, I don&#39;t think there is any practical way of keeping vaginal pH low, excluding endogenous lactate-excreting organisms and the active proton pumps found in vaginal epithelium. You can&#39;t endlessly iirrigate the neovagina.
</p>
<p>
Simply &#34;shocking&#34; the existing microbiome won&#39;t do it. Lactobacilli flourish in the vagina because  (a) they are well tolerated by the vaginal epithelial cells, and (b) they are provided nourishment by estrogen-mediated glycogen synthesis. It&#39;s a symbiotic relationship that has evolved over thousands of years. The lactobacilli aren&#39;t genetically modified. They are wild species that colonize the vagina for the reasons mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
Lactobacilli are unique in their function in the vagina. Production of lactate is essential to their viability. Lactic acid blocks histone deacetylases, thereby enhancing gene transcription and DNA repair. Lactic acid also induces autophagy in epithelial cells to degrade intracellular microorganisms and promote homeostasis. The idea that you can control pH some other  way and come up with the same microbiome or same effect on the vaginal epithelium is misguided. It&#39;s not all about pH. It&#39;s about lactic acid.

Title: Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women
</p>
<p>
Published: 20 May 2009
</p>
<p>
BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:102 doi:10.1186/1471-2180-9-102
</p>
<p>
Background: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients&#39; characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge.
</p>
<p>
Results: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears.
</p>
<p>
On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women
</p>
<p>
There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively).
</p>
<p>
Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets.
</p>
<p>
Conclusion: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
</p>

<p>
As I said. I read it. It made no recommendations. This one however, after translating the analogues, does:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5868856/" rel="nofollow">Modifying and reacting to the environmental pH can drive bacterial interactions</a>
.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The idea that you can control pH some other way and come up with the same microbiome or same effect on the vaginal epithelium is misguided.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Controlling the environment directs the routes the microbes can evolve. Exactly the way it works in any microbiome, any petri dish, etc.

This line of conversation is getting way off-topic from the original OP.  I read the paper you cite, and I think it is a big leap to extrapolate from bacteria grown in buffered soil, none of which are commonly found in the neovgina.  Secondly, you completely ignore the role that lactate plays in the beneficial aspects of lactobacillus colonization. It&#39;s not just about pH. Thirdly, keratinized epithelium is not the same as vaginal epithelium, a fact you seem to ignore. Find me a paper that says repeatedly douching can cause colonization with lactate-producing bacteria in neovaginas I will be suitably impressed.

Lots of people get laser and not electrolysis. Is it common that after 1-2 yrs of laser there is still hair regrowth?

It&#39;s possible that it will come back, not a guarantee. Imo not at all worth the risk, but some people are fine with just laser

Unfortunately I&#39;ve had laser in the past, so there&#39;s not really any hair to do electrolysis on.

Iâ€™m getting SRS with Dr. bluebond-langner in May of 2021, and she said it was fine that Iâ€™ve only had laser done, and sheâ€™d scrape whatever is leftover. Is this because the inner most part of the vagina is peritoneal tissue and not penile/scrotal skin, so thereâ€™s less risk of hairs in the deeper part of the vagina? In my mind, I feel like that would make the risk less severe, and god forbid if there were hairs inside, theyâ€™d be close to the entrance where the scrotal skin is used and could be easily taken care of. Am I wrong? Lol.

I read that having laser before surgeon scraping is a bad idea. As it makes the follicles smaller and harder to spot during the scraping and increases the risks they miss some. However, I saw this on a forum posted by someone that helps people get surgery in Thailand. I donâ€™t know how reliable it is. It seems to make sense though.

Yep. I&#39;m ftm but the surgery I&#39;m planning on uses skin grafts that&#39;ll be from my forearm. I have heard too many stories of regrowth from laser, I&#39;ll be going with electrolysis.
