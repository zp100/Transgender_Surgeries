My surgeon just told me that 8cm is plenty of depth for penetrative sex. How does anyone feel about that comment? How is a 3.15‚Äù vaginal canal plenty for intercourse. A 3.5‚Äù penis would hit the back of me and hurt. I can‚Äôt even get to the first dot on the dilators. She installed 15cm during surgery but when the packing came out there was only 8cm. Is 8cm enough for penetrative sex?

That&#39;s a big lie. I was told the same lie when vaginoplasty went wrong by Dr. O&#39;Brien Coon. I had vaginoplasty revision in December with Dr Ramineni so now I have 5 1/2 inches depth

I waited 4 weeks for this appointment just to discuss a depth revision. She knew that too. Then came in guns blazing about how adequate the depth it and how it‚Äôs more than enough for penetrative sex.

Wish you good luck with your revision know the feeling of trying to have vaginal sex and not being able to. I think anything more than 5 inches is great depth for sex

So I have to find another surgeon? Which means I have to travel out of state. I don‚Äôt have the freedom and readily ability to do that. What the fuck though. How could 3‚Äù be justifiable enough for penetrative sex to her? What am I missing.

Doctor didn&#39;t do a good job. Most surgeons are just butchers trying to make really good money offering surgeries they don&#39;t have much knowledge of. Hopefully you make a good decision this time.

I don‚Äôt think I made a bad decision the first time just because I got unlucky with depth. The visual results are nice. Depth is a failure

Ok that&#39;s your decision. I did the mistake of trusting the same doctor who did 4 failed revisions. Sorry if my comments are bothering you
