[NSFW] 13 days post - OP with Dr. Sutin from PAI in Bangkok! Everything is still incredibly swollen and I&#39;ve had a bit of a tear, but I&#39;m very happy with the results and the care I&#39;ve received, so far! (Day 7 &amp; 4 in pic 3 and 4)

Thank you very much! Yes, I&#39;m also incredibly happy with the result so far! Especially aesthetically Dr. Sutin has very consistently good looking results, one of the main reasons why I chose him and I feel like he did a great job :)

Yep! Classic penile inversion with a scrotal skin graft! Was able to get the catheter out on day 7, urination has been working well since, without any problems and dilation has been a bit physically exhausting and uncomfortable, but not downright painful. Doing 2x a day for 30min at the moment which is very managable.

Wow this is so interesting, I had surgery with Dr. Burin a few weeks ago, had the catheter out on day 5 and only have to dilate for 15 minutes twice a day. How long were you in the hospital? I‚Äôm not sure if these are individual differences or if these are some of the ways they differ as surgeons.

I feel like it&#39;s mostly individual difference. I stayed in the hospital for 5 days, the catheter just stayed in til day 7 because I had some stronger swelling.  Regarding dilation that&#39;s just what Dr. Sutin advised for me, I have another consultation tomorrow however, where I intend to get some more questions answered!

Sutin is one of the best vaginoplasty surgeons in the world.  I hope to have surgery soon with him.

I agree! I&#39;m sooo happy with the result and I have to say the care of Dr. Sutin, PAI and the hospital has been incredible. Couldn&#39;t be happier with my choice

It looks very good, I am shocked that it is the PI technique, it is the best result I have seen of that technique (seriously) despite having so little time, he did a very good job with your labia minora and cl√≠toris, I hope mine looks just as good like yours.

Beyond that, I have some questions about your experience with Dr. Sutin (I hope I can have my SRS with him soon): How has your recovery been so far? How was the unpacking process and the catheter? How is urination going? How are you managing the dilation process? How is your vaginal depth? How was your consultation with Dr. Sutin? Do you plan to make updates? (It would be very helpful), I hope you have an excellent recovery.

Hey! Thank you very much :)
</p>
<p>
From my experience over the last 14 days he and PAI were absolutely fantastic! Felt very well taken care off and they really organized everything for me. The hospital staff at Pyathai 2 was great as well! It&#39;s an incredibly modern and advanced hospital and had a private nurse, so that&#39;s been perfect! My recovery has been going pretty smoothly! The only annoyance I&#39;ve had was with the tear on my left labia majora, but that&#39;s been easy to deal with and mostly my fault. It&#39;s small, healing well and doesn&#39;t need treatment! Other than that I&#39;m feeling pretty great again already and am going to go back home on the 29th.
</p>
<p>
The unpacking was uncomfortable, but that was to be expected üòÖ You survive it, though. Catheter got taken out on day 7, as I had some stronger swelling in the beginning. Urination has been working very well since then though :) The dilation process is mostly just a bit uncomfortable and hurts a tiny bit, but then again that was to be expected. I dilate for 30min, 2 times a day (morning and evening) right now and douche afterwards! That works well enough to keep everything clean. Vaginal depth is at 6&#34; right now, which I&#39;m happy with.
</p>
<p>
The consultation with him was very thorough! He explains his technique in great detail and shows plenty of results of his as examples, all of which looked very, very good! + he and his assistants are incredibly sweet and kind, so it&#39;s easy to feel comfortable and at home at PAI and with him. It&#39;s also very easy to always keep in contact with them and if I had concerns or questions I usually received very quick answers per mail or WhatsApp. Usually within at max. 2 hours.
</p>
<p>
Price was at 8220‚Ç¨ for the SRS and tests, etc. + another 104‚Ç¨ for 2 psychiatrists letters I needed to get.
</p>
<p>
Together with hotel costs, days before and my own expenses that didn&#39;t have anything to do with the surgery my total for this trip is at roughly 12k‚Ç¨.
</p>
<p>
I plan to keep making updates! Probably again at the 1 month mark :)
</p>
<p>
Overall this has been a great experience for me and I couldn&#39;t be more satisfied. Dr. Sutin and his team have been amazing and I love my result. I can definitely recommend him.
</p>
<p>
SRS of course isn&#39;t a cakewalk and this has been the most challenging experience of my life, but it&#39;s been 100% worth it so far for me and I couldn&#39;t be more happy with my decision and I&#39;m very, very glad I went with him. Him and PAI made me feel very safe throughout all of it.

<p>
Paid 8,220‚Ç¨ for all surgery related expenses as a one time payment towards PAI + 104‚Ç¨ for 2 mandatory psychiatrist evaluations I had to do in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
Everything else was costs that were variable. I spent a total of 12k‚Ç¨ for the entirety of it all. But I also booked a very luxurious 5 star hotel, went to michelin starred restaurants, bought souvenirs and gifts and indulged myself A LOT. I&#39;d say if you go for something more normal and try to budget it could&#39;ve easily been just 10k‚Ç¨, if not less. Thailand can be incredibly cheap if you feel comfortable making a few sacrifices in the comfort department.
