She&#39;s an angel! I&#39;m going to share a summary of my journal at some point too. Hopefully that helps.

She really does have one of the best bedside manners ive ever come across in a surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I know its not much to look at now, but this should heal into a really cisnormative aesthetic (she did a really good job with the labia). I think youll be really happy with the look after.
</p>
<p>
Just when the time comes make sure to be diligent about scar care.
</p>
<p>
Good luck with the rest of recover

Thank you so much! ðŸ˜Š

This is the result of penile inversion. My wait time was only around 8 months; my consultation was in May of 2019.

I think it looks great for only two weeks- some swelling, but definitely not excessive. If things carry on as they are now your labia minora are going to be perfectly natural.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m really curious to see how your clitoral hood turns out. It appears she put a great deal of effort into it, and it appears that effort has paid off. It looks great.

How much was the dr. bill Iâ€™m going to her soon and am trying to get a idea about cost. How long did she want you to stay off of work to heal.

My insurance (Anthem Blue Cross) covered the surgery completely. Otherwise it would have been a $50k operation (not even considering the operating facility costs, the hospital stay, or travel and lodging).
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not even listed as a recommendation anymore. She requires 3 months of healing before returning to work. Largely because I&#39;m not allowed to do anything more strenuous than walking during that time. I&#39;m also not allowed to lift/push/pull anything over 10 pounds. (As I&#39;ve recommended elsewhere, if you live in Cali, you should look into taking 12 weeks of medical leave and claim disability insurance.)
</p>
<p>
I have read that some people are able to return to desk jobs after 6 weeks (because they&#39;re able to sit properly again), but the restrictions on lifting and strenuous activities still apply for the remaining 7 weeks.

I live in nevada I got anthem blue cross too. So you literally didnâ€™t have any co payments or other cost Iâ€™m super amazed. Thank you for your wonderful feedback!

I had a $500 copay on the hospital stay. I have to pay the hotel and lodging up-front, but they reimburse up to $10k. Food is my biggest out-of-pocket expense.
</p>
<p>
Also please don&#39;t just assume it&#39;s the same coverage. I technically have Blue Cross of California DBA Anthem Blue Cross.
</p>
<p>
Please verify that your plan covers medically necessary transgender services as they do any other medically necessary service. I would hate to see you end up with $10&#39;s of thousands in medical fees just because they have similar names.

Omg I&#39;m really interested in going to her (for the pull through method she offers, though), but I have to see if I can fight Kaiser Medi-Cal to cover her. Idk if anyone can provide me much insight about that, but I really don&#39;t want to go through kaiser and only get the inversion method and end up saving up later to get the pull through as well. I&#39;m already going through kaiser and have been assigned a surgeon (Dr. Simonds), but I&#39;m still a ways off from having a date, so if I&#39;m able to get them to cover her, I would be fantastically happy about that

Thank you, and I really hope you&#39;re right. I keep seeing progress photos that jump from 1 or 2 weeks post-op to 3 or 6 months post-op, and it&#39;s really hard to imagine those changes in my own vagina. I hope I can share enough photos to give an idea of that in-between time.
