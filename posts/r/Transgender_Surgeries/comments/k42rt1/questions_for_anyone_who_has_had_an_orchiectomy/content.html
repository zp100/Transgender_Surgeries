Hi, if anyone here has undergone orchi, would they mind sharing their experiences?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Does having just an orchi make tucking a lot easier? Do you still have any trouble hiding everything post op?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did you undergo an orchiectomy procedure under the assumption that you wouldn&#39;t want full SRS?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Did having an orchi and therefore ceasing to produce testosterone have any effect on the rest of your body? I&#39;ve heard it has caused more feminisation and breast growth but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a myth or not
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks :)

I’ve had an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
1) It does make tucking much easier, but I do still need to tuck, which is kind of annoying (but no longer painful). I can achieve a pretty much perfect tuck now.
</p>
<p>
2) I’ll get SRS in 1-2 years, but there are long wait times where I live due to COVID-19, a shortage of qualified surgeons, and the cost/time needed for hair removal. It made sense to go ahead with an orchiectomy.
</p>
<p>
3) My testosterone was fully suppressed to a very low level beforehand, so I haven’t experienced any huge changes. I was able to lower my HRT dosage, which is better for health long term. My breasts are still growing in occasional spurts, so it’s impossible to say whether the rate of growth has changed. I suspect it did not.
</p>
<p>
I’d still do it again if I had to do it over, I think it was a good choice.

I&#39;d like to add, I want full srs as soon as I can, but having the ability to produce t whenever I can&#39;t access my hrt for whatever reason makes me feel terrified, they&#39;ve also been really painful. So I want to get rid of them, but I don&#39;t want to ruin my srs outcomes, is that what really happens with an orchiectomy?

I had an orchiectomy in early 2018.
</p>
<p>
1 - Tucking is now much easier without the testicles. However, some garments are still more difficult to tuck in (e.g. thongs)
</p>
<p>
2 - I got the orchiectomy with the anticipation of a future vaginoplasty and to avoid anti androgen side effects.
</p>
<p>
3 - My testosterone and estrogen are in the normal female range. I have noticed some additional breast growth but I don’t have historical measurements to confirm so it might be perception rather than reality. My skin feels thinner and my body hair is much lighter.
</p>
<p>
Overall, getting the orchiectomy was a good decision for me. I feel more female since the testicles were a major source of my own gender dysphoria.
