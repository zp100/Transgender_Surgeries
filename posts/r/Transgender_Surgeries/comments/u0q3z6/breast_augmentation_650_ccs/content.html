I would have never chose 650 ccs myself. I was hoping for no more than 500. I definitely stressed that I wanted natural looking but I wanted my moneys worth as well. Im just hoping this turns out to look ok because i never was interested in having the biggest breasts in the room. I went through the most pain the first two days. I could barely move and was looking to take my pain medication as soon as I could. Under the muscle definitely hurts!

If your experience is like mine, they will definitely drop a lot.  650cc under the muscle is a lot, but they may surprise you after you ae healed and drop.

At my preop i was just asked to provide pics of what i wanted and measurements were taken and plus he asked me what sort of projection i wanted. So i didnt find out it was 650 ccs he decided on until the day of surgery while he was marking me i asked

Yea. He started explaining to me how the volume compared to the width of my chest is something you have to consider. Ive seen other trans girls with less CCs. I think 500 or even 550 would have been ok

500 wouldn’t have been worth the out of pocket costs trust me. We have a similar frame from what I can see and 500 wouldn’t make u happy in the long run. Under the muscle reduces projection so trust me he made the right decision for u!

Sometimes larger implants look more natural. I’m very thin but still went with 500ccs and they look more natural than smaller ones. I don’t have the telltale large gap in between them that you get with smaller implants and they suit my frame more

Youre saying let you know if they drop/fluff? That whole process could take 4-6 months

Did your doctor pressure you into getting what they wanted instead of what you wanted for yourself? That&#39;s unethical

They didnt pressure me i thought he understood my goal though. I think he did another trans girl who wanted large breasts and had a smaller frame and so maybe thats the look he thought id want to go for. I didnt know he went for 650 until the day of surgery when he was marking me up. We never discussed ccs before then. I gave him pictures of my goal but hopefully his professional opinion works out

Hmm. Yea. I dunno. Are u worried theyre too big? And u should  talk to them now instead of waiting.I know they tend to go big because we have bigger chests and larger balances us out. Plus once they drop,  theyll look way different. Look on the web to see examples.Or ask them.

Had mine done back in October. To begin with I was so swollen and my chest felt ready to burst. 6 months later, with the swelling gone and the drop/fluff I&#39;m delighted with a natural look. Give the process time and fingers crossed you enjoy the result, hope it turns out like you wanted!

They will for sure drop and fluff nicely!!! Give them time, it won’t be overnight sis!!! I have 650 as well and I ended up a 36DD off the table… I am now a 36DDD/38DD since I have dropped, fluffed and grown in those 4 years.
</p>
<p>
Make sure u wear ur surgical bra for support and compression. Also get ready for some pretty intense pain as the nerves reconnect! Stay strong cuz I was in so much pain I regretted my BA and got a bit depressed. It will get better and be so worth  it 😃

My surgeon had a range of moderate/moderate+ implants picked out during preOP, but she said she was gonna choose the size based on what she saw in the OR(what my body  can handle and if they looked close to my goal). She ended up going with the smallest size on the list and they still looked HUGE for the first few days and I was scared they would stay that big(I was freaking out a bit)
</p>
<p>
After 10 days they have shrunk a bit and are softer and I love the size now and In a few months they will look even better. Be patient and see how they turn out, of you don&#39;t like them by 3-6months can always do revision for smaller

Nice. I got 750cc. I was originally going with 650cc but decided to do 750 at my preop.
</p>
<p>
Mine look very much similar just a bit bigger. Mine still have to settle as well.

I got 685/640cc under the muscle 10 days ago. I&#39;m 5&#39;11&#34; 170lbs. It&#39;s going to take awhile for the swelling to dissipate, but they&#39;re going to look great.

They just don&#39;t look like under the muscle at all to me.  I&#39;m a nurse, and trans and I&#39;ve seen my share of a lot of BAs.  The top part of the implants appear to push out a lot more than they should.
</p>
<p>
I do so hope they drop and fluff out.  What kind of implants are they?  Tear drop?  Smooth?
</p>
<p>
For example, mine were smooth Mentors, 425ccs, medium profile to fit my size, over the muscle - and aside from the scar I have from the keloids/hypertrophics (I generate hyper amounts of collagen when using dissolvable stitches in my dermis), very natural looking now.

Oh wow. I know when I asked him what plane he was inserting the implant in, he said under the muscle. And the first 3-4 days were tremendously painful to lay up or move much. I kept imagining a bear had clawed my chest off at times.
</p>
<p>
Thanks so much i hope so too. He used Natrelle Inspira Softtouch SSF 650cc implants so i believe smooth and round.
</p>
<p>
I have a feeling my doctor may not work on as many transgender women as he suggested. I always hear all these other trans women say they had much less volume in CCs that fit their frame but for some reason he thought i needed something so high to get a good result because of my frame? Im 5’5” and medium build. He could have done way less than 650cc and it irritates me a bit but hopefully at the end of this i get some big pretty tits that are somewhat natural looking at least.

If they don&#39;t fit what you wanted when they drop and fluff by month 3 - 6 - go back to him and see if you can get a no-charge revision.

I&#39;m over 6 feet tall and I only had 425s.

The paperwork i signed states that any revisions he may or may not waive surgeons fee but you still have to pay anesthesia and hospital fee either way. I dont even have the money for that. This was supposed to be a one stop shop you know. Plus i have other surgeries i plan to get. Im just a little down but im hoping it turns out ok

Ice them, rest up, apply your oils/ creams/ gels when you’re able to (they help with stretch marks) and always wear your medical/ sports bra. They’ll definitely look more natural in the coming months. Mine started to look more natural around month 3 and now I’m over 1 year post op BA. Best of luck!

I am sure once the swelling is gone everything settles a bit, you will be more than happy. I am dreaming myself of BA and I definitly want to have my boobies visible, so at least 700 or so.

They look great so far! In a couple of weeks they’ll drop more and look more natural. I’m over 2 months postop from 500ccs and they get better every week. Take it easy and focus on healing love ❤️

They look great and will surely look even better once they drop and fluff.

Thanks for the reply.   I had not gone and looked at your other posts.
</p>
<p>
Your before size is pretty similar to mine.  I&#39;m scheduled for my BA mid-May.
<br>
Your before and after posts have been VERY helpful and give me some idea of what I can expect.  Thank you for posting your results.

Wear a strap over them in order to help pull them down and don&#39;t take off your bra

All you need is an ace bandage and then you can mimic this band

I only got 375 and I wish I would have gotten more.  My chest and shoulders are so big I have had CIS women argue with me that they are not 40D as they measure.  I had a mastopexy at the same time and my surgeon says that it would have been too dangerous to go bigger, but I can’t help but feel like I will have to drop more money and get a bigger size in a year ☹️.  I am sure once they drop you will be very happy!
