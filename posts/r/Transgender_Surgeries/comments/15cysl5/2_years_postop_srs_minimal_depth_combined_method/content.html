I initially planned to post a 1 year update but then I kind of forgot, oh well :D
</p>
<p>
So yeah, overall pretty happy with my result, keep in mind that it was meant to be a 2 stage surgery, so some slight &#39;imperfections&#39; were to be expected. If you compare it to my previous post you can see how much hidden swelling there still was but now that it is gone there is quite a bit of extra skin for my labias which creates a bit of a shapeless transition between the minoras and majoras. And it also creates some wrinkles. Additionally there is also still too much erectile tissue which does not look too great when aroused. And the angle of my urethra could also be a bit better. Lastly I also have a weird issue when it comes to orgasms. While they do work just fine and the sensation is great, they do result in a slight burning sensation on the right side of my body around where the lingual canal is. My guess is that something did not heal properly so I would like to have that checked out when I do have a correction one day.As of right now my personal life does not allow me to get it just yet but once I do have the revision I will post another update. So yeah, if you happen to have any questions, feel free to ask. :)

This looks great. I am planning a minimal depth procedure in six months and very much looking forward to it.

Meaning that the internal vaginal cavity will extend only 1-3 inches inward. It is for women that aren’t concerned about vaginal penetrative sex, don’t want to dilate, want a shorter recovery, want a decreased risk of complications, or all of that. Some dilation and flexibility in results is optional depending on surgeon.

your mileage may obviously vary, but 2 weeks after surgery I was completely off of painmeds (obviously there was still some pain but it was very much manageable)

Yes I am. During the whole experience of going through the surgery I always felt taken care of and the few points I would like to have a revision on are due to the fact that it was meant to be a 2 part surgery in the first place.

Does the erectile tissue feel nice when aroused? I think your results are beautiful.

That is honestly not a super easy question to answer. On the one hand it is the tissue that, like the name says, was responsible for the erection of the penis. So there is some sexual aspect to it. But on the other hand, it swelling up does also affect the vaginal canal which complicates things. But it does not hurt or anything if that&#39;s what you wanted to know.
