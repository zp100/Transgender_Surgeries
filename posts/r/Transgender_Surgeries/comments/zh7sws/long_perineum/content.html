I am 3 months post op and my perineum is also about 8-9 cm long. The only potential draw back is that it may make doggy style sex difficult or impossible depending on your partners penile length if you engage in penis/vagina sex. My husband and I have not attempted doggy style yet because of some minor dehiscence I still have, but I don‚Äôt think we are going to be able to. While I will miss that position for sure, I still can and very much enjoy being on top and missionary. Having the longer perineum has not interrupted any other function or the aesthetics of my vulva/vagina. It would be nice if it were perfect, but nothing is and I love my new equipment FAR more than the original setup.

So I&#39;m pre op but my perineum is pretty long too, to the point where men I&#39;ve been with have commented on my butthole not being where they expect it to be. I think mine actually might be longer than yours. I&#39;ve actually asked my doctor about it, wondering if it might be related to my GI issues (I&#39;m chronically ill, I have no shame left I just ask the weirdo questions lol) and apparently that&#39;s just normal anatomical variation!
</p>
<p>
In other words, shouldn&#39;t affect the ~passability~ of your results or anything. Just happens naturally sometimes.

Well I&#39;ve got musculoskeletal issues, a seizure disorder, and a few other issues that keep me going back and forth to different doctors when I can afford it, but like I said, I&#39;m pre op, so I haven&#39;t dealt with that specific issue yet. I just have a long taint. üíÄ

I forgot to mention.. maybe you would be interested. Only thing I found was you can shorten perineum by pelvic floor exercises.

You might be able to gain a but of depth early in if you make a big effort, but it won‚Äôt be long term and not a huge amount. There‚Äôs some info in the wiki here.
</p>
<p>
The perinium sounds unusual, not sure I‚Äôve heard of that much before.
</p>
<p>
Would you mind saying who your surgeon is?
