I guess I have to admit dysphoria might be lying to me. I have a very hard time taking compliments both on my current face and future. But thank you for the feedback!

So I got a virtual ffs (photoshoped pics by person who knows a lot about faces). And I was hoping for some opinions on the results. They are made based on what can be expected from Facial team in Marbelle. My personal thoughts on the pictures are mixed. When I look at each individual change I can see they make my face look more feminine. But when I look at the picture with all the changes I still don&#39;t think I pass as a woman. How much of that is the slight beard shadow, bad hair and bushy eyebrows I don&#39;t know but it leaves me a bit scared. Im at 9 months Hrt.
<br>
Now although the pictures where a bit expensive, its a smaller price to pay compared to the surgery itself. The fact that it lets me know what I&#39;m walking into, lets me not be overly ambitious and lets me be relaxed during the healing knowing how much I can expect the swelling to go down, makes it worth it.
<br>
People often say facial team doesn&#39;t make very dramatic changes but it looks quite significant to me at least from the virtual ffs. And yet still not enough? But yeah what are you peoples opinion on these &#34;results&#34;?

I personally think you look good and fairly passing in the unedited pictures, but I really think the edited shots look great. And I think frequently the ffs results I&#39;ve seen can tend to be even a bit more significant of a change. Idk I think you look great both ways.

I don&#39;t have any medical expertise and don&#39;t know what extent is actually possible but I pushed one of your pics a bit further

How did you do that? As in, what surgical procedures would be necessary to achieve results like these?

I used Photoshop. I&#39;m not sure what procedures would be needed exactly or if they would be medically possible. I changed the jaw and chin a bit, lowered the hairline, and changed the distance between upper lip and nose. All of those things can be done surgically, but like I mentioned I don&#39;t know if they can to that extent.

I could give it a go if you want. I can&#39;t make any promises that the results will be surgically possible though. I&#39;m an artist not a doctor üòÖ

I‚Äôm going to Facialteam next month and had the same virtual work done.   My goal:  feel better about how I look in the mirror.  As for passing, I think I have made my peace with standing out a bit.  I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù tall, so no matter what, I‚Äôm going to stand out, especially in heels.  And you bet I‚Äôm still going to wear those heels.
</p>
<p>
And facial team does tend to be a little more natural/ conservative in their approach, but I‚Äôd rather that than some of the overdone stuff I‚Äôve seen.  You can always enhance with fillers/ etc. later.  But I think it‚Äôs a lot harder to walk back an aggressive FFS that gives you an outcome you didn‚Äôt want.

Did you use an app on your phone or Photoshop? /Gimp? I&#39;ve been experimenting with gimp and the warp transform is pretty powerful
