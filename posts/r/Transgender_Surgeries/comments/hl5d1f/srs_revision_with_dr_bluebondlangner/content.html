<p>
I am now 30 days post-op from undergoing a peritoneal graft revision to my  original SRS done in  2018, and I thought I would pass along my experience.
</p>
<p>
On June 4th I reported to the NYU Langone Kimmell Pavillion around 0630 for admission. It&#39;s a beautiful hospital. Two years old and ultra-modern. I was taken back to a staging area where you  change into a  hospital gown and get your vitals taken. Drs. Zhao and Bluebond-Langner stopped by around 0730 and confirmed I was ready. We also discussed again why she didn&#39;t think the labiaplasty  I wanted was a good idea, specifically mentioning a  significant chance for a &#34;poor outcome&#34;, referring to the possibility of tissue necrosis and fat resorption.  So, no designer pussy for me.
</p>
<p>
Shortly thereafter, I got in a wheelchair and was taken to the doors of the OR. The doors opened, and the nurse said, &#34;Walk in as directed, please. The OR was packed with video monitors and equipment. They guided me around the equipment to the table and asked me to hop on.  I did so and they positioned me just so and then started my IV while I studied the ceiling.  They gave me something, I don&#39;t know what, but I could feel it, and he last thing I remember was  &#34;You&#39;ll be asleep shortly&#34;.  I found out later the surgery took five hours. It was marked on a bracelet on my wrist.
</p>
<p>
In the PACU I woke up to intense bladder pain.  (Note:  I am sure this was particular to my surgery, so anyone reading this, I highly doubt you will experience this.   I had vaginal stenosis because of a childhood surgery on my bladder that left a lot of internal scarring and adhesions.  The essential part of my revision was to dissect away the bladder wall from the adhesions using robotic microsurgery.  The pain was from trauma to the bladder.)  In any event after some morphine and fentanyl, the pain was controlled and I was taken to my room.
</p>
<p>
At Kimmel Pavilion, all the rooms are private rooms with giant flat-screen monitors and arm-mounted tablets by your bed to control the lighting and window blinds, order your meals, watch TV, etc.  I didn&#39;t really care about any of that. I was in a lot of pain, because somehow there was an eight-hour gap between the PACU and getting my pain meds around midnight.
</p>
<p>
For the next five days, I had a constant sensation of needing to pee. The surgical residents kept telling me that was from the foley catheter, but I know it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;ve had SRS before. I&#39;ve had a foley catheter for five days before. This definitely was not that.  They kept bringing me food I didn&#39;t want. I just couldn&#39;t eat. Anyway, on day three they wanted me out of bed to sit in a recliner. Why a recliner I have no idea. It was torture after an hour or so, but I gutted out four hours. Again, they insisted I eat.  They wanted me to have a bowel movement.  So finally I ate something, and I had awful stomach pains. I made it to the toilet later and shit copious amounts of bright red blood and some reddish-black glop, but afterwards I felt significantly better.
</p>
<p>
Day four was about getting out of bed and walking around the hospital floor.  It was not difficult and I welcomed being out of bed.  By then the pain was pretty manageable. I should mention that the laparoscopy scars - one above my belly button, and one near my left bikini line - didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was very surprised by that.
</p>
<p>
Day five was discharge day. Drs. RBL and Zhao came by, and Dr. Zhao started to remove the packing.  I had gone through this before, and it felt much the same, weird but not painful - until the last few seconds . OMFG I thought they were pulling my intestines out. Thankfully it was over quickly.  Unfortunately the catheter stayed in. Dr. Zhao said that was SOP for revisions.  As to why, I never got a good answer. I also was asked to dilate like 30 minutes later - starting with the green dilator.  Amazingingly, I got it in without much pain, past the last dot, half-way to the notch.  That&#39;s like six inches.  I was astounded. I had struggled for two years with 3 1/2 inches of depth.  I just kept looking down at the dilator buried in my snatch and I was so happy.
</p>
<p>
A girlfriend of mine came up from Philly and got me out of the hospital.  They give you a
<em>
ton
</em>
of stuff, like five big bags of supplies.  The first Uber wouldn&#39;t even take us because we had so much stuff. I spent the next week at a nearby hotel.  I dilated with only the green dilator for a while, but it started getting painful, and Kevin, the  patient coordinator, told me to step down to the blue, then try the green. That worked better.
</p>
<p>
After one week, I had my first follow-up, and they took out the catheter.  It popped right out. What a relief!   The second follow-up was one week after that and Dr. RBL said everything looked great. I even got a picture of the inside of my vagina, lol.  It&#39;s pink and moist. I kidded with her that I was happy but I didn&#39;t get my designer pussy, with her initials tattooed on one of the labia.  She said, &#34;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re still upset about that, I think your vagina looks great.&#34; I was somewhat mollified. I don&#39;t think it looks great, but I guess we are all our own worst critics.
</p>
<p>
At the four-week mark I finally worked up the nerve to try the orange monster.  It was not easy, but I got it in to the last dot.  That&#39;s 5 1/2 inches of depth with the orange, whereas I could barely get to the first dot with a blue dilator before the surgery. I would have to say the surgery was a complete success.

Thank you for sharing. I’m happy for you that everything worked out! 😃
</p>
<p>
Edit: Can I ask who did the original surgery? Out of curiosity.

Thanks. She was my #2 choice. Obviously not saying it’s her fault that you needed a revision, but it’s good to keep in the back of my mind.

I definitely don&#39;t blame Dr. McGinn. She had no idea about the adhesions until she opened me up. I came out of surgery with 4 1/2 inches, but it slowly closed up despite regular dilation.  Just my bad luck about a pre-existing condition..

Sorry that happened to you. I’m glad you could it taken care of though!

Dr. McGinn has a great rep. That’s why she’s still my #2 choice.

I also want to thank you for sharing all of this because McGinn and Bluebond are really my only choices thus far, coincidentally. I just put in requests for consultations with both of them yesterday.

Can you add some more detail on this point?  Right now I am choosing McGinn over Bluebond-Langner purely because of the aesthetics that McGinn seems to consistently be able to do.

I think my labia majora are too thin, and I gape when I spread my legs.  You can kind of see that

(Warning: NSFW)  I have to admit that if RBL is complimenting Dr. McGinn&#39;s work, it&#39;s probably me whose perspective is off.

Thank you!  The way you were wording it made it sound like some of the bad results that get posted now and then, but it looks great, well within the normal results.
</p>
<p>
For the lerker readers Bowers seems to be known to produce a more &#34;fat&#34; labia major in her typical results

Congratulations on your revision. Dr. RBbL is one of the best in the business. From what you posted, you’ve had a great outcome. I’m very happy for you❣️
</p>
<p>
I simply cannot thank you enough for the detailed post. I now have a clearer mental image of what is ahead of me. (I see Dr. RBbL next week for the physical portion of my consult). Thanks to you, a smidge of anxiety has come off.
</p>
<p>
Btw, I consulted w/Dr. McGinn the end of last month for my BA and TS, while there for my genital electrolysis appointment. It’s a top notch facility and fantastic caring staff. Gaia Guest House is a great place as well. 🤗s

Thank you, and you are very welcome.  These are serious medical procedures and can be very scary, simply because it&#39;s hard to know what to expect.  Whether you go with McGinn or RBL, I can assure you that you will be in excellent hands, and will get top-notch medical care.  I agree that RBL and McGinn are two of the best in the business. I was very lucky to have had both of them as my surgeons.  And yes, Gaia House was wonderful!

Did you orginally have PPT vaginoplasty with Dr. Mcginn? What was the process like to get Dr. RBL to do your revision surgery (insurance, cost, referral, consultation) and how did you decide on PPT?

Yes. However Dr. McGinn does not offer PPT vaginoplasty. I had her penile inversion procedure done.  I first contacted Dr. RBL I think in July or August of 2018, and got a consultation in October. I was contemplating having another cosmetic procedure done in December (which got canceled), so she asked me to come back in January 2019. It was at that point I got a surgery date for March 2020 (which got rescheduled to June due to COVID).
</p>
<p>
Dr. RBL was in-network for me, so all office visits were the standard co-pay of $45 (I use Aetna). There was no referral required, and of course I didn&#39;t need any letters or what not since I was more than a year post-op by then.
</p>
<p>
My out-of-pocket cost for the surgery was $2800 (20% of about $14,000).  The actual price of the procedure is a mystery to me, since my Explanation of Benefits from Aetna says the hospital billed them $30K. In any event the total cost to me, including air fares and hotel bookings was a little over $5K.  The follow-up visits are done at no charge, you just have to show up at the clinic.
</p>
<p>
PPT was the perfect procedure for me. It uses the existing neovagina skin graft; it gives extra depth and width without needing external donor tissue (like thigh or abdomen), and it is a mucosal tissue that gradually undergoes metaplasia to tissue that it is indistinguishable from natal vaginal endothelium. As such it will keep the pH of my neovagina lower (by hosting lactobaccilus, which is good for vaginal health) and the continual secretions help keep the neovagina clean (just like a natal vaginal).
</p>
<p>
As far as the claim about needing less dilation, we shall see. Right now I am on a dilation schedule identical to RBL&#39;s initial vaginoplasty protocol. She does a hybrid peritoneal graft/penile inversion technique, so a revision ends up being exactly the same result - penile/scrotal skin for the labia and introitus, and peritoneal tissue for the posterior portion of the neovagina. One other advantage s the peritoneal flap is anchored to the peritoneal wall, so it has much less likelihood of prolapse.
</p>
<p>
So far, I am very happy with the results and would recommend Drs. Zhao and Bluebond-Langner to anyone.

It just is. It&#39;s hard to grasp the PoV, but this is a picture of the inside of my vagina taken through an illuminated speculum by Dr. RBL:
