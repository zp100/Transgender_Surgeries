Ahhh you look so good!! Your profile is incredible üòç I‚Äôm scheduled with Dr Mardirossian in December. How was your experience with everything outside of insurance battles? Did you have conversations about what you wanted specifically or was it more led by Dr M?

Thank you, he did a great job!
</p>
<p>
I really like him; he&#39;s pretty funny/personable, though a little awkward, and he&#39;s definitely super competent. I had heard that he was pretty conservative in his surgical approach and that&#39;s more or less what I wanted. I kind of just let him take the reigns after I told him what I was looking for (me, but more femme, and I feel like he delivered.)
</p>
<p>
VHC was fine, it&#39;s a really nice hospital and the staff were good about pronouns/making me feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m a little upset about my trach shave. I&#39;m 33 and most of it has ossified at this point. He did as much as he could safely do, I just still have more of a lump than I was hoping for, but it&#39;s definitely better.
</p>
<p>
The first week/2 weeks of recovery were pretty rough, and I kept thinking to myself &#34;why did I do this, what have I done, I look awful, It&#39;s never going to get better&#34; but after week 3-4 I started to notice a pretty drastic improvement in the swelling.

I had surgery on 9/9/22 with Dr. Vartan Mardirossian. Healing has been going well, my only complaints are that the scars in my mouth make opening my mouth all the way kind of difficult. The first 3 pictures are post, taken this morning. The other 2 are from July and March respectively. I lost my phone on my way to VA to have the surgery and cant find a more recent  picture in profile.
</p>
<p>
Happy to answer any questions or discuss what my process was like. I was going through Starbucks, so there wasn&#39;t a ton of legwork on my end, but can still talk about my experience with the logistics I did have to navigate. Hope this can be helpful for others in the process.

Thank you! You&#39;ve given me encouragement. Just now I&#39;m 30 days post FFS with a different Dr. Your timelines for the emotional shifts are right on target for me too. I&#39;ve kinda spent the last 30 days in regret, but now starting to see my real facial features as it settles in. It gives me enormous comfort to know that my next two weeks will continue to be revealing and help me get out of my regret funk. And you&#39;re results are amazing, so Enjoy your Best Life!!!

It was a wild ride. I heard a lot of stories that I understood as people immediately seeing themselves and being so joyous. Maybe they meant a month or so down the line, because it was rough when the bandage was first removed. I was so swollen and bruised and the cheek implants hadn&#39;t softened yet. I felt like a movie monster from a B horror flick; all plastic and latex and swollen like a puffer fish.
</p>
<p>
It has gotten much better and my confidence/self-esteem has improved a ton. Just hold on ü§óüíó

Now THIS is a beautiful forehead for sure. Type 3 in all its glory. Mardi is truly an amazing surgeon. Too many surgeons(unqualified for facial bone work) out there Prey on poor and desperate transgirls and give them pretty shitty results. Glad you got a beautiful outcome, girly! Enjoy your beautiful face !

What work did you have done? Your eyes are so much bigger and brighter and I worry that‚Äôs due to a blepharoplasty since my insurance won‚Äôt cover that specific ffs procedure ü•≤

I had forehead contouring and scalp advancement, chin and mandible contouring, cheek implants, rhinoplasty and trach shave. No blepharoplasty, I didn&#39;t really notice a change in my eye shape or size, so I think it might just be lighting/angle of the photo? Or, having my brow bossing eliminated has &#34;opened&#34; my eyes up some? Good luck to you, and stay optimistic through the recovery. The recovery was rough emotionally for the first couple of weeks.

Rule 9. No sexual complements.
</p>
<p>
No sexually suggestive compliments or comments that may be interpreted that way. Examples: - Nice - Daddy - Looks hot - Gorgeous
</p>
<p>
This is a surgery sub so lets keep comments clinical.

My consult was just around the start of April. So it was right around 4 months before surgery. My insurance didn&#39;t go active through Sbux until July, and it seems like that held up scheduling a bit. It took them about 6 weeks before they could get prior authorization, so that was mid August.

Does he offer financial plans ? I understand these procedures vary in price and depending on what the patient needs but I trying to see if I can realistically afford doing anything with respects to FFS
