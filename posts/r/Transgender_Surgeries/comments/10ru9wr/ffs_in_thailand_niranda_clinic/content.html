Hi
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been looking around for FFS in Thailand and had some virtual consults and one two in person. Every consult has listed jaw recountouring.
</p>
<p>
The first is with Dr. Parin Tatsanavivat at the in Bangkok for a lip lift as he has good reviews and has done many. And the second with Dr poonpissamai suwajo, m.d. at for FFS and the bone work. First via email via their staff. She first adviced a Forhead countouring, brow lift and then rhinoplasty in 6 months as i was having the lip lift. For the lower part of the face she adviced a Mandible reduction and Genioplasty.
</p>
<p>
When i went in for a consult and meet her she says my lower face is almost perfect. She would only take very little. I mention that i wish for my chin to come up a little to have better harmony with my lip lift as my lip to philtrum and chin ratio but she also said it would accentuate the grove you have in your chin a lot so i might need fillers. So hearing this i&#39;ve decided to just do the upper face and the rhino in 6 months when my lip has healed. I think i will do a fat transfer to my lower lip or a tissue graft (from hairline lowering cutout ) at the same time as the FFS if possible. My proportions for this area before surgery is close to perfect so i wish to preserve it as much as i can. If anyone has experience with taking tissue and doing a implant at the same time as hair lowering i&#39;d love to hear about it.
</p>
<p>
While i do not know her exact FFS experience she has been under Dr. suporn for SRS ( Which i believe is her main interest ) and teach plastic surgery so i think i am in fairly good hands. The consult and experience with their staff was very good. She also cares a lot abpout transgender people in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to price its very fair. They advertise for 3 procedures in 1 incision on the clinic (its done at Phaya thai hospital with one night and tests) so you get.
</p>
<p>
Forehead reduction and contouring 230,000 THB (Hairline Advancement, Browlift, and Contouring the Underlying Bone)
</p>
<p>
Angle mandible reduction 230,000 THB - 10% = 207,000 THB I assume jaw contouring is incl.
</p>
<p>
Upper lip lifting 45,000 THB - 10% = 40,500 THB I pay 40 000 with Dr parin for this
</p>
<p>
Genioplasty 70,000 THB - 10% = 63,000 THB
</p>
<p>
I also talked with Kamol hospital but they are on average 20-30k above in prices which isnt that bad but they wanted 75 000 for a lip lift. I feel that price is rather high. I do not know their package prices as things were listed seperatly.
</p>
<p>
Its going to be about 3-4 weeks before i go into the major surgery (Sorry!) but i&#39;ll share my experience along the way. Maybe she is undiscovered gem for FFS for us from abroad. It will take about a year to be fully healed of course.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to comment if you have had any experience with Niranda clinic.
</p>
<p>
Edit and update 8 months after.
</p>
<p>
Well its been about 8 months now and im really not happy with the result. I felt it right away for one part and wonder what the heck they had done there. And now the setback they have made has left a large vertical indent in my forhead that is quite visible as there is not underlying bone there in the transition. Under one eyebrow i can feel a big notch in there but thankfully not visible. Between the eyebrows i now have a permanent wrinkle due to laxed skin. I would never go there again for FFS, She is great on SRS but FFS i&#39;d never do with her again. Im just happy they choose to ignore me after i left and didnt send me before and after pics of FFS Rhinoplasty&#39;s

Had my lip lift 2 days ago and its the first time I&#39;ve actually seen a woman looking back at me in the mirror. It was emotional. Dosent look good now and not quite happy but I have to wait for the final result. Feeling like a bunny! Lol! The surgery was painless and  2 paracetamol in the evening was all I needed. Great surgeon and team

Guess its time for an update.
</p>
<p>
Its been 3 weeks since surgery now and it went quite well. I had a complication but it was handled at the hospital but took a few weeks to heal while we keept an eye on it.  Its a little soon to see the results but it looks good so far. I did ask her to be agressive but she responded with the brain is back there. She did a good job though and i havent had any issues and so far the scar does not itch at all.  She advanced the hairline about 1 cm. She also closed up my temples nicely. The insicion was done as a straight cut with no waves in it like i see some surgeons do. Cant remember if its to break up the scar a bit or for a more natural hairline.  Recovery was very easy with just tylenol from the second until the 5th day and after that i havent had any pain.
</p>
<p>
I do feel that i should have been given a bit more instructions for aftercare. I was just told not to blow my nose but no information of when i can do so. Im a very timid and shy person so i forget to ask cause im nervous and i feel like things were a little rushed. So make sure you ask.
</p>
<p>
The bad things.  I asked if there would be a CT scan several days before surgery and the staff said yes. I also asked if i would see her again before surgery which they said yes to. There was no CT scan, just an X ray 1h before surgery.  I only got to see her on my way in for surgery for 2 min or so. I wanted to go over final thoughts with her so she could plan for it but didnt have a chance to do so. I can to a certain extend understand this but it was poorly conveied. I though we would have a final meeting before going in.
</p>
<p>
I may also do a rhinoplasty with her but im waiting for before and after pics before i allow her to do so. One of the staff also mentioned that it may be better to use someone else that i forgot the name of while another staff says to go with the same doctor.  So its hard to say but i put more trust in the first staff member who was the one that came with me to arrange everything at the hospital. It&#39;s somewhat unproffessional and with the lack of a CT scan when they said there would be and the poorly conveied info about seeing her before surgery my trust in them isnt at the highest. I trust her as a surgeon but not the staff to give me all the correct information.
</p>
<p>
Another thing to mention is that i asked their international coordinator via email about The Dr. experience with rhinoplasty. She then quoted me the general information i could find online myself.  So i asked again and mentioned that the nose is a speciality item and i&#39;d like to know aprox how many cases she has and her experience with this. The reply i got was that they did not count the cases and that she had over 20 years experience and that she was teaching at the university. That didnt tell me anything. Im sure the Dr has a rough overview of her rhinoplasty/ffs cases and if she is experienced with it. Her main work has been SRS for many years. I also asked to see before and after pictures in the same inquiry but i never got an answer to that. Perhaps she forgot about it. There&#39;s been a couple of other things she forgot about too.  To be honest I got the feeling that i was just being a nuisance so i told her. Ok thank you you have been very helpful and left it there.  In general she is quite helpful but this part was not a good experience. I should have asked a lot more in the initial consulation with the Dr and not via email later.
</p>
<p>
Il post some pictures later soon.
