Been a while since I&#39;ve posted an update, but a few months back I&#39;d mentioned I&#39;d begun losing depth after grs.  Well even with dilation (I&#39;m doing 2 to 3x a day still) it&#39;s continued to happen and it&#39;s been over a year and a half now.  But pretty much around 6 months after surgery I was at the largest orange dilator with all the dots gone,  and now I can&#39;t get larger than green and I&#39;ve got 4 dots visible.  I have yet to discuss this with Dr Pang, so I don&#39;t know if this is reversible or will I need a revision if I want my depth back or what even caused it.  But I wanted to provide this as a small update as it may be something someone needs to hear.  Also if this has happened to anyone else please let me know if you managed to resolve a similar issue and how or if it just continued getting worse.

Thank you very much for your candor in this.  Losing depth and needing revisions at all give me a lot of pause.  But, we wouldn&#39;t know if people didn&#39;t speak up.  Thank you.

Yeah the idea of having to go through everything all over again,  and still run the risk of this happening all over is absolutely depressing.

Update,  attempting to contact Dr Pang and his email is no longer working.  I emailed his PA Jim to see if there&#39;s a way to get in contact with Dr Pang and to see what they&#39;d suggest.  But from what I gather is he may no longer be at Mt Sinai which between that and the loss of Depth I&#39;m rather emotionally devestated.

It may be an option to discuss it with another surgeon at Mount Sinai.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/fyrxcn/dilation_tips_to_maximise_depth/fn58xeb/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/posts/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/go274u/succesful_attempt_at_gaining_depth/content.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>
might be some hints concerning depth.
</p>
<p>
And a number of people said pelvic floor training may also be helpful.

may be more.
</p>
<p>
And it may be an idea to make some photos, and ask a few surgeons. A number of surgeons do revisions, or they may be able to give some hints.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/b6j2nu/post_op_trans_women_dont_deserve_to_be_ignored/ejlj9iu/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>
may be more, and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/europe#wiki_miroslav_djordjevic" rel="nofollow">Djordjevic</a>
may also be an option, there are pictures of a revision on their website. They also work in NY from time to time.
</p>
<p>
And
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/y0krwx/revision_expert/irsk9t5/" rel="nofollow">here</a>
was also a discussion.

Wow i saw your post and briefly wondered if I posted it and forgot. I am having the exact same issue, almost a year out with pang. Dilating religiously. UGH. I haven’t tried to get in touch with him again (lately), but he left Mount Sinai and went to align in SF. Going to try and track him down when I finish w some life change things my

I see this is old but wanted to post here to see if you had any updates. I was experiencing this, also was with Pang, however recently started penetrative sex with a partner and that actually fixed me up a lot. Maybe it&#39;s because they can push passed the point in which I started to tense up and eventually relax me, but I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s much easier to Dilate all around since starting to have penetrative sex. For reference I&#39;m 6 months post op

Sadly no. If anything it&#39;s gotten slightly worse.
