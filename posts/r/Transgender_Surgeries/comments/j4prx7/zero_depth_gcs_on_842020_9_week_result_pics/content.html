I see!, thank you for telling me!
</p>
<p>
​
</p>
<p>
I saw in your posts that you added a canal after vaginoplasty with no cavity. Can I ask you, did you still had a dimple when they created your vagina without cavity?
</p>
<p>
See, I really feel dysphoric about my genitals but I am not interested in having to dilate for the rest of my life. I would love to have penetrative vaginal sex with a cavity but for the long term is just not really worth it for me. So I wanted to have zero depth, but I am very affraid that it won&#39;t look natural. I would like to have labia minora, labia majora, clitoris, clitoral hood, and a shallow canal or dimple that doesn&#39;t need dilation to look as natural as possible. But I don&#39;t know which surgeon can provide me with what I want. Also I live in Spain so is a whole different experience with surgeons here. I don&#39;t know what to do to be honest hahaha I cannot live more time with what I have down there, is just too much to bear :(
</p>
<p>
When you did zero depth did they made the dimple, both labia minora and majora and the clitoris and clitoral hood?

Oh but it looked so natural without the dimple and labia minora!
</p>
<p>
It may not be difficult for you but I know a lot of trans woman that regretted full depth because of complications. One of them didn’t have a problem with dilation but you know there is a risk of permanently damaging the nerves of the pelvic floor when they open the cavity between the rectum and the bladder, and that happened to her, and now she has very annoying symptoms for the rest of her life. Another one had a fistula and the other one minor complications but dilations are very painful for her and also penetration (plus she doesn’t feel any pleasure in the cavity). And it’s so scary for me :(
</p>
<p>
And is not that I have a doubt, I truly don’t want to risk myself to the complications and dilation for the rest of my life :( I just want to have a natural look hahah. But idk, maybe I will feel incomplete once I do it? Don’t know. Maybe I’ll do full vaginoplasty and if dilations goes wrong I will stop doing them xd
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much for the information!

I&#39;m considering no-depth vulvoplasty for myself in the very-far-from-now. I like the low risk of complications, the short recovery time, I&#39;m not interested in penetrative sex, and I don&#39;t think I would dilate often enough because I wouldn&#39;t make time for it. How did you know that this was the right decision for you?

Thank you so much for the info! I don&#39;t think that many people know that no-depth is an option so I&#39;m pleasantly surprised to hear that your surgeon recommended it.

Thanks!  I had the same problem and because of that I wanted to help others find what they need.  I&#39;m very happy with my results and I&#39;m so glad I went with McClung!  He&#39;s an incredible surgeon.
</p>
<p>
I was only told he required BMI of 28 or better - he never directly stated that to me.  However, I had lost about 70 lbs waiting for surgery anyhow so that might be why he never said.

Thank you so much! Fingers crossed I&#39;ll be getting mine done by end-of-year and it&#39;s very hard to find zero depth examples. This helps a lot. Thank you again and congratulations!

Does your Doctor have a guideline of how he uses the material?  I&#39;m not seeing a Labia Minora?  Is it just the healing/swelling making it obfuscated?

I dont think I have that....  maybe still just hidden with the swelling? - or they either didn&#39;t &#39;make it&#39; or it might be part of the zero depth procedure to exclude them? If he has a guideline I do not know what it is.

I have like .5 inches of play or so ( ot much of anything really...)but it is considered zero depth.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m quite content at this point too.  My dysphoria has been a much easier thing to handle and all, which was my main concerns prior.

Did you have to have the same extensive hair removal (Electrolysis) prior to the surgery as is required with standard GCS?

I started out doing electrolysis as normally required for GCS, but by the 3rd session we had determined that zero depth was whatvI was going to do. At that point, my surgeon said I did not have to continue with that.
</p>
<p>
As of now, I&#39;ve found no hairs within the labia - however prior to my laser hair treatment last week, the labia and pubic area had definetly overgrown since surgery, making me think if anything was to start growing inside the labia, it would have by now.
