Cardenas? Oh boy, his forehead work is not the best. You seem to have a flat spot above the browbone which gives it a masculine slope. Did he simply shave? Or reconstructed your forehead??

Are you kidding me? She looks very feminine and the side profile is definitely passing. Not all cis women have completely ‚Äúflat‚Äù foreheads. She has beautiful feminine curves from the side.

Thanks for your kind words. I&#39;m not a massive fan of my upper area still, but then, which of us are?
</p>
<p>
I do feel like there&#39;s a small &#34;indent&#34; area just above my eyebrows. Nothing too major, but the way shadows move on my upper face in harsh light can seem a little strange, like something is missing there.

It&#39;s all about lights and shadows. Did you have any CT scans to prepare you for surgery? I would&#39;ve have asked him what type of forehead reconstruction he&#39;s doing. It&#39;s good to ask questions, it&#39;s your one and only face after all! The fact that he does all this &#34;preparation&#34;  in a matter of 24 hrs is Very concerning. Almost like fast food surgery....

I believe a Type 3 would&#39;ve been an optimal approach to her forehead, but at the end of the day its what makes her feel happy and seen as how she wants to be seen. After all, we always strive to look our best since our faces are the first thing people look at.

Totally agree!  I had type 3 and mine is very similar.  I also just had a revision consult and they said my forehead looks great.  Hers is definitely fem.

Where are you coming from lovely?
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m from the UK and chose Cardenas because of his price and experience. I found his team helpful, but I don&#39;t speak Spanish so there was some difficulty in communicating. I did find that some instructions for post-op care were a bit confused because of this (for example where exactly to put the pressure bandage), with the nurses and the team of doctors telling me different things
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m very much a shy Brit who &#34;doesn&#39;t like asking too many questions&#34; so it was tricky to constantly ask questions. It really helped that my best friend (quite an outspoken woman, and I love her for it) was with me, so that she could really fight my corner.
</p>
<p>
After 10 days I could do everything other than run a marathon, but I still looked like hell. Everyone&#39;s recovery is different but I hope you have some way of taking it easy after surgery, you will need it.

i‚Äôll be coming from usa and its a pretty short flight from my location, thankfully. but i dont have anyone coming with me. im deffinately not shy to ask wuestions tho, if anything i talk too much üòÖüòÖ  i dont speak spanish either, i know a very little though but i doubt any that would be helpful haha so thanks for the heads up. does the wifi work efficiently at the hospital‚Äîlike i could use google translate to get my point across better if needed?
</p>
<p>
i pretty much just have my 10-night stay there for ‚Äútaking it easy‚Äù, which is why i ask üòÖ back home i‚Äôll be going about my daily life which involves a lot of stress, bending, heavy lifting, high pressure situations etc‚Ä¶ my only releif will be pain meds or cbd tea, something to try and take the edge off but i feel pain isnt too big a concern that far post op anyways, i just worry about causing damage or strain on the wounds or healing process etc üòï

How long after the surgery did you fly back and how did you find the flight? I&#39;m also coming from the UK to see him and I&#39;m a little scared of such a long flight back while feeling really rough.

Do you still have the pain? If yes, where? I&#39;m 3.5 weeks post FFS, and I&#39;m so tired of non stop pain.

There&#39;s always Dr. Baez in Guadalajara and Dr. Rossi in Argentina. These guys actually pre-scan your face with CT scans to ensure the best possible and predictable outcome. Don&#39;t settle for less tbh. Being cut open just to have mediocre results is absolutely heartbreaking. All for the similar price too..

I had a neanderthal brow (we&#39;re talking 99th percentile, it was bad, real bad) and I went to Dr Rossi and he performed magic on my browridge, same price as cardenas but like twice as aggressive, yet it looks completely natural.
