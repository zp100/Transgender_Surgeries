Hi, I am deleting everything about Kamol, I have nothing but problems, stalkers, threatening and online abuse after posting comprehensive review on blogspot and comments here.
</p>
<p>
This is the final summary as per end of 2022 (over 8 months after all the operations):
</p>
<p>
Conclusion, Kamol did charge me something like USD$57000 in total, they did following:
</p>
<p>
SRS - it needs revision of inner labias , they did not join it with anything at the bottom so pee goes all over the body, another op to fix hair growing inside the vaginal canal, erectile tissue to be removed... SRS was to be PPV and ended up some mix of PIV with some PPV &#34;ala Kamol&#34; with external skin being used inside, depth was lost because of no proper training how to do dilation, supplied dilators are wrong shape and really do not fit the purpose, it is about 9 months now and I am still bleeding, have pain... and go on with this one...
</p>
<p>
Fat transfer is just a one big bad job and it needs revision, lucky me they did not kill me there when they were injecting fat into my buttocks
</p>
<p>
Breasts are horrific with double bubble deformation and I it needs total replacement or mesh reinforcement to keep existing implants in secure.
</p>
<p>
HIFU face lift was just a waste of money, the guy was on his phone once doing it so I ended up with one side of my face having different profile than the other side, it is just starting going back to normal now
</p>
<p>
Electrolysis was done so carelessly that I am left with permanent holes in my skin, some size of 1mm deep
</p>
<p>
Adam&#39;s apple was done OK but not as much as I would imagine, small reduction only
</p>
<p>
FFS was not done because Dr.Kamol had some &#34;mental moment&#34; during the consultation, so never happened - and thank you God for than, it was God&#39;s intervention and I am grateful I did not get this done there.
</p>
<p>
Hair transplants - the total success but only because done by DHT clinic - not Kamol Hospital...
</p>
<p>
So I need 3 more operations, fix of SRS, fix of fat transfer, fix of BA.
</p>
<p>
I would suggest to consider other institutions once you are deciding where to get your procedures to be done. Think twice, you have one body and one life.

We need to be more honest about surgeons. So many people with a botched job say, &#34; it wasn&#39;t the surgeons fault..&#34;  when it plainly was. This is such a fast growing area of medicine that vulnerable people need to be helped by honest reviews, not in sincere ones. It&#39;s a shame you have been hounded like that.

Sorry to hear of your troubles.  It’s weird with Kamol because it seems he either gets glowing reviews or complaints of botched surgery.  I wonder what is going on there?
