Thank you for sharing.  I’m about 5 weeks from my surgery date, so I’m eager for people’s experiences.

Happy to share. I looked at a lot of these and paid very close attention to the ones about Bluebond leading up to my surgery, so I’m happy to give the information/insight to others.

What kind of stuff did they send with you when you were discharged from the hospital?  And how long did those supplies last?  I’m trying to figure out what I need to prepare ahead of time.

They sent me home with like 3-4 bags full of stuff. Some of it ran out in a few days, other things lasted a couple weeks. You will definitely need to order things for yourself to take over when you run out of things.
</p>
<p>
The stuff they gave me included chux pads, maxi pads, wet wipes, a couple tubes of lube, some gauze/things to apply to certain areas in the healing process, some foam things to prop your legs up during dilation (I don’t ever use them. They are huge and a hassle to get out and put away all the time), a cushion to sit on to alleviate pressure, and obviously the dilators. (This is all that I’m remembering now. I may have forgot something).
</p>
<p>
The things I ran out of the fastest were lube, chux, and pads. You will go through lube very quickly so you will want to stock up on that (surgilube - you can get it on amazon). You’ll also want to try out some different pad options, as you’ll find the size/style you find most comfortable, but I wouldn’t recommend going to crazy with them unless you know you really like a kind and want to wear them longer than you need to. I’ve personally switched to panty liners because that’s all I need at this point during the day. I only wear pads when I sleep at this point if even that. With the chux, order the ones sold as dog pee pads. They are cheaper and basically the same thing (sizes may vary, but you really don’t need large ones at all by the time you get to using your personal supply). You will run out of wet wipes and gloves too, but when that happens depends on how many you personally take/ask for and collect while you’re there. You’ll need to stock up on those eventually, so it would be easy to just stock up before (you’ll use them eventually cleaning up from dilations).

That helps so much, thank you!  The office has said a few times “don’t worry about supplies, we’ll send them home with you”, but haven’t ever been willing to go into specifics.  I’m not local, and I want to have everything arranged as much as possible ahead of time.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like by week 5 you’re doing really well.  I’ve got a bunch more questions about how the recovery is going:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
How active are you throughout the day?
</li>
<li>
Back to work/normal daily life?
</li>
<li>
How quickly were you able to take, say, a half-mile to a mile walk?
</li>
<li>
How much driving do you think you could manage at this point?
</li>
<li>
Can you focus on work-type tasks (say, sitting with a laptop and handling online meetings and emails)?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sorry for all the questions, but I’m coming from Minnesota, and figuring out the logistics of all of this has been difficult, especially with Covid.  I’ll be staying with family in northern NY once I can leave the city, but I’m still trying to figure out how long I need to stay there before I can be more active, travel back home without flying (but then go back east for the 12-week follow-up), get back to my job, etc.  I hear from some people that I need to give it 8-10 weeks, from others it seems like it may be shorter than that.

At this point I’ve done walks to and from errands/drinks with friends outside. I’ve done 20-30 min walks at a time, but I definitely haven’t been doing those everyday.
</p>
<p>
Everything for me is remote right now, so I’ve been doing all my stuff from home and slipping my dilations in between things. I’m definitely back to “normal” covid life, but I don’t know what my situation would be otherwise if I had to be at work or something regularly.
</p>
<p>
I had to work myself up to walking longer distances. I’d say it was a couple weeks after being home that I wasn’t worried about getting exhausted on longer walks.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea about driving. I live in ny so there’s no need for me to drive. I drove when I lived elsewhere and I would assume by my time sitting now that I’d be fine driving, but I don’t know for sure by any means.
</p>
<p>
And I’m perfectly fine doing work type tasks/online meetings/emails/etc. that’s pretty much all I do. I did a little of that on my last few days at the hospital, but I’ve been doing it basically every weekday since my first full week home. (You will find it’s much more comfortable to prop yourself up in a bed rather than sitting in a chair for the work though)
</p>
<p>
And i would say it depends a lot on your schedule more than the physical limitations past the 3-4 week mark because of dilating 4 times a day. If you are able to do all your work/etc. from home right now, it’s really not bad at all. If you have to be in-person some place, I could understand waiting til 6 week mark when dilation drops to 3 times a day and becomes a bit more manageable to fit in a lunch break from work

My work is part-time, flexible schedule, and entirely remote right now anyway.  So maybe I’ll be able to return to some of my duties a lot earlier than scheduled.  I’ve been uncertain if I’d be tired and not want to push things too fast, or if I’ll be bored out of my mind and glad to have something useful to do.
</p>
<p>
I really appreciate your responses.  It’s helping me prepare.  Thank you.

Pain level?  How long did you have pain down there? What and how does scarring look? Are you pleased with your results?

Pain level varied from day to day but it was pretty bad the first 3 or so days. That being said, it wasn’t pain down there. It was all pain in my stomach/abdomen from the gas that’s used by the machine her team uses for the surgery.
</p>
<p>
I never really had any pain down there. It was all in my abdomen/stomach.
</p>
<p>
The scars are coming along. I don’t have any stitches visible in the external scars anymore. There may still be some in the internal lips, but nothing that I notice anymore personally. There’s still a bit of scabbing in some spots, but in most areas it’s to the point pat that where they are mainly just red.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I’m very pleased with my results so far. I’m still very swollen in the front, but I’m okay to wear leggings now and manage pretty well with daily life. I get to start exercising next week, which I’m very excited about. That being said, there have been many downs to go with the ups. I’ve had issues post surgery with spiking fevers. This is likely a personal issue though. I was looked at by the team twice to ensure it wasn’t serious, so I know I’m okay, but it wasn’t fun going through all the testing after I’d been sent home and dealing with the fevers in addition to the normal recovery stuff. It was definitely all worth it regardless.

My post-op guidelines/surgeon say I can resume normal exercising/heavier lifting at 6 weeks. Right now I’ve only been allowed to do my walks and very light yoga/stretching. So next week I get to work myself back into my normal routine of doing yoga and higher impact workouts (I’ve been told to ease into it, which I have to do anyway because of all the muscle and weight loss I’ve had over the last couple months from surgery and being sick the month before surgery)

I live in nyc, so don’t quote me on this, but I believe they make you stay within a hour of the office for like 3-4 weeks postop (1st week is in hospital)

So, if I may ask (and I cannot recall seeing it posted anywhere in the veritable tons of Dr. RBb-L postings I’ve read) for your required weekly post-surgery exams, was a speculum used? How was that experience? (P.S. I’m 84-days and a wake-up to my Dr. RBb-L GRS)!

Yes, it’s used so she can look at internal stitches/healing and to clean/clip things. The first 1-2 times it was used, it was strange/uncomfortable, but that mainly had to do with the cleaning/clipping while it was in and not the speculum itself. After those first 2 times, it really wasn’t a big deal at all.

My surgery with them is in 5 weeks, and I’m from the Midwest.  You have to stay within an hour of the hospital for two weeks after you are discharged (so, 20 days total, including time in the hospital).  After that you are free to go home, and the week 3 and 4 follow up appointments can be done over video.

I called in May of 2019.  My original consult date was late August 2020.  Some diligent calling about cancellations got it moved to June 2020.  Then this Spring, when everything was shutting down, they moved to telehealth consults and I got it moved up to late April.  They gave me a surgery date after that, though I still had to make a trip to NYC in July for brief physical exam.
</p>
<p>
Edit: Originally put “May 2018”, but it was really 2019.  Sorry about that.

Yeah, I wasn’t sure for a while after they scheduled all of them, and was really relieved when they said it was just 1 &amp; 2.  Nathan even said the 12wk could be video if necessary, though they strongly prefer in-person.  They understand that travel is hard, especially with Covid.
</p>

Feel free to contact me if you ever have questions or want to talk about something.  I don’t know if I’ll be doing any kind of big posts about it, but I’m happy to help.

Congratulations!  I’m curious how you feel about it?  Are you excited for what’s to come once the healing process is over?
</p>
<p>
One thing I find myself fixating on is my transition timeline.  Where does this leave you in yours?  What’s next, if anything?

I feel good about it and I’m at a point where my life is normal enough that I don’t feel like the recovery has taken over my life anymore (it definitely felt like that for a bit).
</p>
<p>
I’m very excited for what’s to come, especially looking at where I am now. I’m excited to start exercising again and I’m enjoying not having to tuck with my clothes and to be able to wear leggings without thinking anymore. I’m also excited to eventually be intimate with someone again without the dysphoria down there. Everything down there has been very sensitive since like week 1, so I’m not worried at all about enjoying that/feeling things.
</p>
<p>
In terms of timeline, this is very close to the end for me. This was my 4th surgery. Only things left I will eventually do is get a trach shave and do some more laser on my face (My hair removal got interrupted because of covid and I started having some regrowth of dark hair that I very much want to get rid of and will be doing so very soon). Other than those two things, I’m done with anything transition-specific. I pass well and happy with almost all of my appearance now, so I’m in a good mental place.
