Zukowski FFS nightmare
</p>
<p>
I had FFS and BA with Dr. Zukowski 4 months ago and It’s been nothing but a nightmare. I’ve been avoiding saying anything negative, but I think at this juncture I will not be going back to him or trust him to ever touch me again. Nor has he even acknowledged most of his mistakes instead blaming my own personal anatomical structure. He however did acknowledge my breast aug and said he could try to fix at least some of it. Although, will make me wait the full year before. One implant is riding high but hopefully still has a chance to drop so my breast don’t look completely botched. Both implants roll around my chest like they are pinballs. Either rolling off to the sides of rib cage, pressing into my arm pit or kissing in the center which causes great pain while I sleep. He did state that correcting the symmastia he left me with would be difficult for him and he was unlikely able to do it. Dr Zukowski said I should be happy to have breast and something about a lot of girls want their cleavage to be close together. although I spend most nights with chest pain from my implants pulling my muscle from my rib cage or sliding into my arm pit. I struggle to sleep every night  and want nothing more to have them out of me. Prior to surgery I stated several times that I wanted to go smaller in my implants both on various phone conversations with him and I’m person. I let him sell me on the “conservative” size of 425cc but most likely the large implant size is what caused these issues.
</p>
<p>
On to my face... type one and a chin implants didn’t cut it for me. my chin is longer then it was pre-ffs and because of the rhinoplasty both are more noticeable(nose look smaller forehead appears to stick out more. I thought I could get away with type 1 but it clearly has its place and wasn’t for my brow bone structure. His contouring is tight but left jagged noticeable lumps through out my skull. I did go into surgery with the expectation I might have to get type 3. I didn’t expect to have to get a sliding genioplasty as well but it is what is. This is nothing on Dr Z but girls even if you think you don’t need it you probably should look for a doctor that at least offers both. To comment fully on the rest of his work, my chin is implant is off center, my nasal tip has to be revisioned by another surgeons and my hairline and eyebrow lift will need to have the same(mainly cause he won’t fix them). My nasal tip has a noticeable beak deformity more so then prior to procedure; Dr. Z was my second rhino he reassured me he could correct the mistakes of the first rhino. I can’t blame him for the deformity but IMO he is not adequately skilled enough to have promised to be able to fix it if he wasn’t actually able to fix it. After I raised the concern to him he told me no doctor can fix my nose. Seeing another surgeon I was told the it can be fixed with cartilage grafting and stints to support the tip during healing and that it should’ve been done that way in my 2nd rhino revision. My biggest issue with Dr. Z,’s work is that my brow lift and hairline are noticeably asymmetrical on the right side of my face. It changes my face enough that I look like two different people put together. The right brow is floating noticeably high making it look as if I’m intrigued 24/7. my hairline also noticeable sliding higher going up the right side. It looks like my hairline is sliding back and pulling the brow with it. I have a giant crooked scar angling across my forehead hopefully that will go away but it’s deff not appealing. He contoured one of my inner orbital bones around my eye which made my eye bigger but only did it on R side, the L side was not contoured on the inner orbital and I woke up from surgery with a large chunk of bone broken out on the L side of my eye. My face looks okay, just very long but that’s not his fault as much as just his techniques were not adequate for me. The Chin implant masculinized my face. Though my jaw is very lumpy and from ct scans looks like issue is with the bone contouring, it is not scar tissue like he said. I think I’m more frustrated with his bed side manner then anything atm. I really think he has done better work so I don’t know what happened, but the consensus amongst the people I’ve spoken with is that he’s just gotten sloppy the last couple years but the hons still love him so idk.
</p>
<p>
Dr Z has only offered to tighten the pockets on my breast so they don’t slide of my my rib cage or up my rib cage anymore, take the bone lump he left protruding on the side of my nose and fill in my cheeks with secondary fat grafting so I don’t look like a meth addict. He pretty much out right refused to do any other revisions and made it clear that If have any work done to correct my forehead and chin before his revisions he would never touch me again or even do those 3 revisions. Though I don’t think I can struggle through a year like this and I really don’t think I want him touch my body a second time. For such little amount of work he is even willing to do to correct the issues.
</p>
<p>
I went to him because there wasn’t a lot of resources for other ffs surgeons that work with insurance only to find out now that there are some amazing surgeons all over the country that in fact do and don’t advertise it. I did all the work to have the surgeries approved for Keojampa but I didn’t have the 5k to book an apt., went to Lee but every second it was an excuse on not filing paperwork for insurance and his office is the worst to deal with. So I turned to Dr Z. I regret my impatience.my advice to the girls that are getting ffs through insurance just call around first I should’ve put more research into it and I regret that I did not. Instead I got “free surgery” as doctor Zukowski stated even though my insurance wrote him a $100,000 dollar check.

Sorry to hear of your struggles :(
</p>
<p>
I had a consult with him myself. Your story basically affirms my gut feeling. Hope you find a suitable surgeon for revision!

Check Peter Raphael in Texas or Jumaily in LA. I met a lot more trans women After ffs and moving to LA those are two of the go to doctors in the trans community for fish work. I know Jumaily takes insurance because my friend had ffs and rhino revision work done with him a couple months ago and she came out beyond amazing. Her revision rhino is like next level from Jumaily. I’ve now seen a lot of Peter Raphaels work and that man is an artist.

What kind of surgeon is he that he can&#39;t even do a proper boob job? Most experienced and board certified plastic surgeons almost all of them can do a decent boob job. This shows It is never really worth to go to surgeons who have prior history of botched surgeries. Even one is one too many. I&#39;m sorry for you but by your description, most of his mess sounds fixable. The chin implant can be removed and the boob job redone. Do you have nerve damage? I hope your boobs remain sensate.

Lost sensation in my L nipple I’m still hoping it comes back. I have a slight chest wall deformity inverted sternum that I’m sure made the breast aug more difficult but most the issues seem less related to that and seem more commonplace when large of implants are used on someone with small breast. I was supposed to have a BA with another doctor in February but covid cancelled it so I went to Dr. Z. The problem is that most likely it will need to be revised with additional support material and perm stitches that he doesn’t seem prepared or able to do provide that type of surgery. My first doctor said that going to big in implants with my chest would cause issues like rolling off the chest wall. He also said that symmastia was an extremely low risk he said if anything it would be even less likely and doctor Z reassured me of the same thing. Then when it happened he said it was because of my deformity and that he was extremely conservative in breast implants I was 30a and now I’m a 32DD a size I never wanted

Yeah bad surgeons tend do the most damage. I hope the nipple sensation returns. I have numbness to my chin cause my nerve canal on my right jaw was cut together with the nerve. So I&#39;m 100% numb on right side of lip and chin not due to a random mistake but because of complete incompetence and negligence of a shit surgeon in Belgium.

Never once did I say I wanted giant breast and I repeatedly said I wanted smaller. I don’t understand why he needed the oversell when I wasn’t asking for it.

I went to Zukowski in 2012. What you describe is his same old fashioned technique. The forehead scar still remains for me. The brows are uneven. But some tell me that is normal to have some uneveness with brows.
</p>
<p>
I had a revision nose job after Zukowski with different doc. A rhinoplasty specialist.
</p>
<p>
He does a hair line advancement that creats a strange shape at the top of your head. The Type 1 forehead he does reduce the frontal bossing, but does not create the true female shape of the forehead that a Type 3 can.
</p>
<p>
With all that aside. Dr Z did make a significant improvement towards looking more female. He was still better than many other options. But 100k to insurance is BS.  I paid 10k for forehead and nose in 2012.
</p>
<p>
But don&#39;t go to him for revision, there are more Type 3 options available.

I’d say he made improvements but I also passed before. So it’s hard. Half my face looks really good which is why I’m not complaining much it is the other half as my friend put it my right side looks “like I’m having a stroke” my BA is the nightmare but both together has caused a great deal of depression and frustration for me. He destroyed my breasts and I only hope I can find a doctor capable of being able to fix them that isn’t 15-20k.

Its minor stuff in my face buts since it’s all stacked on one side of my face it adds up. Well aside from my nose but again I shouldn’t have chosen him for such a delicate revision.

Sounds familiar, if you had adams apple reduction, how&#39;s the crooked scar across your throat?

It pulls a lot. It’s not to glaring but it pull. I was super concerned about the neck scar to be. I didn’t get why everything he does is crooked though. Seems like he seriously is like a carpenter that eyeballs his work with out any measurements.

Try not to tip your head back too much which pulls deeply at the healing incision. MONTHS later, I still feel burning deep in that area, if I have spent alot of my work day looking upward.

There are actually quite a few. I didn’t know until after my surge that there were so many that offered it, they just dont advertise. Dr Regina Rodman, Dr Jeff Jumaily, Dr Harrison Lee, and Dr Alexander Sinclair to name a few of them

Sorry I ask because their is specific way to go about this to get coverage of BCBS covers ffs or state requires them to you can request for out-of-network doctors to be covered at In-network if they do not have any in-network since it’s a specialty surgery.
