<p>
My Surgery wit Dr Bryan Rolfes has been the most doomed and ruinous decision that I have ever taken for which I regret with deep shame.
</p>
<p>
I approached Dr Rolfes for my surgery- forehead brow-bossing and jaw surgery. They’ve been categorically mentioned in several emails prior to the surgery. And, honestly, these back-and-forth over emails, online consultation and my travel happened during the COVID times- and it took me to move rocks to visit the US from Indi –securing a VISA, exorbitant airfares and profound travel restrictions.
</p>
<p>
My first visit to the clinic at Rolfes’ clinic at Wayzata, MN whilst it appeared to me no less than a corporate office; precisely a BPO (business processing Office) – the floor meant to Rolfes’ room wherein there were women over hands’-free microphone sitting in row as it seems from the next door –catching ‘prey’/customers/patients. To be honest, and I am not at all exaggerating, I felt no less than Fordist mass production –‘producing’ no less of post-surgery patients happy/unhappy with results. And most strikingly, no one even gets a night to stay in the clinic, the day of the surgery. She/he has to pay an exorbitant amount if seeking nursing on the day of the surgery; not even a minute of ‘care’ for the first 24 hours post-surgery. Seems so, asking to piss-off as the surgery is over –meaning to convey: ‘service is provided ….. it is an (corporate) office with well-established coffee machine, reception desk, multiple floors, well-dressed women walking around. But, if you ask for a coffee in the frozen/white/ snowing winter morning traveling so far from a tropical country, not used to the weather, you’re denied of.
</p>
<p>
So, Welcome to America !
</p>
<p>
The day of my consultation, after waiting a while in the reception area I was called with those simulated hugs/smirks/smiles by the personal assistant of the doctor and asked to entre Rolfes’ chamber. With brief chit-chat with the assistant with reviews been taken –I mentioned with loads of (PLEASE’s !)  requests that “I WANT AN AGGRESSIVE BONE SURGERY). I also did mention, that I am not too pleased with the bone surgeries (facial- FFS) as put in the website of ‘him’, and if I may request for an aggressive one. I was so, so categorical with all my memory-in-place and sane mind, that I recall, how intensely and repeatedly I have asked the personal assistant and the doctor over prior online meetings, over emails and in-person in the consultation about being ‘aggressive over the bone surgery’.
</p>
<p>
Rolfes did arrive after quite some time. A ‘celebrity appearance’  as if consecrating to his presence –which was just 7-10 mins consultation –across the table sat there and chatting over as I felt, it is not a medical consultation but a business meeting. He hardly allowed me to speak; never touched my face to see/diagnose for 1 second either, stopped/interrupted me from what I want to speak, what I desire for in the surgery was certainly NOT his priority, and kept blathering as what he feels is “RIGHT”. And, even in that, I managed to say that I flew so far from India, with lots of trouble, an exorbitant airfare, and I truly do want a result of my desire.
</p>
<p>
On the day of the surgery, I did again said few times, that “ Doctor! I truly want an aggressive bone work”. His mannerism is such so that he’s busy all the time –seems like no time to ‘listen’ patiently about the queries of the patient. He hardly paid any heed to what I said.
</p>
<p>
The surgery went well. YES- a Fordist mass production as we patients were, and hardly that I have seen or heard; have had several surgeries, that the FIRST NIGHT of the surgery, that patient is asked to walk out the clinic, alternatively pay a huge amount (at least for someone from a Third World), and have a night service nurse who practically has nothing to do, when the patient is lying unconscious majorly. Therefore, it is all about MONEY everywhere in his clinic.
</p>
<p>
To my utter surprise gravest humiliation, Bryan Rolfes lied to me grossly -- during the stich removal day that he has done a very successful bone work – eyebrow bossing and jaw angle surgery. And, I as STUPID person as ever, been waiting all these months (since, early March 2022), that my face would settle, the bruising would completely go away, and I heal in a years’ time as promised by the doctor, and I would have a beautifully-shaped jaw and no bony brow-area.
</p>
<p>
None happened! They are all as how it is. I have been SO, SO SILLY, sitting like the STUPID-est person ever that my face would turn beautiful, but I honestly look so ugly. To start with: 1. Bryan Rolfes has done something to my skin that I look 10 years older.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
He hasn’t touched even .1% to the reason I have gone to him- Brow-bone shaving + jaw-angle contouring, despite of, I have been time-and-again stressing on the fact ‘aggressive bone work’ for me.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
He has made a lump-shaped structure on the middle of my forehead, and it is bulged so badly that it seems like, I have a visible and so very unusual protuberance on the middle of my forehead –which looks out-rightly odd.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Please do not take me wrong by no means, but my Indian face has turned into mongoloid Chinese Face post Bryan Rolfes’ infamous surgical craft.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
And finally, I already have had damaged nervesin the lower jaw from the previous surgery. Bryan Rolfes has aggravated the damage and it is a complete facial palsy now with saliva dripping uncontrolled.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
My surgery-stint from communication over emails, visit to the USA-Minnesota clinic and post-surgery communications as “STRATEGIC RACISM”. I am more stunt to the fact that how could he at all lie on the face so confidently. And, We all do pay hard-earned money, been having traveling so far from India with huge flight fares, the lodging expenses for 2 weeks, and others. Adding to all my surgical experiences with regard to my transition; been having done surgeries before elsewhere in other countries –this has been my WORSEST NIGHTMARE SURGERY with the DOCTOR-BEING-THE-LIAR who will ruin your face and would never do what you wish to be changed on your face.
</p>
<p>
In addition: I am stunt to see the positive testimonials for this person. I’m truly not generalizing all, but it forces me to think, that few testimonials are based on acquisition. Given, I chose this surgeon based on reading his testimonials, but he’s by no means anywhere closer to (to my 200% honesty) , is closer to what I made my mind for the surgery with Bryan Rolfes.
</p>
<p>
Thank You !

Thanks for understanding ! Trust me: it was so difficult doing COVID times to fly all-way-through to the US and get this surgery done. And, been hearing about &#39;botched stories&#39; around with the FFS surgeons; whilst I read Rolfes&#39; reviews I found NO NEGATIVE COMMENT. Should have had then realised, how come there&#39;s no negative comment, and that in itself is -A BIG RED ALERT !

Google reviews are deleting reviews now. Rolfes probably paid to have them removed.

I&#39;m not surprised. This is strange and should have been a red alert -- how come a FFS surgeon has no negative testimonials, not a single one.

As I said, you may pissoff ! And, if you so much want to verify my &#34;crazy story&#34; _ visit Minnesota, USA, meet Bryan rolfes and ask which Indian patient have had her surgery got done in March 2022. And now, for God&#39;s sake- pissoff, for good!

Rolfes is well known for being conservative with his bone work. If you wanted aggressive bone work, you should have confirmed as much.l beforehand
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
While it certainly makes it harder for you, most (US) FFS surgeons primarily have experience with white people. Preserving facial identity for other ethnicities will be harder for them. This really sucks and greatly limits options for a lot of people.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure why you expected him to fix the nerve damage from the previous surgery. Even if he was aware of it, there&#39;s not a lot he can do, and there&#39;s always a chance it could get worse. Even though it has been 8 months, there&#39;s still room for that stuff to get better, and I hope it does!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Email correspondence with his office is horrendous for sure. I&#39;ve been dealing with it for over a year myself. The practice doesn&#39;t belong to Rolfes, so he can&#39;t just replace the problem people there and so I don&#39;t hold it against him.

Thanks for your message !
</p>
<p>
But in my case, leaving aside, &#39;being conservative&#39; - he cared none at all to touch the surgeries for which I flew to him from so far. My aim was my bone surgery- and he didn&#39;t even touched .1% of doing anything with brow bone shaving &amp; jaw-angle shaving. What he did, is a lump on the middle of forehead and chin (which is already been operated before).
</p>
<p>
I am already in acme anxiety and depression, feeling like how to fox my face, once again ..

Rolfes is generally does pretty conservative work.
</p>
<p>
That said, some valid complaints I&#39;ve heard were:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Post-operative care.
</li>
<li>
Lack of CT scan usage (this matters for you insofar as your lower jaw work. I&#39;m not surprised if your nerves were damaged).
</li>
<li>
His suture work. You&#39;ll often see the skin bulge at the suture site, and this sometimes results in uneven scars.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Remember, choose your surgeon with care.

Yes - very much so -- a science experiments to Bryan ROLFES with my own heard earned money.

Parag Telang is booked under complaint with Indian medical council &amp; law suits in India. Heard do, he botch the indigenous trans population in India vis-a-vis the &#34;Hijra&#34; extorts huge dum of money &amp; leave them with malfunctioning non-aesthetic body and face. Never trust and Indian surgeon for GRS or FFS. India is terribly homophobic transphobic nation.

I saw reviews of him in Google reviews &amp; in reddit: if you type Parag telang, you should get all his review history (dig into negative comments).

Also, the trans community in India is very well aware of parag Telang the infamous transphobic FFS person. He&#39;s said to be not even a doctor - a local quack.

Some links would help so I can add them to the wiki. Otherwise it’s just one person relaying second hand information, which doesn’t count for all that much.
