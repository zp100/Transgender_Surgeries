Ok so first and foremost my mental health has improved massively I&#39;ve worked past most of my post surgery depression and I feel alot better about my results.
</p>
<p>
The scars have healed massively since the bandages first came off, they are smooth to the touch and quiet soft.  I have started using bio oil for scarification healinh under direction from dr hart.
</p>
<p>
The separation has healed massively though its still a slow going process.  It&#39;s not nearly as painful anymore and it&#39;s really comfortable to sit down but if I overexert the area it becomes sore.
</p>
<p>
Urination has become quite easy. For the longest time I used to pee all over the place and ended up on my scars which caused stinging pain. However this is not the case anymore.
</p>
<p>
Dialation is going really well I&#39;ve not lost any depth and I sit roughly about the top dot  there is no pain when dialating only tightness to begin with during a start of a session. I currently do 3x 1hr sessions a day under guidance from dr hart. I have upgraded to the full soulsource dialator set and currently only am working up to the size two blue dialator O don&#39;t want to go any bigger untill the separation heals more which won&#39;t be an issue for me. It feels quite elastic down there.
</p>
<p>
The ureathra and clitoris are all in one pocket and doesn&#39;t seem or feel right to me and is the biggest part I have a problem with and probably the biggest challenge to my mental health at the time I first posted.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m not sure about how things will feel sexualy but ive  had feelings down there and it definitely feels different but they are infrequent so I can&#39;t really tell right now how thing will be in the future.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically it&#39;s fairly ok but not how I expected it to look how ever it&#39;s not ugly though I will be looking to having labia/clitoralplasty in the future to improve aesthetics but also I want to start exercising and loosing weight and I will see how everything looks down there before going ahead
</p>
<p>
Over all I&#39;m learning to love myself and be more comfortable with how things are right now.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t say that the whole experience so far has been wonderful and amazing because for me it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;ve never been in hospital let alone for a massive surgery and I definitely wasn&#39;t prepared for that. But I&#39;ve grown more as an individual and made me stronger as a whole
</p>
<p>
Please if you have any questions please ask. I&#39;ll be more than happy answer x

Thankyou for posting this. I thought it was just me that had a poor experience, vaginoplasty was my first surgery 10 days ago and really didn&#39;t expect it to be so traumatic.
</p>
<p>
You give me hope xx

Hi! I have an upcoming booking with Dr Hart so I have two questions!
</p>
<p>
How was your experience with Dr Hart and the attending staff? Did you feel that you were listened to and taken care of?
</p>
<p>
Anything you wished you knew in advance for your hospital visit -- any items you wish you&#39;d brought?

The nurses were fantastic and took care of me pretty well there were times where it felt like I was ignored or forgotten over the weekend and didn&#39;t have regular nurses in this times but during the week I had nurses that are absolutely fantastic. Big shout out to Cathie and James and john and a few others I can&#39;t remember the names of  they were awesome. I had student nurses at the time I was in hospital and they were great albeit they were still learning.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#39;t see a lot of.dr hart he always seemed in a rush or busy but he was always upbeat and somehow managed to improve my mood pretty well when he did pop in.
</p>
<p>
I know another girl I was in hospital with she gave him a lot of critical feedback and I am lead to believe from others I&#39;ve spoken to that he&#39;s taken it on board which is great to hear.
</p>
<p>
Must bring items  - a good bar of soap for your first shower and to wash your face and stuff ( I didn&#39;t bring one)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
shampoo and conditioner (you&#39;ll want this for your first shower in a week trust me I didn&#39;t bring them)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
-some wingless pads, regular or maxi. I bought maxis when I was discharged but should brought them prior so i didn&#39;t have to go to shops after discharge.. it was really exshausting.
</p>
<p>
-baby wipes quintessential for going number 2 as they are super soft for wiping.
</p>
<p>
-entertainment like a tablet for Netflix or youtube music and a  Nintendo switch the latter really helped keep me entertained and music is good for mood.
</p>
<p>
-extra long charging cable and power brick for devices (it&#39;s really hard to reach for things post op)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
allens red frogs (great if you are feeling flat) at times
</li>
</ul>
<p>
-a teddy to cuddle helps
</p>
<p>
Definitely ensure you drink plenty of water and depending on what pain relief you might have you could have constipation so make sure you take the stool softeners it will save you a lot of greif later on down the track.
</p>
<p>
When I was in hospital it was lockdown conditions so human contact was nil and could have no visitors so finding ways to keep your self positive is essential

Also babes I really didn&#39;t look after my physical health prior to surgery mainly weight and that almost impacted my results but fortunately I got a successful hybrid PPV result where as higher BMI patients generally don&#39;t and can result in lacking depth and and a smaller vaginal canal in terms of diameter.
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t stress enough how important it is to eat healthy and loose weight and exercise before hand it will really help your recovery and results
</p>
<p>
For reference I at the time of surgery I weighed 130kgs am 6&#39;4 tall (193cm)

Oh wow. This should&#39;ve been me too. I was gonna have srs with hrt in July, but chickened out/didn&#39;t get dysphoria when I had sex for the 1st time.
</p>
<p>
Now I don&#39;t have the money that id put away.
</p>
<p>
Was this his inversion method? What level of health cover did you use and with who?

It still can be hun. I nearly did the same thing, a couple months before surgery I slept with a woman who made me feel amazing sexually in long time. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
I had ppv with him. It&#39;s becoming increasingly popular method of his patients and getting good results long term.
</p>
<p>
I have silver plus cover the second highest cover with Medibank private, only thing it doesn&#39;t cover is pregnancy lol

I wish, id taken all my super out when it was tax free last year (I only had 13K in it).
</p>
<p>
It was so bizarre, I was all booked in, and then I hooked up with a guy, didnt get dysphoria using it, my therapist said I should put it (surgery) on hold.
</p>
<p>
Then life got in the way (debts, car etc).
</p>
<p>
I still have my health cover, bupa silver, but Itll take at least a decade to save that money (only work part time).

Would you mind naming your therapist.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of people have bottom surgery with dysphoria. Doesn’t mean much.

You prove the point then. You don’t need dysphoria to have surgery, and if your therapist hadn’t said not to, you would have by now.
</p>
<p>
You can get SRS in Thailand for a lot less than that. How come it’s so much?

If my friends and therapist hadn&#39;t said anything, yeah, id be 4 months post op by now. Its one of my biggest regrets. But my dysphoria comes and goes, and I don&#39;t think its severe enough.
