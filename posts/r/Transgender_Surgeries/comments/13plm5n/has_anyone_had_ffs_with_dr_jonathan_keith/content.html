Ive heard mixed reviews about him, and can’t find any record of anyone ever getting FFS with him, but I figure it must be harder to fuck up than SRS so Im on the fence about it. Does anyone know anything?? Or any other FFS surgeons in NJ who accept medicaid?

This is just my opinion but I’d advise staying away from Dr. Keith for FFS. He doesn’t really perform that as much as other surgeons in NYC. His bedside manner is questionable at times, and I had a BA with him but I now need a revision because he gave me larger implants than what I originally wanted.

I had FFS with him, and I&#39;m not happy with my results.  He does not accept medicaid for FFS as far as I know, so you are better off looking elsewhere.
