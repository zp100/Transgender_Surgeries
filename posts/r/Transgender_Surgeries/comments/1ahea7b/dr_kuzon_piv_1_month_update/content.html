You&#39;re a trans-hero in Michigan as far as I&#39;m concerned. I&#39;ve been trying to research all (2) of the surgeons in Michigan, but they both seem to be quite an enigma.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m glad to see you are healing well! Did you undergo the PI with Robotic Peritoneal Pull-through?

I&#39;m really glad you appreciate what I&#39;ve been trying to do. I had a hell of a time researching dr kuzon myself, so if I can make this whole process easier from other folks, I&#39;ve achieved what i was after.
</p>
<p>
One thing to note is that Dr. Kuzon, unless there&#39;s been a change in his policy recently, does not do peritoneal pull. Having said that, i still achieved about 5 inches of depth even though I got on blockers shortly after the onset of puberty, and as long as you&#39;ve got plenty of lube, the main benefit of peritoneal pull doesn&#39;t really matter.
