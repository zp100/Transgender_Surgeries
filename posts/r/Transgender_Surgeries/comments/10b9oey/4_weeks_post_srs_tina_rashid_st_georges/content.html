Tina Rashid&#39;s work always looks very neat - I expect you&#39;re pleased.
</p>
<p>
Did you have vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty?
</p>
<p>
How&#39;s your recovery going?
</p>
<p>
Any problems?
</p>
<p>
Edit: Forgot to say Congratulations!!!!!!! ü§ó

Thank you! I am absolutely thrilled with the results.
</p>
<p>
It was vaginoplasty, PI. I got just over 5&#34; depth which I&#39;m super happy with.
</p>
<p>
Recovery is going great. The first couple of weeks were rough. I had a lot of pain and issues with dilating. Within the last week I feel like I&#39;m getting back to normal. I walked about 5km today and it was no problem whatsoever. I&#39;m moving up to the next size dilator and can manage to hit depth pretty consistently.
</p>
<p>
I had some sutures split about a week in that are healing well. They made it difficult to dilate for a while. I also had a UTI and some bad nerve pain. I went to the GP who sorted it out so all good. Overall, it&#39;s been pretty smooth and I&#39;m really happy with my pace of recovery. The worst thing right now is the boredom of being at home most of the time and not working lol

Quick followup question...
</p>
<p>
I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking, but did Tina Rashid require you to have much hair removal before surgery?
</p>
<p>
Thank you üòò x

Would you mind me asking how was your size pre op? Im trying to figure out if max depth with PI is roughly same length or a bit shorter

Hi, hope you‚Äôre recovery has settled well. I‚Äôm having my consultation with miss rashid in February. Could you tell me what is it you think is different to what she did here? And if it isn‚Äôt too much to ask, would you be willing to share photos? I‚Äôm sorry for asking that, but I‚Äôve just been researching a lot prior to surgery.
</p>
<p>
Really appreciate! üôè

Hi, ive also got a consultation coming up with Tina and would love to hear ue experience/see the difference if that would be ok with you. Was this difference intentional because you asked for it or sge just did it different by herself?

Could you please tell us a little bit about your experience at the hospital?

I had mine with Miss Rashid a few months ago, Parkside Private hospital. The nurses there were knowledgable and nice, but there was no gender specialist on night staff.
</p>
<p>
I have anxiety about blood and bleeding and they never seemed to get annoyed when I called them about it.
</p>
<p>
They were a little bit short with me about painkillers, I got morphine for about 2 hours total (I would have gotten addicted that stuff is amazing) and they refused to get me anything stronger than ibuprofen when I couldn‚Äôt sleep due to pain.
</p>
<p>
The food was okay, I am vegetarian so it got boring real quick. If I could do it again I would have mixed in a meal or two containing meat, or ask them for a meal with meat substitutes. As far as hospital food goes it was nice.
</p>
<p>
My room was nice, I had AC but I never used it, I recommend keeping the window open during the day since the fresh air does wonders for your mental health. Get them to open the blinds during the day too, it makes a HUGE difference.
</p>
<p>
The longest shittiest period was the first 2 days. I was gassy and in so much pain. It was a huge learning curve and I dealt with it by sleeping constantly.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I recommend brushing your hair on day 3 to prevent it from tangling too much, even if you have curly hair.
</p>
<p>
The last shower before op is weird since you‚Äôre looking at yourself naked for the last time. That first shower before you‚Äôre discharged is heavenly.
</p>
<p>
Don‚Äôt forget to actually pick up your discharge paperwork from the nurses like I did LMAO

aw, thanks for sharing. Fingers crossed we all manage to get through it just fine. In the end, as long as we get a vagina that is visually pleasing to some extent, functional and with the littlest complications, that‚Äôs all that matters isn‚Äôt it?!

Even though the road is a bit bumpy!

Thank you! Her results are so consistent, I genuinely feel lucky to have been able to see her on the public system.
</p>
<p>
The hospital was awful. I&#39;ll make a full post about this when I have more time but it was genuinely the worst thing about surgery and recovery. The surgical team are fantastic, but they only come see you a few times. The hospital staff are nice but they are so understaffed it&#39;s ridiculous. One nurse mentioned the patient to nurse ratio was 15:1. There&#39;s too much to type out now but it was awful

Did you still get given soul source dilators or is it the old ones that used to get used?

I‚Äôm honestly not bothered by an NHS hospital if I‚Äôm honest‚Ä¶ had plenty of experiences in them and know exactly what a ward is like üòù

Hello, hope you‚Äôre healing has gone well so far. Any updates on your recovery?

I have surgery with miss Rashid in April. Starting to feel a little nervous. But so excited to finally start a new life cycle.

Would be extremely appreciative if you could give us. An update. üôè

Thank you!

Hi there, I commented on this post earlier in the year but was wondering if you had any info on the St George‚Äôs BMI limit? I‚Äôve just been transferred to St George‚Äôs with consult rather soon.
</p>
<p>
Any help would be appreciated!
