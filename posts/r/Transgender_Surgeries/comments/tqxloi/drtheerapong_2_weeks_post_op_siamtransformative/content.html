HEALING PROCESS So now I am 2 weeks post op and I spent it at my apartment with Cherry from SIAMTRANSFORMATIVE taking care of me dilating twice a day and cleaning+douching. Everything is going great as she took out 99% of the stitches so my swelling is going down very fast. I can walk but I need to be very slow and I can sit with donut pillow but I have to small blisters on my butt where I sit, not painful at all because they are external but I have to be careful. I didn&#39;t have any numbess on my legs and any nerve pain and that is really fortunate as I can understand because it could be bothering for some and this is why I dropped painkillers and I am using just Ibuprofen before dilatating
</p>
<p>
DILATING/CLEANING I have started the big size L dilator and it is still a bit uncomfortable but I manage to do it my self now as the aftercare package is now over so I have to clean and dilate by myself following the instructions they gave me. It&#39;s a bit hard and I need to be very focused especially for the cleaning steps (douching, qtips, cotton and betadine) but I think I am doing good. Also I can text Siamtransformative at any time if I have doubts and they help me as usual.
</p>
<p>
FIRST CONSULTATION Yesterday I also got my first visit post op by doctor Theerapong that looked inside with a dilating scope and cleaned. It was really tickling inside. Clitorid is still super sensitive so I hate when they touch there to check (I still have one stitches there üò±üò±)  but that&#39;s it. Doctor is very satisfied with the result and super happy, he just told me to clean better with douching
