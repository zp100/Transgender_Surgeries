So, a little later than planned, here are my 3 month post-revision (so 9.5 months post 1st Op) pictures. Overall, I&#39;m really happy with the results, and the revision was most definitely worth doing. I&#39;m pleased with how things both look and feel.
</p>
<p>
I was expecting to stay in hospital for 7 nights, but ended up only staying 4...¬† Great news, but had to change all my travel and accommodation plans at the last minute which was stressful in itself!
</p>
<p>
In the Op, they reduced the dog-ears at the top of the labia majora,¬† this seems to be common with this method.¬† They also reshaped the rear of the vaginal opening, which made inserting,¬† well, anything more comfortable,¬† and improved the look as well. I also felt that my clitoris was too large,¬† to the point of being uncomfortable, and asked for it to be reduced a little.¬† This was a game changer, I am far more comfortable,¬† and can reach orgasm much more easily than before, even from just a couple of weeks post Op.
</p>
<p>
The only mild complication I had was a large lump under my right labia majora that was a 2cm long, but although not completely gone it is far, far smaller, maybe a few mm now.
</p>
<p>
Dilation is down to a couple of times a week. My depth has reduced a little,¬† but still about 7&#34;/17cm. Lubrication does happen,¬† it&#39;s not normally enough by itself for dilation, but if I&#39;m aroused enough I can do without!
</p>
<p>
As usual,¬† please feel free to ask me anything!
</p>
<p>
Edit: typo

How are revisions handled insurance wise? Do you know if they are usually covered or are they considered aesthetic?

This isn&#39;t something I&#39;m too familiar with because it was all out-of-pocket for me, but when I got my original quotes from the clinic, both procedures were included, and while the second op is largely cosmetic, some of the changes were functional too.  Either way, they should have all the info before you start the first operation so there shouldn&#39;t be any ambiguity as to what the costs are, and what&#39;s involved. Speaking to another patient at my first appointment who was having a revision, it was covered, but she had to stay a few days longer because of a complication, and the longer stay was not covered so cost her a couple of thousand ‚Ç¨..

Glad to see your 2nd OP went well ! I&#39;m scheduled for my 1st OP with Dr Schaff on the 10th of January, so in less than two weeks. Needless to say I&#39;m very excited and incredibly nervous (already mostly packed my bag so there&#39;s not much left for me to do now except anticipate it).

It&#39;s called the Combined Method, I&#39;ve covered it a few times in previous posts, but very simply, it&#39;s a bit like PI but with scrotal and uses urethral tissue as well, and there are some other differences as to exactly what&#39;s used where.  It&#39;s usually a 2-op process, in Germany at least, which seems to be where the method is used most.  They retain as much as possible in the first stage, then make adjustments in the second. It has similarities to the Suporn method, but there are some differences in how the scrotal tissue is prepared, the clitoris formed etc.

None, they do all that in the first OP by scraping the follicles from the other side of the scrotal skin. It&#39;s a big advantage of this method.

Well I think of it like buying time :) Yes it‚Äôs expensive but the waiting list is like only a couple of months. I think time in the right body is so much more valuable than a couple of thousand euros
</p>
<p>
The only insurance covered comparable surgeon is morath/sch√∂ll and they have a backlog of 1.5-2 years
</p>
<p>
Also your result looks great
