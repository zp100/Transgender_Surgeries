Time for another update.  It&#39;s been a little over 3 months now.  Surgery was July 2nd.  Feeling a lot better these days and I feel mostly back to normal now.  I can sit with the donut for a couple hours without much issue.
</p>
<p>
Updated the collection of pictures:
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/oNJOOPV">https://imgur.com/a/oNJOOPV
</a>
(Definitely NSFW). Looks like I missed a bunch of hair when trimming today... gotta get used to trimming this new anatomy lol.  I&#39;m thinking about maybe having some more of that hair permanently removed.  And I might ask about a revision next time I see my surgeon since my right labia kinda swoops to the left at the bottom.  It&#39;s not interfering with anything, it&#39;s not in the way when dilating or anything, but just aesthetically bothers me.
</p>
<p>
As always, I&#39;m more than happy to answer any questions either here or in private messages.

I didn&#39;t mind the catheter, it was nice not having to get up to go to the bathroom lol
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had some trouble, but you&#39;ll get through this!  I was only in the hospital for 3 days, definitely missed the nurses when I left and had to wake myself up to take meds round the clock.  If you live in NY though they have visiting nurses who will come by once a week to make sure everything is going well and also don&#39;t be afraid to email Bella with questions, she&#39;s usually quick to respond

Wow. Great results. Judging from this and one other post here I have already made the decision to go with her practically. Do you mind if I pm you about the surgery?

She had decently short wait times compared to other surgeons I was looking at at the time I was setting everything up.  I was looking at her and bluebond-lager who had a much longer wait.  Ultimately I went with Avanessian because I knew someone who was also going with her plus the fact that the wait was shorter.  Plus after I met her she completely won me over.  She&#39;s just amazing.  I would have had surgery sooner had she not been on maternity leave last winter

Fwiw my consult was September and my  date is in March.  So the turn around between is not bad, but I don&#39;t know how long the consult list is now.

Well as I mentioned I am not sure how long the wait is for a consult is. My consult was scheduled last  December. I had started in trying to get in back in July 19.  I had tried with BBL and Dr Avanessian at the same time. My consult with BBL (which I need to cancel) is scheduled for February 21.

Yeah, I can&#39;t get if for a few years I guess, im just starting transition. But any wait would be worth it for her, I&#39;m thinking.

The only one that was scary to me was the orange one, but its getting easier.  If you&#39;re having trouble getting to full depth with larger sizes just go full depth with the largest one you can for 10 minutes and then go as far as you can with the next size for a couple minutes, eventually it will go all the way in

Thanks for the photos of your healing progression. As a surgical tech student, I am somewhat disconnected to how postop is, but because I need a GCS, it&#39;s nice seeing postop of what I&#39;m going to be experiencing.

When I started transition there was next to no information on the internet about trans stuff.  Once I got on the right path I wanted to help as many other people as I could.  Especially with surgery, there&#39;s so few good sources of info, I want to help any way I can.  If it wasn&#39;t for the people who came before me I don&#39;t know where I would be today.  If I can help even one person feel less lost then it will have been worth it.

Well then it&#39;s worth it because I&#39;ve been hesitant of the outcome of the penile inversion, but you&#39;ve helped alleviate some of that hesitance.

Hello! I was wondering what lube you recommend to use to dialate? Did your surgeon recommend any?

My surgeon recommended ky but i found the ky gel to be... Not so much of a gel.  It runs a bit too fast for me and can make a mess.  I&#39;ve been using sliquid sassy gel and its been great, stays in place long enough for me to put the lube bottle down and spread it around the dilator before dripping everywhere.  I just wish it was cheaper

I think it&#39;s a better place for it, but ultimately they&#39;re still visible to anyone I&#39;m going to be intimate with so I&#39;m not sure if really matters in the end

I had mine with Ting about 21 months ago, and my suture lines were placed very similarly (which makes sense, he trained her). Those lines have faded a lot more over the months, and are hardly noticeable anymore - you really have to be looking for them and know what to look for. Not that I’ll ever be intimate with anyone who doesn’t already know my history, but it’s unlikely that a partner would notice them, especially in the heat of the moment.
</p>
<p>
Btw, your results look great! I suspect you are/will be very satisfied with them!

I applied Mederma once or twice, and that’s it. Mine faded mostly just with time.

I didn&#39;t apply anything special either, and like with you, they mostly just faded over time. They&#39;re hardly visible now after three years.

I wanted to add that Dr. McGinn also places the incisions close to the inguinal area where the thigh meets the groin  (McGinn did my original vaginoplasty).
