Those who didn&#39;t have too much genitial dysphoria, and weren&#39;t completely certain that a vaginoplasty was the right thing to do...how do you feel a year or more after?

So it&#39;s going to be a bit of a wait for bottom surgery, but I&#39;m trying still to assess how much I
<em>
really
</em>
want it. I don&#39;t have huge genital dysphoria...more that if I was to have sex I&#39;d much prefer to get penetrated vaginally.
</p>
<p>
But I&#39;m also in my late 40s and I&#39;m not sure how much experience I&#39;d actually
<em>
get
</em>
with that.
</p>
<p>
Obviously for those with severe dysphoria, bottom surgery I&#39;m sure brings a lot of relief...but for those who weren&#39;t super-dysphoric about it, how do you feel about it a year or more later, especially with dilation?

Good question. I might be of zero (no) help but maybe I will be? First off the only reasons to ever have full GRS/SRS is to fix severe genital dysphoria, make you happy, healthy, or feel affirmed. It‚Äôs a very serious yet personal decision. If you lack enough dysphoria to justify surgery than Id think long &amp; hard if it‚Äôll be worth it. Statistically most mtf trans girls never undergo bottom surgery. Due to fear of pain, risks, recovery &amp; lifetime upkeep. Also some don‚Äôt have the time or money cause it‚Äôs expensive. Some also don‚Äôt need or want it cause nobody but you or a partner would ever see it. But it‚Äôs not to say it wouldn‚Äôt make you happy. Never do it though because you think you‚Äôll be less of a woman. You‚Äôre valid no matter what‚Äôs between your legs. I‚Äôm non op. But having an orchiectomy in two weeks. That‚Äôs an idea for you maybe? It‚Äôs a cheap, simple outpatient surgery with lots of benefits. Also a stepping stone towards full surgery if you want.

It‚Äôs definitely like a lot of my experience...I‚Äôm much more for feeling better after the changes from transitioning, as opposed to feeling horrible before.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, an orchi is a possibility. Money isn‚Äôt a problem (my province covers it) and I‚Äôm not worried about the surgery itself (especially after getting my BA and FFS). I‚Äôm more worried about the hassle of dilation.

Well I‚Äôd be more confident knowing you‚Äôve  have FFS &amp; breast implants already which are somewhat major &amp; totally noticeable. &amp; if you were happy &amp; both relieved dysphoria afterwards, I‚Äôd say you could handle/benefit bottom surgery. But don‚Äôt rush &amp; look into all options first like an orchiectomy &amp; zero depth grs/srs. Where you don‚Äôt need hair removal or dilation. Maybe research those pros &amp; cons. Glad you have health insurance covering the cost. That‚Äôs a huge savings &amp; comfort for those who need it.  For me (trans girl age 23) my gender transition is just consisting of therapy, hormones, an orchiectomy &amp; eventually maybe two minor FFS procedures cause I‚Äôm lucky I don‚Äôt need much at all. Plus just all cosmetic treatments. Either way I wish you the best &amp; give credit to you in your 40s taking this on. It‚Äôs inspiring. You have lots of good years left to be yourself.

i&#39;m 7 months post op. I feel more confident and a lot more happy with my body post op but also feel like I could have lived without the surgery too if I didn&#39;t have it funded for me.

I had SRS back in 2017 and I had it done because I was over having to tuck so I feel like it was done mainly for cosmetic reasons and I have no regrets.

Regret since they weren‚Äôt even decided they wanted this?
</p>
<p>
Complications, the effort involved with maintaining a vagina and how a dilation schedule basically is a full time job for 3 months.
</p>
<p>
All these things are worth going through the trouble
<strong>
if
</strong>
you really want SRS. When someone who is on the fence about SRS has to go through these things, it can be a huge burden for something they could have lived without.
</p>
<p>
SRS is a long term investment when it comes to healing and if someone is ‚Äúmeh‚Äù or unsure about SRS, they need to take a step back and steer clear.

I was in that same place a little over a year ago.  Then, for reasons, I thought, you know what? Yeah, let&#39;s at least schedule this.
</p>
<p>
So, now I&#39;m 3 days away from surgery, and you know that feeling you get when you&#39;ve signed a lease for a place of your own, but you still have a month of looking at your (previously awesome) roommate&#39;s dishes in the sink, and suddenly you can hardly stand to share the common room with them?
</p>
<p>
It&#39;s like that, but for my junk.

Right, I meant conflicted and still got the surgery.  I think almost everyone is pretty sure they want it by the time the anesthesia starts bc it&#39;s such a commitment.
</p>
<p>
Being nervous or having a few doubts is normal, but I wouldn&#39;t think many are undecided and just flip a coin.

I definitely wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m &#39;truly enjoying&#39; it at all. If I was, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be getting the surgery. Like, if I could magically transform my penis into a vagina instantly I&#39;d do it in a heartbeat.

If you have any shred of love for your birth parts do not get SRS....
</p>
<p>
SRS is a huge surgery that requires years of care and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
I hated my penis and this entire journey has been hard on my mental health, I can‚Äôt imagine someone who was content with there birth parts try and do this.
</p>
<p>
IMO; SRS is not for you if you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mind‚Äù your birth parts.
