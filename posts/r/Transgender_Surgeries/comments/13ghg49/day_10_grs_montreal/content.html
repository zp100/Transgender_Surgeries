She&#39;s really swollen (see second pic); how long did your swelling like this last? I just hope she doesn&#39;t stay like this.
</p>
<p>
ER last night gave me more pain meds (I ran out already), antibiotics just in case, and stool softener (I don&#39;t have problems with my bowels despite 20mg of Dilaudid per day, but I digress)
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m exhausted. Definitely don&#39;t do this if you aren&#39;t ready and have a ton of support. I&#39;ve gotten every short end of the stick unfortunately, and everything sucks. Just gotta stick with it though.

It took 3 months for all the swelling to subside but the worst was gone after a month. Pain does calm down as the stitches start to dissolve.
</p>
<p>
Take each day at a time, and it does get easier. Talk to people, even if it is online, as that&#39;ll help.

My bad! I like him..
</p>
<p>
I wouldn&#39;t have gone to GRS MONTREAL if it wasn&#39;t free. CAMH (Canadian Association Mental health or something like that) social worker told me that ohip (the government insurance that paid for my surgery) was stopping out of country approvals sometimes. I wanted to go to McGinn, but I didn&#39;t want to wait 9 months for funding approval just to be denied and have to start over and wait 9 months again.
</p>
<p>
Brassard himself is very gentle. He&#39;s very charismatic in person, definitely put my mind at ease before my surgery, but I wasn&#39;t nervous at all to be honest. Complete zen and calm before my surgery. I felt like I was in good, experienced hands. That&#39;s important to me with the potential for complications, of which I seem to collect like crazy.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m happy I picked him. Im considering a labiaplasty after I recover, but I want to see what I get from his surgery before I look into that.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you have any questions :)
