Sad to hear this for you. I&#39;ve been to Argentina twice now but never wanted to go near him as I suspected these issues. My first FFS in 2019 was okay served me reasonably for 3 years. But there were some shortfalls, I think in part from squeezing too much into one surgery.
</p>
<p>
My partner and I have recently returned from Córdoba Argentina and are quite happy with our results.  Her: FFS and hair Me: 1/ FFS revision, 2/ BA, body shaping, tummy tuck
</p>
<p>
So yes there is a good surgeon close to you who can help remedy these issues affordably and very well.

That&#39;s a huge move! I love the people and the country. But the dilapidated state of everything from decades of corrupt governments of all ilks… I&#39;m not sure if I could deal with that permanently. I&#39;d probably be killed for my outspoken political commentary!  The driving would send me nuts too. We were so happy to be home in Australia. Simple things like driving down clean orderly streets, cars sticking to lanes, footpaths you can walk on without carefully watching every single step for yawning holes.  And bread! Lovely soft beautiful bread…

Oh don&#39;t get me wrong the driving is a nightmare and I probably won&#39;t be driving in the city. I like the buses very much though. There&#39;s almost no public transit here. I&#39;m a disabled wheelchair using college student and I literally have to call and make an appointment two weeks in advance to get to an appointment with our bus system, it has routes but they don&#39;t go where I need them to always. I used my cane mostly when I was traveling and I should be strong enough to do that more often by the time I move there. The corrupt government and disaster of a financial system is worth it to me however. Like yeah my life is going to turn on an absolute dime no matter how much I prepare. But it reminds me of the city I grew up in. Which of course is completely different now.  But in all the chaos, I found comfort. One of my partners does live here with his wife and so that may be hard to leave behind but they&#39;re considering moving too soon. So we&#39;ll see. I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t expect an essay about this but yeah xD

Girl I&#39;m so sorry you had that mistreatment....
</p>
<p>
I had exactly the same experience with DiMaggio, he&#39;s a stupid arrogant person with self-grandeur narcissistic personality.
</p>
<p>
He performed rhinoplasty and discarded 2 of my requirements: do NOT leave it with that &#39;&#39;curve&#39;&#39; on the bridge because I like straight noses, and let&#39;s make it not so broad and wide on the nostrils front-view.
</p>
<p>
Also he did a strange ridiculous cut at my forehead for lifting, because &#39;&#39;there you have less hair on one side and the incision was to pull the skin inside&#39;&#39;...(which left the right parietal zone with a ripping skin sensation).
</p>
<p>
As a surgeon he&#39;s very good if he just listen to his patients, better said his clients.
</p>
<p>
Now I see why he&#39;s friend with Javier Belinky, the one who did my SRS 1 year ago, who was the most hellish of a bad experience due to Belinky being a sick psychopath who doesn&#39;t care for your health at all. I&#39;ll be posting my experience, now that I&#39;m doing better and recovered my inner force to shout and talk about surgeon&#39;s abuses of power, malpractice and dehumanization.

I just created a post and waiting for approval. I have internal ingrown hair and Belinky said the same: it&#39;s in your head, let&#39;s see how much they last...
</p>
<p>
And things like that. He assured me that ingrown hairs weren&#39;t a problem, don&#39;t worry about that, etc.
</p>
<p>
I do NOT recommend Javier Belinky even if you pay him with USD in hand. PM me if you want to discuss more personal details. Results aren&#39;t a work from a renowned and well deserved called a good person, a top surgeon. It&#39;s just &#34;ok&#34;. But the most important thing is how he treates you because your whole health depends on a human personality and you&#39;re ultra vulnerable. DiMaggio is a clown and insecure guy.  I had glotis collapse  couldn&#39;t breath properly, and he said &#34;you need a psychiatrist&#34;. They both are friends, you can make your conclusions.
</p>
<p>
EDIT: in ARG they do PIV, Colon-V, and skin-graft techniques.

I am very sad this happened to you also because I heard very many similar complaints about this surgeon that perform what he want to and not what the patiente asked before. I hope you can finish your procedures in a right place and thank you very much for sharing this experience to us in order to be prevented of him. Many many kisses 😘😘😘♥️♥️♥️

I&#39;m deciding between him and Cardenas. I also want more agresive change for my jaw. But to be honest Rossi also has some reports of bad manners.

Genuinely thank you for your information. I&#39;m at the beginning of a decade long journey moving from Kansas to Argentina. Spent my first long term time there from early July to mid August. In that Im also looking into potential surgeons there. Right now focusing on CABA and Collegies for potential housing. All that to say this is definitely a surgeon I&#39;ve considered. And it&#39;s good to know while I wander the net

I have chosen family in the country and that&#39;s exactly what they told me to do. Another reason why I&#39;m pushing things out so far. I&#39;m getting my degree here so I can get the remote set up before I go

doing a lip lift and a rhinoplasty at the same time is dangerous and runs a risk of necrosis. i’m so sorry this happened to you
