So I had my top surgery consult today with Dr. Angela Rodriguez at the Crane Center in the Bay Area. On paper, everything went amazing, but as Dr. Rodriguez walked out after the exam room to talk about surgery type etc, she misgendered me. And then my friend I brought with me said that nobody in the office had gendered me correctly when they were talking about me when I wasn&#39;t in the room (nobody asked my pronouns, either). And even though everything else went great, I can&#39;t help but feel so so shitty about the whole experience because of it. I feel heartbroken. Like I feel like using correct pronouns is kinda the most bar-on-the-ground,
<em>
basic
</em>
respect you can show a trans person?! I was looking forward to this so much and now I just feel like they see me as an opportunity for them to get paid, not as a full human seeking help and medical care. So my question is this: has anyone ever had any issues like this pursuing gender affirming surgery? If so, how did you handle it? I honestly want to ask my insurance to assign me a different surgeon because of it. :(

: I meant FTM in the title* . .

: I just spoke with Dr. Rodriguez over the phone and she apologized profusely and I felt really seen and heard and I decided I want to continue with her as my surgeon and stay with the Crane Center. Thank you all for your really validating comments and support, you all helped me feel like I had a big family rooting for me. &lt;3 I feel safe and really excited to proceed and will post more updates as I get closer to my surgeryyyy!!!!!!

Oh shoot. It seems like they don&#39;t care about patient, but about money. Misgendering is awful, especially coming from a person that should help you feel good about your body. I would try to get assigned to another surgeon. Many hugs to you.

Ugh. Yeah.

I would definitely look about getting assigned to another surgeon. It&#39;s important to have one you feel comfortable with.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We at the Crane Center work diligently to make sure all our patients are gendered correctly and treated with respect in order to earn and maintain their trust. Unfortunately, we are human and do slip up on the rare occasion. We are truly sorry that our oversight caused you to question our commitment and passion for working with you and your community. Please know that we take your feedback to heart and are actively working with our registration system (which didn&#39;t capture your preferred pronouns) and our staff to make sure this doesn&#39;t happen again. Thanks again for sharing your experience and concerns with us, and know that you were heard and changes will be made to prevent this from happening again.

Gatekeeping much? Maybe getting top surgery is a step toward that goal. You know, almost like a... what’s the word...
<strong>
<em>
transition
</em>
</strong>
? And it doesn’t matter how well a person “passes,” a surgeon’s staff should always know better.

Keep your comments to yourself if they’re only going to kick someone while they’re down.
