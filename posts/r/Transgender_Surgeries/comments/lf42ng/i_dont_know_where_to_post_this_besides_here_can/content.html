I&#39;ve been dealing with complications from my primary vaginoplasty since November 2019. It sucked and I felt some rather extreme dysphoria and my sense of self worth was really challenged. While I don&#39;t regret having bottom surgery, I do regret having bottom surgery when I did with the team I did.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky in that I have a very solid support network to help me work through my mental struggles and get me onto anti-depressants. For quite a while I didn&#39;t want anything to do with my genitals. I somewhat got over it, but still had to be very careful in what I was doing with them so as to not trigger a dysphoric cycle.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, I was able to get a revision approved with a much more experienced surgeon, and I&#39;m now 2 days post-op. I&#39;m absurdly bruised and swollen again, but it already seems to be an improvement. A sub-optimal primary outcome can usually be improved on. It sucks to be in the position of needing a revision and feeling mangled / mutilated, and not having a solid support network would have made it much more of a struggle, but I was able to make it through.
</p>
<p>
I also noticed in your post history that you haven&#39;t had access to estrogen for some days now. That might be making things worse for you.
</p>
<p>
I hope you&#39;re able to work through your challenges and come out the other side.

I totally get this. I&#39;ve been through the same ordeal.  I Just had my 3rd revision surgery. I&#39;ve been dealing with complications now for 4 years. I have to take meds to urinate. When you add the fact I have very little sensation, and even more cosmetic issues, it&#39;s all  been a difficult struggle that most people can&#39;t begin to comprehend. There&#39;s never a quick fix for anything, it takes months and months to get through one revision at a time and at more cost.
</p>
<p>
My surgeon told me 6 to 10 weeks total recovery in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the crazy part though, and where it differs from the OP,  I wouldn&#39;t give it back in a million years. LOL. Seriously, it&#39;s mine and I&#39;m keeping it no matter what. Even at my worst, I felt this way.

Today marks my 3 year mark since I got my bottom surgery. And I still am having mechanical difficulty urinating. When I need  to urinate, my sphincter muscles do not want to open. Even when I am  totally relaxed. There  are also times where my tube feels tight and swells up and I would need  to self-catheterize to drain my bladder. If I self-catheterize, I would  need to pass the tube pass my sphincter muscle and that helps air it  out. Can I ask you what kinds of symptoms you are having? Are you taking Flomax to help with urination? What have you done to manage your complications? This situation really has affected my quality of life and I regret getting the surgery because of this complication. We take things for granted in life.

Absolutely! My problem started right after my surgery. I got gaslighted into believing that it would all get back to normal eventually and I believed it. I worked on this problem constantly. To be more specific, I don’t have any force behind my pee. I also have urge incontinence. So now I have a bladder I can’t control that contracts at a specific level whether I like it or not —without meds. You have to go thru Urodynamics testing for all the assessment numbers. In the beginning, when I could relax and find some odd position, I could get a gravity-fed trickle. It’s still like that now. With the addition of Flo-max, it dilates my urethra enough that it’s not as much of a trickle. Then I take Vesicare to control my bladder contractions. If you take these meds, you know they only last a day, so it’s not even an option of skipping them. and I’ve gotten up twice at night and passed out from the Flo-max. So, ya, it sucks. It’s funny how taking a life time of medication wasn’t on the risk list prior to surgery. I never would have thought I would go thru all this and the answer to my urinary problem would be you’ll have to take these two pricey medications for the rest of your life. It makes me angrier all the time. I’m still looking for an answer for this problem too.

Thanks for getting back to me sis. I too had immediate complications right after my surgery. I wasn&#39;t able to pee at all once my catheter was taken out. It was completely blocked and swollen and the catheter had to be reinserted again. Mind you this was three years ago and I had to get a urethral revision. And am still traumatized to this day. Today, I&#39;m still having issues urinating and encountering the opposite of what you are facing; where my tube feels tight at times and I have to self dilate my urethra with a catheter just to &#34;air it out&#34; in order to feel sensation to pee and to drain my bladder. My sphincter muscles doesn&#39;t want to open even though I&#39;m completely relaxed . My stream is weak and I&#39;m on Flomax to help with my flow. My urologists have done so many tests on me and they can&#39;t seem to figure it out. It&#39;s frustrating and has affected my quality of life. Sigh.

I take it they did Urodynamics and that didn&#39;t give them any clues? That&#39;s how they figured out at what point my bladder muscles were involuntarily were firing. I can&#39;t remember the number of ML&#39;s but s soon as it filled to that point it contracted. I have nothing to say about it unless I take the meds. This caused a lot of problems for me trying to work I might add.

Yes. The urodynamics suggested a few diagnoses: 1)The bladder muscle does not contract as strong as it should. 2) dysfunctional voiding where my pelvic floor contractions during urination impedes urinary flow. 3) possible obstruction from a urethral stricture located right at the junction of the sphincter and the rest of the urethra. I&#39;m currently taking Flomax at night to help with the flow.

Have you had the privilege of waking up after Flo-Max and passing out before you get to the bathroom. That&#39;s happened to me twice and it was not funny in the slightest.

Pfffbbttt...Ya Ya, where the fuck are you when patients really need you? Nowhere to be found is my experience. The truth is, if you do you legal homework you&#39;ll discover they don&#39;t legally have to disclose much of anything that isn&#39;t covered in the consent forms.You&#39;ll  just end up causing more harm than good with your, &#34;sue every one of the surgeons&#34; approach.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever looked at an informed consent agreement they make you sign an our before your surgery? And it&#39;s not just gender-affirming surgeries, it&#39;s all surgery.

I notice your posting on detrans. I would advise you to avoid that sub as it’s likely to make things worse, use
<a href="/r/actual_detrans">r/actual_detrans
</a>
instead.
</p>
<p>
There’s a large number of anti trans people following you. I’d not engage with them.

Depression does not magically go away with meds only, youll need therapy too or social support every day. Ive dealt with it years ago. And alone, no matter how much meds I took i wouldnt have made it

I remember reading some of your posts before about your struggles. I’m really sorry to head about the issues you are going through. I’m post op too if you want to talk about anything, but I also just wanted to let you know that I think you are truly beautiful from your pictures, regardless on if you have post op issues or decide to detrans.

I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re feeling so much anguish about being post-op. I was wondering if there was a specific situation, outcome or event that triggered those feelings?  Genuine question, I&#39;m not trying to find some loophole to cast doubt on the way you feel.

I certainly wouldn’t agree with your self-assessment of looking like a disgusting freak, but it sounds like you are you’re referring to your overall appeal experience here and not just your genitals. It looks like you had these feeling prior to your BA as well. Did you ever voice your concerns to your surgeons?

Also don’t forget that if you are still having issues with the internal aspect of your vagina you can have PPV surgery which is the lubricating peritoneal tissue. Also most neo vaginas don’t look great before labiaplasty. Which is what makes it all pretty and stuff. You’re a very pretty girl but post surgery depression is extremely real.

I had a horrific recovery. I bled for 8 months. Like you I had a second op to correct issues. At that 8 month mark I was in a similar place to what you describe. If I could have saved a magic wand, I would have gone back in a heartbeat. Eventually I got past the recovery and felt a lot better
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m now five years post op. And I have a little more perspective that when I was in the middle of it.
</p>
<p>
I would say I am 80-85% ok with what I have.
</p>
<p>
-Aesthetically it&#39;s ok. Pretty good even. There&#39;s a couple of things I would change if I ever got another surgery down there. I suspect no straight man would notice, but a lesbian might.
</p>
<p>
-I have a lot of scar tissue around the entrance. The Suporn method leaves a scar ring. For some it&#39;s minor, but mine is significant and very tight. The larger dilator is excruciating. If I do it daily, then after a few weeks it&#39;s ok, but it will quickly drop back to being uncomfortable if I go less frequent. I suspect that larger guys would just be impossible.
</p>
<p>
-I get a good degree of lubrication. Enough for a finger or two, but would need lube for proper penetration.
</p>
<p>
-I lost a fair bit of depth. I started with 7&#34;. I&#39;m down to 5&#34; now.
</p>
<p>
-pH balance is hard to maintain.
