Im not sure but is it possible that work is stressing you more? Maybe you are unintentionally clenching down there and it’s making it harder to dilate? Im totally just guessing but the work stress is definitely enough to mess with lots of things.

That was my thought too, or else that sitting all day instead of laying and walking was causing problems. I&#39;m just wondering if anyone has any strategies or things that worked for them regarding pelvic floor. Roth said that my pelvic floor is the thickest he&#39;s ever seen, so I&#39;m imagining that anything that causes it to contract would be an issue for me.

Well there are pelvic floor therapists that help with stuff like that. Also idk if its too soon or not but what about yoga? Maybe just doing some stretching poses will do something.

I didn&#39;t think you had to dilate as much with this technique?

Yes, but you do still have to dilate. Especially in the first couple of months it&#39;s important to dilate. Eventually it&#39;ll be down to once a week though.

It can take awhile for the pelvic swelling to resolve. If I’m up too much the swelling makes it difficult to dilate. Do you still get times when you feel swollen inside?

Yes. It waxes and wanes. The best time for me to dilate seems to be right as I wake up before I&#39;ve done anything.

It may just be the swelling changing. Also, scar tissue changes a lot as it heals. As the scar matures, the tissue tries to contract and it can make dilating more difficult. It became harder for me to dilate at around 60-70 days. It’s still difficult now, but I think getting slowly better. I’m about 90 days postop. I’ve found dilating more often to be better than dilating for longer periods less frequently. So if you dilate 2x daily, maybe increase to 3x daily and see if that helps…

I was taught to inhale upon insertion as the pelvic floor opens up upon inhalation &amp; butterfly position ( legs spread wide ) to get the last couple dots in

I&#39;ve read this is pretty common around the 3 month mark. Maybe increase the time you spend dilating everyday so you don&#39;t lose depth?

Depth isn&#39;t the issue, I&#39;m told that I can always train width later so I&#39;m on my skinniest dilators and maintaining depth just fine. I&#39;m just really bummed I lost out on almost half of the width I&#39;d achieved. THey are ordering some physical therapy for me though, hope that helps.
