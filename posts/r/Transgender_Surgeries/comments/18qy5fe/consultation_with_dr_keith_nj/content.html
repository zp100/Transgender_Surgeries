Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
I had checked into Dr. Keith and attempted to contact him late spring last year. Emailed and left voicemail but never heard back.
</p>
<p>
That worked out for me because I wanted a full PPT and am now scheduled this coming June with Dr. Wittenberg. ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
I had not found anything negative about Dr. Keith, so it looks like youâ€™ll be in good hands.

Has anything new come to your attention I had a consult with him around the same time and now have a surgery date with him in April 2025 (originally offered me march but pushed it back a month to have a full year or laser)
