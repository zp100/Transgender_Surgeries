These are fantastic results! I&#39;ve really been questioning doing for this myself and the more I hang out in this subreddit the more encouraging everything is. Thank you for posting your results and the revision details!

Thank you, that means a lot! I&#39;m still getting used to her and should probably stop comparing myself to other people&#39;s vulvas.

If you don&#39;t mind, I have a question. How has been dilation after removing the scar tissue? I&#39;m in a somewhat similar situation, I was too afraid to use the biggest dilator and my body has probably a tendency to form excessive scars (which I didn&#39;t knoe before surgery) and so I got one inside my vagina which made it narrower, despite still keeping dilating everyday. I&#39;ve scheduled a second intervention with the same surgeon set in couple weeks, he said he&#39;s going to break the excessive scarring performing me a strong dilation under anesthesia and I should be fine after that. Dilating has been complicated since the beginning, it occurred me 30 to 60 minutes to just insert the smaller dilator to depth... I know it&#39;d be different since I got penile inversion, but I was just wondering if you had it easier with dilations after your revision. (Besides that, your vulva really looks natal to me).

Thank you for your comment and question. If I remember correctly the Dr simply cut away the piece of scar tissue I had formed at my vaginal entrance but I&#39;ve also heard of the method you&#39;ve described which just makes more sense for internal scarring.
</p>
<p>
Dilating has been much easier post revision. I&#39;m currently just struggling with the left over erectile tissue which gets really hard durring arousal and kinda blocks my vagina, it&#39;s better than it was before revision but still bad enough to keep me from having comfortable penetration. The dilators I&#39;m using are firm enough to push back the swelling, but I feel like it keeps me from relaxing completely and releasing tension in my pelvic floor muscles.

If I remember correctly I payed about €17.000, transport and accommodations (for a month for me and my partner) included. The revision was €4000 for the surgery and a one night stay at the hospital, transport and accommodations excluded. My first surgery was in 2022 and the revision in 2023.

I&#39;m from Belgium so I didn&#39;t really compare him with other Brazilian surgeons. I was looking for an alternative to PI within Europe and had my surgery with him in Portugal.

He is a great surgeon! His FFS work is also impeccable, I&#39;ve seen results in person and could barely notice any scarring.

Well done on your amazing result, which, post-revision, should only make you more elated.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for mentioning his FFS work because I was unsure about the quality of his work, since I can&#39;t find any results online. I assume he does BA. Do you know if he does shoulder reduction as well?

He also does FFS? Did you see any lip lift from him? Any visible scars? Are the FFS results feminine and clean?

I believe my friend had a lip lift amongst forehead, nose and jaw work and I cannot see any scarring besides maybe the hairline a teeny tiny bit. I didn&#39;t even realise she had had FFS when I met her and just assumed she had a naturally feminine face.

His FFS work is very subtle and natural looking. He won&#39;t give you someone else&#39;s face but instead brings out your own femininity.

Thank you so much. BTW your vagina is perfect. Since 2018 I&#39;ve seen millions of SRS photos/results and yours and a few from Dr Banks are the most beautiful and clean. Did you meet some other patients of Dr Littleton? Do his results constantly look like yours? No major visible scars, pink and beautiful interior without any evident holes? Symmetric and small exterior? Are you satisfied with your clit hood? Does he do anterior and posterior commissure?

I was also left was erectile tissue that swells uncomfortably when I’m aroused, making everything look lopsided and feeding my dysphoria. Following to see what people say about revisions for this

The erectile tissue I had left after the first surgery was much worse and even painful. It&#39;s already much better now but still gets in the way and surprisingly also triggers my dysphoria. It&#39;s like a part of my penis is still there and basically being a cock block 🥲
</p>
<p>
I plan on having a consultation with a local surgeon to see if they can help me. But hopefully other people will also leave some advice here.

Does this erectile tissue have arousal tendencies? Is it arousing ? Because I have been thinking of designing my lien SRS technique which involve lining the the vaginal canal laterally to create a sensate opening just like the 5cm sensate region in cis vaginas. And before you ask let me say that the area will be kept open through dilation as well.

The tissue swells up on arousal but to me personally isn&#39;t arousing. It actually triggers my dysphoria a bit because it looks and feels strange and out of place to me.

I think the erectile tissue is a problem because it blocks my vaginal entrance when I get aroused.
</p>
<p>
I really disliked the scars before my revision but don&#39;t mind them now knowing they&#39;ll fade nicely. I&#39;m not completely sure about the shape of my labia minora because they seem too uniform which makes them look unnatural to me.
</p>
<p>
The first surgery, flight and post surgery accommodations for two people for a month included, was about €17.000. The revision was €4000 for the surgery (don&#39;t remember how much I payed for my flight and three week stay in Portugal post op).

My only issue was not his skills or ability but after care in Brazil as I’d have to travel by my self - I had my canal fixed by Theerapong Sigmoid Colon 2022 fall  , it works good my canal finally but Littleton does the best it appears aesthetically and I still have a mess that doesn’t even look close to natal , I wonder what he could really do for me ? - Theerapong did basically nothing aesthetically other than the colon , I’m choked and being Ghosted by Theerapong the “ Saving Face “ scenario that you get in an Asian Country if you complain , I’m legit with complaining - if Littleton had better communication I’d go down to Brazil and have a revision ? But it’s such a but ?

Oh no, I&#39;m sorry to hear Theerapong has been treating you that way. That&#39;s not professional at all.
</p>
<p>
Littleton and his team are professional in their communication but unfortunately take AGES to reply. It&#39;s my only critique I have of them.

I was all game last year for Jejunum but after care and lack of response took me aback going to Littleton needing at least a week in Hospital then what ! Lay around by myself in a Brazilian Hotel on my own with no care scared the crap out of me going to Littleton ?- I said my piece about this to Littleton he offered that I could stay a month in a Portugal Hospital to recover but Ha ! In Euro dollars ? I don’t think so , money doesn’t grow on a tree - He said on email to get checked for pre screening doing Sigmoid just in case of possible cancer issues post op -
</p>
<p>
my issue now is did I say too much to Littleton and get blacklisted by him also for maybe going for aesthetics needed - Littleton does his incisions between minora and majora - Kunaporn is his mentor and started doing Jejunum, if I had known I would have gone to Kunaporn in Phuket - it’s done now and works from Theerapong but I never even got a consult from this guy one on one just an exam then surgery -
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any scars from Kamols original Scrotal PI but Kunaporn was talking graphs from my groin and don’t want the extra scares if I can avoid it plus possible graphs dying off after and end up with a real mess - I have some minora just too much majora fat and originally Littleton said he could do something before Theerapong did his Sigmoid but basically only did external soluble sutures that never held symmetrical looking so it reverted back to Kamols original surgery -
</p>
<p>
I need an artist to open things up properly and re-align all the skin something Theerapong did not do and at the same time remove all this extra majora fat with a scalpel not screwing around with BS Lipo would make me happy ( but nobody really listens ? ) so it doesn’t look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa - it’s getting costly now bottom line if I could have had a proper consult with Theerapong and he speaks English to get true answers what he could do and not do - World wide Littleton seems the only one left - Brazilian surgeons are more aggressive to make things happen , there surgery Laws allow for this it appears !

If I remember correctly I payed about €17.000, transport and accommodations (for a month for me and my partner) included. The revision was €4000 for the surgery and a one night stay at the hospital, transport and accommodations excluded. My first surgery was in 2022 and the revision in 2023.

It really looks great to me! Totally get the insecurities you mentioned but I genuinely wouldn&#39;t be able to tell it wasn&#39;t natal from looking at it and think it looks great!  In terms of the erectile tissue &amp; pain, I wonder if working with a pelvic floor therapist would help at all in the meantime?  Obviously that won&#39;t get rid of the excess tissue, but I can imagine all that stress and trauma from having issues the first time might lead to a lot of tensing in expectation of pain... I hope you can find someone local to help you get that solved though.  Surgery is such a journey!  Your results honestly look amazing though :)

Your vulva looks perfect for me! Now i am planning to go to this  surgeon but i am so afraid that mine will not look as good as yours ( For me your result is the best and the most natal looking one (especially inside) for 2 years of browsing for srs results. I thought of bank previously but now i switched to littleton

I was incredibly weak after surgery. I couldn&#39;t get up at first when they asked me to and nearly passed out a couple of times on that first day. Eventually I got up and was able to take more steps every day.
</p>
<p>
You&#39;ll get there, just be kind to yourself and get plenty of rest. Everyone&#39;s experience is different.

Thank you so much. Today I manage to take few steps and stay 10 mins up untill my brain start to pass out again. So I guess that my experience is matching yours. Thank you very much for this

Yes, I followed your advice. I am getting better. I will leave the hospital tomorrow and I am preparing for that moment &#39;cause I am going with an UBER and I get a bit scare of passing out. But I am almost sure I will arrive at home smoothly and keep resting until the next consultation, 1 week from now =) I am really happy with my new body, It is such a dream come true, an expensive one, but still a dream =P

Bring some pillows with you and ask the driver if it&#39;s possible to sit in the front with the backrest reclined so there&#39;s as little pressure on your groin as possible.

Dr. Márcio told me to go on the bavk seat, I will talk with him better in the morning. My boyfriend already brought 2 pillows for me. Wish me luck =) thank you so much for your words and btw your results look really perfect, wish mine could be close to yours, it is so cis-like

Just another question. I just arrived home, it was such a scary trip, but it went ok... I&#39;m now resting a lot to have strenghs to deal with everything else I need to do. The difficult now it is how to stay in bed, because in the hospital the bed could be moved between different angles, but how do I do this at home. I am so freaking scared =S

If you&#39;re with friends or a partner ask them to put extra pillows behind your back and help you sit up when you want to sit up a bit. When you have to get out of bed you should use the technique Dr Marcio showed you and use your abdominal muscles as little as possible.

Yes. That is exactly what I am doing. Using extra pillows. It is so f***ing hard to pass through this. I always use Dr Marcio&#39;s technique, &#39;cause I am really affraid of damaging anything. I am in the middle of the second week. Even walking is weird and difficult, I get out of breath everytime I do it... well in 3 months I hope to be enjoying my life after all this suffering. Thank you very much for your answers, this is really calminh my heart. I am portuguese, btw, so I can&#39;t imagine what people from other countries that come here to the the surgery pass through...

Yeah I was walking around like a grandma for at least three weeks. But that&#39;s completely ok, it&#39;s better to walk slowly and take your time than to rupture sutures or over exhaust yourself.

I believe it&#39;s kept there (it&#39;s there naturally) to help protect your urethra after surgery. But sometimes it&#39;s difficult to tell if you&#39;ve removed enough of it.

Thank you, I also always swell up like crazy after surgery. After my initial surgery my labia minora were so swollen I thought they had burst apart.

My experience with Dr Littleton himself was great! He&#39;s a very understanding surgeon that will take the time to answer any and all questions you might have. He also takes pride in his work and will give you detailed instructions on aftercare and dilation. Post surgery he came to check up on me daily to make sure everything was healing well and I was getting the right meals etc. Overall he struck me as a calm and caring person tho maybe a little socially awkward but that could also have been due to the language barrier.
</p>
<p>
I had my surgery at the hospital de jesus in Lisbon, the hospital and nursing staff was very kind and did their job very well but most weren&#39;t fluent in English which was sometimes a little stressful and worrying. Just something to keep in mind. If you don&#39;t speak Portuguese fluently I suggest keeping Google Translate at hand.
</p>
<p>
Dr Littleton&#39;s administrative team isn&#39;t the best, his current secretary has a better proficiency in English than the previous one but their rate of response is still very slow. On average it takes a couple of weeks to several months to arrange a consultation and multiple weeks to just get a response when asking questions. Talking to other patients of his and people wanting to get surgery with him I&#39;ve heard the same feedback.

SRS/GRS (especially when using a mucal graft) is a very intricate surgery that&#39;s also very demanding of the body so I&#39;m not surprised that often times it&#39;s difficult to get the esthetics absolutely spot on the first time round.
</p>
<p>
After my first surgery I had so much swelling that it took at least six months for me to see what my final vulva might look like. It&#39;s also common to have complications with a surgery as complicated as this one so I&#39;m very lucky I only had some minor ones.
</p>
<p>
Even though it was an intense and stressful experience I don&#39;t regret it one bit.

I technically have to dilate 30 minutes a day, but with the preparation and clean up it&#39;s usually closer to an hour which is still very manageable compared to the dilation schedule for PI. This can in time be replaced by penetrative sex a couple of times a week/month. I try to dilate daily still but sometimes skip a couple of days or a week without issue.

The revision looks amazing! How long did you wait after GRS to do the first revision?
</p>
<p>
Minor scarring at the top but nothing a little pubic hair can’t cover. Your doctor did god tier on the labia and outer labia.

What is erectile tissue during arousal?

Thank you!
</p>
<p>
There was 14 months in between my SRS/GRS and the revision. I had my first surgery in March of 2022 and my revision in May this year.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ll probably eventually get some laser on the scar on my pubic mount to help flatten it a bit more but pubic hair also works as a great cover up. The scar also isn&#39;t perfectly vertical so it doesn&#39;t necessarily read as something related to surgery.
</p>
<p>
The erectile tissue is simply that. Left over erectile tissue that swells up when aroused. It&#39;s normal to have a little bit of it but I feel like mine is a bit excessive as it gets in the way of penetration. I&#39;ll be having a consultation with a local surgeon to see if they can get rid of it.

Honestly i would go back to Littleton to this last touch up.. i would be scared to go to another surgeon but maybe that&#39;s me... Or i would make the two surgeons in contact so that the local surgeon know how to manage it

Try using a more slippery lube, I believe the erectile tissue could possibly help you get better orgasms especially from penetration.

Possibly, although I&#39;m not sure it will as the swelling is actually a little uncomfortable.

I have not been able to get a second opinion yet but dilation has been ok. It seems to have gotten less of an issue.

Hello..i had the consult with him and i mentioned the erectile tissue problem one of his patients had... Do you think this erectile tissue was corpora cavernosa or just spongeous tissue? He told me that he removes the corpora cavernosa completely...

I believe it to be the latter, but I still need to discuss this complication with him.

&#34;I wouldn&#39;t look completely natal&#34;
</p>
<p>
I think your vulva was completely natal after the first surgery. Most people won&#39;t have enough knowledge about anatomy to notice the difference between natal and neo vaginas...
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m going to do my SRS with him in January 2023 (I&#39;m from Brazil and I will undergo SRS in Rio de Janeiro), and I&#39;m afraid that people that I will have sex may notice that it isn&#39;t a natal vagina... most men say they know, but they don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t wanna tell people I&#39;m trans, y&#39;know? I don&#39;t tell to most friends, and I don&#39;t tell at my work and college. I don&#39;t have any sexual and/or romantic relationship nowadays because of this (would need to tell). Would you mind if I send you a text about preparation for the Surgery, and post-op?

Hi! Did he ask for laser or electrolysis before the surgery?

No, that wasn&#39;t necessary as non of the scrotal or penile tissue is used for the vaginoplasty only during the vulvoplasty.
