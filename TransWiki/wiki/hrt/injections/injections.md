I've summarized some information here, but make sure you research properly elsewhere as I don't know much about this and have no practical experience. Writing this is my way of learning, and I may as well share.

This is mainly related to injecting HRT, although injecting lidocaine is kind of interesting due to its use in electrolysis and implants/pellets.

# Injection Techniques

There are two injection techniques for HRT and there appears to be no difference in how effective they are for HRT.

* *Subcutaneous* uses very fine relatively short needles and is apparently painless, or nearly so. It is more prone to allergic reactions at the injection side than intramuscular.
* *Intramuscular* uses a much longer and larger needle to inject deep into the muscle. I've not looked into it too much as I don't think I could do this.

The empty syring package is sterile and can be used to temporarily store the prepared syring before use rather than placing it on a potentially non-sterile surface.

Injecting cold liquid may be more painful than room temperature. However oils are also more viscous at cold temperatures, so you might want to warm it up anway. There's also a risk of estradiol crystalising out of solution in the cold (crashing).

### Fainting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine) - *"Syncope, commonly known as fainting, is a loss of consciousness and muscle strength characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery. It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain, typically from low blood pressure. There are sometimes symptoms before the loss of consciousness such as lightheadedness, sweating, pale skin, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm. Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching. Psychiatric causes can also be determined when a patient experiences fear, anxiety, or panic; particularly before a stressful event usually medical in nature. When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called presyncope. It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope."*

# Syringes and Needles

Ideally you want to draw and inject quickly, accuratly, and with minimal pain. The choice of syringe and needle depends on a number of trade-offs.

* It's slower/not possible to inject a thick oil though a very fine needle.
* You can inject anything through a large enough needle, but they hurt more.
* Injectable estrogen is available in various viscosity (thickness) oils, although it may be difficult to choose what you get
* Injectable lidocaine for local anaesthetic is mostly water and cab be injected though very fine needles.
* Subcutaneous injections require short needles; intramuscular injections require long needles.
* Using a needle to draw the liquid from a vial blunts it, increasing pain. Changing to a new needle for the injection reduces pain.
* The volume of liquid (hence dose) cannot be measured accurately when only a small proportion of the syringe is filled.
* Some syringes & needles have reduced dead space, which is the amount of wastage for each injection.
* Syring and needle costs vary greatly. Needles cost around AUD $5 per box of 100 in Australia; syringes cost more.
* There's only two types of syringes in common use
    * Insulin syringes are available from 0.3ml to 1.0ml, are low dead space, and have very fine and short fixed needles.
    * Luer-Lok syringes are cheap, available in sizes 1ml and up, have a wide range of needles, allow the needle to be changed after drawing, and can be used with a wide range of needle sizes. There appear to be only one 0.5ml Luer-Lok syringe, the low dead space [MinimLL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=You_OlfnQfo); its expensive and not available everywhere.

In practice this means that if you want to inject 0.1ml you'll need to use an insulin syringe. As these have short needles you'll need to perform a subcutaneous injection, and the oil must be thin enough to draw through the fine gauge needle. Conversely, if you want to an intramuscular injection you can't use the short needle on an insulin syringe, so you must use at least a 1ml+ Luer-Lok (or Slip) syringe and can't accurately inject a very small amount. If you want to inject a very thick oil you'll need to use a larger gauge needle, again the 1ml+ Luer-Lok syringe. Given these constraints there are some types of injections that are not practical.
 

Don't use too large a drawing needle as it can damage the cap of the estrogen vial (if you're using one rather than a [glass ampule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampoule)), leading to rubber fragments in the vial and/or leakage. This is referred to as coring, <span class="internal">[see below](https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/injections/injections.md#coring)</span>.

Wipe the septum (stopper) of a vial clean with a 70% alcohol pad to stealize it before use, both on the first and subsequent uses (or not as there's reccomendations that its not neccessary).

* [WHO Best Practices for Injections and Related Procedures Toolkit.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK138495/) by World Health Organization in 2010

*[Luer-Lok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luer_taper)* syringes have a locking twist mechanism that prevents the needle popping off the syringe under pressure (ie when injecting a thick oil through a fine needle). *Luer-Slip* syringes use friction fitting to hold the needle on the syringe. The needle used for these types of syringes fits both Luer-Lok and Luer-Slip syringes. For thick oil based injections (ie estradiol) use Luer-Lok as self-injecting is bad enough without the syringe falling apart, and worse, not knowing how much you've already injected.

Finer, smaller diameter needles cause less pain.

Needle diameters are specified using the [Birmingham gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_gauge). A smaller number indicates a larger diameter needle, so a 23G (gauge) needle that might be used for drawing (from the vial) is larger than a 30G used to inject. The needles are color coded, and I've noticed the few times I've asked a doctor what gauge they are using they didn't know (and don't seem to care all that much). They go by color.

The maximum length of needles tends to reduce as the diameter of the needle decreases. The maximum length of a 30G needle is around 0.5", while 22G needles are easily available up to 1.5". Longer 1" 30G needles do exist (BD 305128, Terumo NN-3025R), but are difficult to find, expensive, and are not available in Australia at all. However, it seems unlikely these would be  useful for injecting estrogen as they are too long for subcutaneous and probably too short for intramuscular injections (and assuming you can push the oil through them). 30G 1" needles are also available on Aliexpress, however buying medical supplies from these kinds of sites seems rather risky.

Its difficult to find needles smaller than 30G, although they are available up to around 33G, where the cost starts increasing rapidly. The smallest one's I've found are the low dead space [TSK Invisible Needle](https://www.tsklab.com/the-invisible-needle/) which they say are 14% thinner than their 33G needles. I don't think it would be possible to uses these to inject estrogen as the oils are too thick to push through such a fine needle. Due to the varying viscosity of oils you may need to experiment with the minimum size of the needle and time taken to do the injection - or just use a large diameter needle and not worry about it. I would guess these fine needles are usable for injecting local anaesthetics  for electrolysis, but doctors probably won't have them as they are very expensive, harder to source, and as the needle is short it would require more injections and time. The TSK needle Invisible Needle is only 9mm, and the slightly larger TSK 33G needle is half the price (around US$50 vs US$100 per box of 100) and a slightly better 13mm (I believe doctors use *much* larger diameter and longer needles for local anaesthetics - best not think about it).

Some doctors suggest/prescibe 18G needles. Try to avoid them, they are very large diameter, tend to hurt, core vial stoppers, and are unnecessary for HRT. Larger than 18G, eg 16G start to go up in price and no one uses them for HRT, I hope.

Ideally the smallest (volume) syringe possible should be used. Smaller syringes are more accurate and generate higher injection pressure, making it easier to perform the injection (drawing pressure is about the same). Luer slip/lok syringes range from 1ml upwards, while insulin syringes are from 0.3ml to 1.0ml. See <span class="internal">[Dose Accuracy](https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/injections/injections.md#dose-accuracy)</span> and <span class="internal">[Syringe Pressure](https://github.com/zp100/Transgender_Surgeries/blob/main/TransWiki/wiki/hrt/injections/injections.md#syringe-pressure)</span> below.

## Coring

Don't use too large a drawing needle as it can damage the cap of the estrogen vial (if you're using one rather than a [glass ampule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampoule)), leading to rubber fragments in the vial and/or leakage. This is referred to as ***coring***. There are many reports in trans forums of 18G needles damaging the septum (stopper) of the vial and 23G (or 25G) is normally recommended for the draw needle and it appears to completely stop coring. Medical references suggesting angling the needle as its inserted, but its rare to hear anyone in trans spaces suggest this. The difference may be in the way its used - doctors are busy, but we don't mind taking longer to draw from the vial with a finer needle, and we also do it multiple times with the same vial. Don't insert the needle though the same place in the stopper each time.

## Dead Space

Low dead space syringes and needles are designed to minimize the amount of drug remaining in the syringe and needle after injecting. These are useful when the drugs used are expensive.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_dead_space_syringe - *"A low dead space syringe (LDSS) or low dead-volume syringe is a type of syringe with a design that seeks to limit dead space that exists between the syringe hub and needle. "*

The paper 2018 [Options for reducing HIV transmission related to the dead space in needles and syringes](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0207-5) has an [image](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Needle-and-syringe-designs-that-affect-dead-space-a-Standard-high-dead-space-syringe_fig2_322513517) with 4 syringes and their average deadspace. The low deadspace syringe with attached needle should be an insulin syringe. Note that 0.1ml corresponds to 100 µL, so if you were injecting that anmount you'd be wasting the same amount (99 µL) in the deadspace and your vial would last half as long.

Syringe | Deadspace
:--|:--
Standard syringe with standard needle      | 99 µL
Low deadspace syringe with attached needle | 3 µL
Standard syringe with low deadspace needle | 12 µL
Low deadspace syringe with standard needle | 45 µL

## Dose Accuracy

Smaller syringes allow more accurate dosing (assuming its not too small).

The [specification for a 1ml BD Luer-Lok syringe](https://www.bd.com/en-ca/offerings/capabilities/bd-luer-lok-syringe/309629) gives an accuracy of ±5%, but below 0.2ml its 0.07ml. Hence below 0.2ml the accuracy is ±35% at best.

Papers

* 2021 - [Development of Guidelines for Accurate Measurement of Small Volume Parenteral Products Using Syringes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8114303/) by Melanie A. Jordan, Dimpa Choksi, Kelsey Lombard, and Lynn R. Patton - *"... we recommend that users measure no less than 20% of the indicated volume of the syringe while choosing syringes as close as possible to the desired measurement"*
* 2019 - [the illusion of accuracy](https://connect.ashp.org/blogs/dennis-tribble/2019/03/05/the-illusion-of-accuracy?ssopc=1) by Dennis Tribble - *"The most accurate syringe in common use has an accuracy of ±4% when its nominal volume is 5 mL or greater when delivering at 50% or more of its nominal volume. ... Syringes below 5 mL are accurate if they can deliver within ±5% when measuring 50% or more of their nominal volume. ... Below 50% of its nominal volume, the accuracy of the syringe declines with the volume measured until, at 10% of its nominal volume, it delivers ±16% accuracy."*

## Syringe Pressure

Smaller syringes generate more pressure when injecting. eg 361 psi for 1ml vs. 177 psi for 3ml, see [Hayward 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21469942/). The syringe size and needle diameter makes little difference to maximum vacumn, measured around 10 psi by [Haseler 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21057795/) (10 psi is the 517 Torr of the paper). The maxiumum pressure generated by a vacumn is the [atmospheric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure), around 14.696 psi at sea level (on Earth).

We can see then that the injection pressure is *far* greater than the draw pressure, and we can therefore inject far thicker liquids than we can draw. Hence we use larger needles to draw than to inject. 

In principle we could inject/draw thick liquids through fine needles, but at some point the time taken to do so makes it impractical.

In practice the needle size for thick oils may need to be determined experimentally. ie try it and see how it goes.

Thus, syringe and RPD size had a significant effect on the strength of vacuum generated, with the 20 ml syringe and RPD each generating a maximum vacuum of approximately −517 Torr."*

## Backfilling Syringes

Backfilling refers to filling a syringe from the back instead of the usual way though the needle.

The syringe plunger is removed and another syringe is used to fill it. When the needle is fixed and cannot be replaced (e insulin syringes) this avoids blunting it, reducing pain. Where the injected liquid is very thick it may also be faster. However, the cost is higher as a second syringe is used and its more difficult to maintain sterility.

The [Baxter H93813901](https://www.google.com/search?q=baxter+h93813901) shown costs around US$140 for 50 (in 2021).

## Insulin Syringe

Insulin syringes have integrated 29-31g needles, are low dead space, and range from 0.3ml, 0.5ml and 1.0m. As a separate draw needle cannot be used the needle will be slightly blunted when piercing the septum (stopper) of a vial. To avoid this problem some people *backfill* the syringe by removing the plunger from the syringe and filling it from another syringe. Care must be taken to keep everything sterile.

## Tuberculin Syringe

I'm not too sure about this type of syringe, but they appear to be special syringes intended for [tuberculosis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantoux_test). They are low dead space, usually 1ml with a built-in 27 gauge 13mm needle. They are of interest primarily because they are cheaper than insulin syringes, and *far* cheaper than 1ml Luer-Lok syringes.

## Dental Syringes

Dental syringes and needles are not compatible with the normal Luer slip/lok syringes we would use. They are designed to take premade drug carpules (cartridges) of local anaesthetics (eg [Septodont Lignospan](https://www.septodontusa.com/products/lignospan-standard)), in several sizes around 2ml.

I've never heard of anyone making their own carpules, although it appears you can buy the necessary materials on Alibaba or at [bottlecn.com](http://www.bottlecn.com/ls2.asp?ox2=Pharma%20Medical%20Package&boardname=Glass%20Cartridges) (these are 1.5ml and 3ml, which doesn't appear to be a standard size for dental injections). It seems like a waste of time even trying.

## Autoinjectors

## Microliter Syringes

The smallest medical syringes available appear to be 0.3ml insulin syringes with fixed needles, or 1ml Luer slip/lok syringes. These are not ideal if you're using high concentration low volume estradiol injections.

There are smaller syringes available, but they appear to be intended for very specialised and are very expensive.

## Needle Free Injections

I don't know if any of these are suited to injecting viscous oil based liquids (ie hormones), but anaesthetics are more like water so would presumably work.

For anesthetic use it might be best to use these to get the first location numb, then use a normal needle to work out from that area (which should be painless if done properly).

They tend to be very expensive, have consumables, and more suited to professional use.

## Expiry Date

Needles have a 5 year shelf-life, and it's not clear if anyone knows how long they actually last. See Healthline, [Ask D'Mine: Do Needles Expire?](https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/ask-dmine-do-needles-expire)

> Anyway, there you have it. Straight from the source of the Nile. The Needle Makers have chosen a date—perhaps by doing research, perhaps by letting the marketing department pick a date, or perhaps by putting it to the lawyers—and then have proved to themselves that their products will last that long.

## Filter Needles

Some drugs are stored in [glass ampules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampoule) rather than vials, and opening them introduces glass particles into the drug. Apparently there's no evidence of harm so the medical profession has decided its not worth the cost of using filter needles. Personally, I'd rather use a filter needle.

Filter needles are quite large so probably should not be used with reusable vials as they could cause coring.

A [filter needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe_filter) has the filter built into the needle and looks much like a normal needle. There's another type of syringe filter, the wheel filter. I'm not sure which is most appropriate, but I found many references to wheel filters among recreational drug users (I think they crush non-injectable drugs, dissolve the drug part, and filter out all the non-dissolvable part, or something like that). Filters might be used when compounding injectable estradiol.

Filter needles are more expensive than normal needles. An example is US$10 for ten 5 μm (micron) filters at [Westend Medical Supplies](https://westendmedicalsupplies.com/products/bd-19-gauge-1-5-filter-needle). Wheel filters should also be suitable. Filters must be sterile.

## Side Hole Needles

Huber (or Tuohy) needles have a hole in the side of the syringe rather than the top, and is said to reduce/prevent coring (in applications other than drawing from a vial). I'm not confident this is the correct name as some photos show the hole entirely on the side, others do not.

In addition,* ***the forces necessary for puncture or for withdrawal of the needle were increased with Huber-point needles, possibly due to a coring effect.*** *Another disadvantage of the available port needles is the formation of a hook at the tip, which may lead to additional lesion of the port or pump membrane.

I've found that the brand/quality of insulin syringe matters FAR more than whether they've been used to draw before injecting. Under a microscope, I see no difference between a fresh needle and one that I've used to pierce a stopper, draw, pierce skin and inject... Now, I have a box of brand name Easy Touch insulin syringes that are less pleasant to use. They take more pressure to pierce the skin and they tend to drag on the way back out. The bag of no-name insulin syringes that the pharmacist handed me at the grocery store pharmacy don't do any of that and are great. There can be differences in manufacturing quality, such as whether they bevel the point in one slope, two, or sometimes even three... whether they coat the needle with a lubricant and whether they polish the bevels. I've used two needles, a single needle, and fixed needle insulin syringes. I don't notice any difference between a fresh single needle, and a good insulin syringe that has been used to draw the dose, but I DO notice lower quality needles that have never been used even once. Quality of the needle matters more than drawing with the same needle or swapping them. The bottom line is that I prefer the insulin syringes, I use 1/2 inch long needles, 27 gauge draws and injects more easily than 29 gauge, but 29 gauge is fine, just slower."*

You don't need a prescription to buy needles and syringes in Australia, and they can easily be ordered from online stores. Pharmacies may not have what you want in stock, but at least in some cases can order them in for pickup.

You can quite easily find sellers by using google to search for a particular brand of needles on Australian sites. For example, type this into google

Some examples are

* https://www.ebay.com.au - no longer sell needles

# Storing Drugs in Syringes

If you get your HRT in a glass ampule its intended for single use only and the remainder will go to waste. It is possible to injectable estrogen in a syringe, but its not an FDA approved way to do it.

* [FDA notifies health care professionals that Becton-Dickinson replaced problematic rubber stoppers in its syringes](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-notifies-health-care-professionals-becton-dickinson-replaced-problematic-rubber-stoppers-its) in 2018 - *"Becton-Dickinson (BD) informed FDA that it is no longer using the rubber stopper material associated with loss of drug potency in its general use syringes, and BD has instead returned to a rubber stopper it used previously in the syringes. In 2015, FDA initially alerted health care professionals not to administer compounded and repackaged drugs stored in certain sizes of general use BD syringes, based on reports of an interaction with the rubber stopper that caused some drugs stored in these syringes to lose potency when not used immediately. As we stated previously, the general use BD syringes are cleared for immediate use in fluid aspiration and injection, but not for use as a closed container storage system for drug products, and we have not established the suitability of these syringes (with either rubber stopper) for that purpose."*

In the video she leaves an air gap between the liquid and rubber stopper and stands the syringes upright so that the drug never touches the rubber. I expect this is related to the FDA warning in 2015.

* 2015 - [No syringe is approved as a standalone storage container, FDA says](https://academic.oup.com/ajhp/article-abstract/72/21/1831/5111565) by Cheryl A. Thompson - *"The seemingly common practice at pharmacies and outsourcing facilities of storing sterile compounded preparations or repackaging sterile pharmaceuticals in drug-administration syringes is actually an unapproved use of these medical devices, according to FDA. “FDA has not cleared or approved any syringes for stand-alone use as ‘closed container systems,’” the agency informed ASHP via e-mail in September. The matter came to light in late July after BD informed customers that..."*

affect filler shelf life. To what extent filler shelf life is affected by the decanting process is unknown. The author has not experienced any contamination problems with this method, over a 12-month period, where the decanted product is stored no longer than 6–8 weeks and refrigerated when not in use."*
