# BMI

Surgeons have weight/BMI limits, often around 15 to 30 for SRS. It varies among surgeons and the range for colon-vaginoplasty is smaller.

For very large amount of weight loss excess skin may need surgical removal. The reddit fasting sub says that fasting can eliminate this skin through a process called autophagy. I've no idea if that's true.

# Phentermine

I'd not use this if you can avoid it, and use a GLP-1 agonsit instead, but its relativly cheap. Tolerance builds quickly and it has side effects.

https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00191 - *"Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug. It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine. Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential)."*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phentermine - *"with several brand names including Ionamin and Sentis, is a medication used together with diet and exercise to treat obesity. It is taken by mouth for up to a few weeks at a time, after which the benefits subside. It is also available as the combination phentermine/topiramate."*

# GLP-1 Agonists

There's new class of drugs that are extremely effective for weight loss, and very expensive. For most people Tirzepatide is better than Semaglutide, and both appear to be available from diy type sources.

Tolerance builds over time, so it seems like it would be a good idea to achieve weight loss as soon as possibe (or safe), before it stops working properly.

I've seen reccomended (from non-medical sources) to start with low dose of semaglutide and increase it as slowly as possible to reduce side effects and keep it effective as long as possible, then change over to tirzepatide when it stops working and do the same. You may need to be on it for life to stop the weight comming back. Tirzepatide is significantly more expensive that semagludtide.

Another drug for weight loss is Phentermine, although not mearly as effective as Semaglutide or Tirzepatide.

## DIY

DIY for these drugs is a bit different to HRT. No one appear to compound their own. It appears to be sourced from China in vials containing a dry powder that needs reconsitution with "bacteriostatic water", then injected. Prior to being reconstituted it appears to have a relatively long shelf life, but afterwards only a month or so.

I think I know how its compounded, and how it could be done DIY, but its very difficult to find any decent quality information on this. I'll update this when I have some time.
